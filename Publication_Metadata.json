        "Abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been successfully used in patients with bleeding disorders and blindness. For human liver targeting, two major factors restrict effective AAV transduction after systemic administration of AAV vectors: human hepatocyte tropism and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). In this study, we attempted to isolate AAV variants with the ability to transduce human hepatocytes and escape Nabs using a directed evolution approach ",

        "Abstract": "There is much debate on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype that best targets specific retinal cell types and the route of surgical delivery-intravitreal or subretinal. This study compared three of the most efficacious AAV vectors known to date in a mouse model of retinal degeneration (rd1 mouse) and macaque and human retinal explants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a ubiquitous promoter was packaged into three AAV capsids: AAV2/8(Y733F), AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/2(7m8). Overall, AAV2/2(7m8) transduced the largest area of retina and resulted in the highest level of GFP expression, followed by AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/8(Y733F). AAV2/2(7m8) and AAV2/2(quad Y-F) both resulted in similar patterns of transduction whether they were injected intravitreally or subretinally. AAV2/8(Y733F) transduced a significantly smaller area of retina when injected intravitreally compared with subretinally. Retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells and retinal pigment epithelium expressed relatively high levels of GFP in the mouse retina, whereas amacrine cells expressed low levels of GFP and bipolar cells were infrequently transduced. Cone cells were the most frequently transduced cell type in macaque retina explants, whereas Müller cells were the predominant transduced cell type in human retinal explants. Of the AAV serotypes tested, AAV2/2(7m8) was the most effective at transducing a range of cell types in degenerate mouse retina and macaque and human retinal explants.",

        "Abstract": "While gene transfer using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors has shown success in some clinical trials, there remain many tissues that are not well transduced. Because of the recent success in reprogramming islet-derived cells into functional β cells in animal models, we constructed 2 highly complex barcoded replication competent capsid shuffled libraries and selected for high-transducing variants on primary human islets. We describe the generation of a chimeric AAV capsid (AAV-KP1) that facilitates transduction of primary human islet cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived β cells with up to 10-fold higher efficiency compared with previously studied best-in-class AAV vectors. Remarkably, this chimeric capsid also enabled transduction of both mouse and human hepatocytes at very high levels in a humanized chimeric mouse model, thus providing a versatile vector that has the potential to be used in both preclinical testing and human clinical trials for liver-based diseases and diabetes.",

        "Abstract": "Display of short peptides on the surface of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is a powerful technology for the generation of gene therapy vectors with altered cell specificities and/or transduction efficiencies. Following its extensive prior use in the best characterized AAV serotype 2 (AAV2), recent reports also indicate the potential of other AAV isolates as scaffolds for peptide display. In this study, we systematically explored the respective capacities of 13 different AAV capsid variants to tolerate 27 peptides inserted on the surface followed by production of reporter-encoding vectors. Single-round screening in pre-arrayed 96-well plates permitted rapid and simple identification of superior vectors in >90 cell types, including T cells and primary cells. Notably, vector performance depended not only on the combination of capsid, peptide, and cell type, but also on the position of the inserted peptide and the nature of flanking residues. For optimal data availability and accessibility, all results were assembled in a searchable online database offering multiple output styles. Finally, we established a reverse-transduction pipeline based on vector pre-spotting in 96- or 384-well plates that facilitates high-throughput library panning. Our comprehensive illustration of the vast potential of alternative AAV capsids for peptide display should accelerate their in vivo screening and application as unique gene therapy vectors.",

        "Abstract": "In the past decade, recombinant vectors based on a non-pathogenic parvovirus, the adeno-associated virus (AAV), have taken center stage as a gene delivery vehicle for the potential gene therapy for a number of human diseases. To date, the safety of AAV vectors in 176 phase I, II, and III clinical trials and their efficacy in at least eight human diseases are now firmly documented. Despite these remarkable achievements, it has also become abundantly clear that the full potential of first generation AAV vectors composed of naturally occurring capsids is not likely to be realized, since the wild-type AAV did not evolve for the purpose of therapeutic gene delivery. In this article, we provide a brief historical account of the progress that has been made in the development of capsid-modified",

        "Abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) consists of a simple genome, infects mammalian cells, displays nonpathogenicity in humans, and spans an array of serotypes and variants bearing distinct tissue tropisms. These attributes lend AAV tremendous promise as a gene delivery vector, further substantiated by its extensive testing in human clinical trials. Rational design approaches to capsid engineering leverage current scientific knowledge of AAV to further modulate, enhance and optimize the performance of the vectors. Capsid modification strategies include amino acid point mutations, peptide domain insertions, and chemical biology approaches. Through such efforts, insights regarding AAV capsid sequence-structure-function relationships can be learned. Developments over the last 5 years in rational design-based capsid engineering approaches will be presented and discussed.",
