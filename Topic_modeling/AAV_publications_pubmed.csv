Roughly 11% of the blood donors had mixed AAV infections. AAV prevalence was dramatically increased in immunosuppressed patients, 76% of whom were AAV positive. Of these, at least 45% displayed mixed infections. Follow-up of single blood donors over 2 years allowed repeated detection of the initial and/or additional AAV serotypes, suggestive of fluctuating, persistent infection.

In this review, we focus on adeno-associated virus (AAV). Over the last few decades, AAV has become a leading choice for safe gene delivery, in part due to its replication deficiency in cells without a helper virus. Here, we summarize the tropism of recombinant AAV (rAAV) for various types of mammalian retinal neurons in relation to capsid serotype and administration method. We also include our recent findings on an AAV serotype that AAV was specifically infected mouse cone photoreceptors when delivered by subretinal administration."

To determine whether PEPCK-M had a causative role in modulating the skeletal muscle growth response to Ractopamine, we used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to over-express Pck2 (AAV-Pck2) in murine skeletal muscle. A contralateral limb design was employed, such that each mouse served as its own control (injected with a GFP-only expressing AAV1, labelled AAV-GFP). Daily injections of Clenbuterol (1 mg/kg for 21 days) or vehicle control were also carried out to assess the effects of AAV-Pck2 overexpression on the anabolic response to a beta-adrenergic agonist. AAV-Pck2 overexpression in leg muscles of male C57BL6/J mice for 4 weeks (6-10 weeks of age) increased Pck2 mRNA (~100-fold), protein (not quantifiable) and enzyme activity (~3-fold). There was a trend (p = 0.0798) for AAV-Pck2 overexpression to reduce TA muscle weights, but there was no significant effect on muscle fibre diameters or myosin heavy chain isoform (MyHC) mRNA expression. When skeletal muscle growth was induced by daily administration of Clenbuterol (for 21 days), overexpression of AAV-Pck2 had no effect on the growth response, nor did it alter the expression of Phosphoserine Aminotransferase-1 (Psat1) or Asparagine Synthetase (Asns) mRNA or the Clenbuterol-induced decreases in MyHC IIa and IIx mRNA expression (p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0267 respectively). However AAV-Pck2 overexpression reduced TA muscle weights (p = 0.0434), particularly in the Control (vehicle treated) mice (p = 0.059 for AAV x Clenbuterol interaction) and increased the expression of Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (Sars) mRNA (p = 0.0477). Hence, contrary to the original hypothesis, AAV-Pck2 overexpression reduced TA muscle weights and did not mimic or alter the muscle hypertrophic effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist, Clenbuterol."

In the latter respect, the recent discovery of a non-structural AAV protein, termed assembly-activating protein (AAP), has shed new light on the processes involved in assembly of the viral capsid VP proteins into a capsid. Although many AAV serotypes require AAP for assembly, we have recently reported that AAV4, 5, and 11 are exceptions to this rule. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AAPs and assembled capsids of different serotypes localize to different subcellular compartments. This unexpected heterogeneity in the biological properties and functional roles of AAPs among different AAV serotypes underscores the importance of studies on AAPs derived from diverse serotypes. This manuscript details a straightforward dot blot assay for AAV quantitation and its application to assess AAP dependency and serotype specificity in capsid assembly. To demonstrate the utility of this dot blot assay, we set out to characterize capsid assembly and AAP dependency of Snake AAV, a previously uncharacterized reptile AAV, as well as AAV5 and AAV9, which have previously been shown to be AAP-independent and AAP-dependent serotypes, respectively. The assay revealed that Snake AAV capsid assembly requires Snake AAP and cannot be promoted by AAPs from AAV5 and AAV9. The assay also showed that, unlike many of the common serotype AAPs that promote heterologous capsid assembly by cross-complementation, Snake AAP does not promote assembly of AAV9 capsids. In addition, we show that the choice of nuclease significantly affects the readout of the dot blot assay, and thus, choosing an optimal enzyme is critical for successful assessment of AAV titers."

Concurrently, it raised questions about the role of AAP during production of recombinant vectors based on natural or molecularly engineered AAV capsids. Here, we show that AAP is indeed essential for generation of functional recombinant AAV2 vectors in both mammalian and insect cell-based vector production systems. Surprisingly, we observed that AAV2 capsid proteins VP1 to -3 are unstable in the absence of AAP2, likely due to rapid proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase of intracellular VP1 to -3 but neither triggered assembly of functional capsids nor promoted nuclear localization of the capsid proteins. Together, this underscores the crucial and unique role of AAP in the AAV life cycle, where it rapidly chaperones capsid assembly, thus preventing degradation of free capsid proteins. An expanded analysis comprising nine alternative AAV serotypes (1, 3 to 9, and rh10) showed that vector production always depends on the presence of AAP, with the exceptions of AAV4 and AAV5, which exhibited AAP-independent, albeit low-level, particle assembly. Interestingly, AAPs from all 10 serotypes could cross-complement AAP-depleted helper plasmids during vector production, despite there being distinct intracellular AAP localization patterns. These were most pronounced for AAP4 and AAP5, congruent with their inability to rescue an AAV2/AAP2 knockout. We conclude that AAP is key for assembly of genuine capsids from at least 10 different AAV serotypes, which has implications for vectors derived from wild-type or synthetic AAV capsids."

This is the first comprehensive Illumina-based RNA-Seq analysis of small RNAs expressed by AAV alone or upon co-infection with helper adenovirus or HSV. Several hotspots of AAV-specific small RNAs were detected mostly close to or within the AAV-ITR and apparently transcribed from the newly identified anti-p5 promoter. An additional small RNA hotspot was located downstream of the p40 promoter, from where transcription of non-coding RNAs associated with the inhibition of adenovirus replication were recently described. Parallel detection of known Ad and HSV miRNAs indirectly validated the newly identified small AAV RNA species. The predominant small RNAs were analyzed on Northern blots and by human argonaute protein-mediated co-immunoprecipitation. None of the small AAV RNAs showed characteristics of bona fide miRNAs, but characteristics of alternative RNA processing indicative of differentially regulated AAV promoter-associated small RNAs. Furthermore, the AAV-induced regulation of cellular miRNA levels was analyzed at different time points post infection. In contrast to other virus groups AAV infection had virtually no effect on the expression of cellular miRNA, which underscores the long-established concept that wild-type AAV infection is apathogenic.

Adeno-associated virus receptor (AAVR) (also named KIAA0319L) is an essential cellular receptor required for the transduction of vectors derived from multiple AAV serotypes, including the evolutionarily distant serotypes AAV2 and AAV5. Here, we further biochemically characterize the AAV-AAVR interaction and define the domains within the ectodomain of AAVR that facilitate this interaction. By using a virus overlay assay, it was previously shown that the major AAV2 binding protein in membrane preparations of human cells corresponds to a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. By establishing a purification procedure, performing further protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and utilizing mass spectrometry, we now show that this glycoprotein is identical to AAVR. While we find that AAVR is an N-linked glycosylated protein, this glycosylation is not a strict requirement for AAV2 binding or functional transduction. Using a combination of genetic complementation with deletion constructs and virus overlay assays with individual domains, we find that AAV2 functionally interacts predominantly with the second Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) repeat domain (PKD2) present in the ectodomain of AAVR. In contrast, AAV5 interacts primarily through the first, most membrane-distal, PKD domain (PKD1) of AAVR to promote transduction. Furthermore, other AAV serotypes, including AAV1 and -8, require a combination of PKD1 and PKD2 for optimal transduction. These results suggest that despite their shared dependence on AAVR as a critical entry receptor, different AAV serotypes have evolved distinctive interactions with the same receptor."

Here, we utilize a novel CRISPR screen to identify AAV restriction factors in a human hepatocyte cell line. The major hit from our gain-of-function screen is the apical polarity determinant Crumbs 3 (Crb3). Knockout (KO) of Crb3 enhances AAV transduction, while overexpression exerts the opposite effect. Further, Crb3 appears to restrict AAV transduction in a serotype- and cell type-specific manner. Particularly, for AAV serotype 9 and a rationally engineered AAV variant, we demonstrate that increased availability of galactosylated glycans on the surfaces of Crb3 KO cells, but not the universal AAV receptor, leads to increased capsid attachment and enhanced transduction. We postulate that Crb3 could serve as a key molecular determinant that restricts the availability of AAV glycan attachment factors on the cell surface by maintaining apical-basal polarity and tight junction integrity."

As part of AAV gene therapy program for treating mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III patients, the seroprevalence profiles of AAV1-9 and rh74 were investigated in MPS IIIA/IIIB patients and in healthy children. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for αAAV-IgG, significantly higher seroprevalence was observed for AAV1 and AAVrh74 in 2- to 7-year-old MPS III patients than in healthy controls. Seroprevalence for the majority of tested AAV serotypes appears to peak before 8 years of age in MPS III subjects, with the exception of increases in αAAV8 and αAAV9 Abs in 8- to 19-year-old MPS IIIA patients. In contrast, significant increases in seroprevalence were observed for virtually all tested AAV serotypes in 8- to 15-year-old healthy children compared to 2- to 7-year-olds. Co-prevalence and Ab level correlation results followed the previously established divergence-based clade positions of AAV1-9. Interestingly, the individuals positive for αAAVrh74-Abs showed the lowest co-prevalence with Abs for AAV1-9 (22-40%). However, all or nearly all (77-100%) of subjects who were seropositive for any of serotypes 1-9 were also positive for αAAVrh74-IgG. Notably, the majority (78%) of αAAV seropositive individuals were also Ab-positive for one to five of the tested AAV serotypes, mostly with low levels of αAAV-Abs (1:50-100), while a minority (22%) were seropositive for six or more AAV serotypes, mostly with high levels of αAAV-IgG for multiple serotypes. In general, the highest IgG levels were reactive to AAV2, AAV3, and AAVrh74. The data illustrate the complex seroprevalence profiles of AAV1-9 and rh74 in MPS patients and healthy children, indicating the potential association of AAV seroprevalence with age and disease conditions. The broad co-prevalence of Abs for different AAV serotypes reinforces the challenge of pre-existing αAAV-Abs for translating AAV gene therapy to clinical applications, regardless of the vector serotype."

In particular, exposure to the AAV capsid can generate an immune response of neutralizing antibodies. One approach to overcome this response is to map the AAV-specific neutralizing epitopes and rationally design an AAV capsid able to evade neutralization. To accomplish this, we isolated a monoclonal antibody against AAV9 following immunization of BALB/c mice and hybridoma screening. This antibody, PAV9.1, is specific for intact AAV9 capsids and has a high neutralizing titer of >1:160,000. We used cryo-electron microscopy to reconstruct PAV9.1 in complex with AAV9. We then mapped its epitope to the 3-fold axis of symmetry on the capsid, specifically to residues 496-NNN-498 and 588-QAQAQT-592. Capsid mutagenesis demonstrated that even a single amino acid substitution within this epitope markedly reduced binding and neutralization by PAV9.1. In addition, "

Recently, the authors' group has specifically studied AAP's relevance during production of AAV gene therapy vectors in mammalian or insect cells, and AAP was found to be essential for capsid protein stabilization and generation of functional vector particles. Here, the lingering question is additionally addressed of whether molecular AAV evolution via DNA family shuffling of viral capsid genes would perturb AAP functionality due to concurrent and inadvertent recombination of the AAP open reading frame. To this end, a battery of complementary experiments was conducted in which: (1) the ability of chimeric AAP from AAVDJ, a hybrid of serotypes 2, 8, and 9, was tested to rescue AAP knockouts in the three parental serotypes; (2) the functionality of 60 chimeric AAPs extracted from five shuffled, unselected capsid libraries was measured; (3) whether production of different shuffled libraries, 10 wild-type serotypes or 25 individual chimeric capsids, can be enhanced by overexpression of AAP cocktails was assessed; and (4) the activity of 12 chimeric AAPs isolated from a shuffled library that was iteratively selected in vivo in mouse livers was studied. Collectively, the data demonstrate a remarkable tolerance of AAP for recombination via DNA family shuffling, evidenced by the findings that (1) all chimeric AAPs studied here retained at least partial activity, even in cases where the cognate hybrid capsid may be non-functional, and that (2) ectopic AAP overexpression did not enhance production of shuffled AAV chimeras or libraries, implying that the inherently encoded hybrid AAP variants are sufficiently active. Together, this work provides compelling evidence that AAP is not rate limiting during AAV capsid shuffling and thereby relieves a major concern in the field of AAV vector evolution."

To investigate this hypothesis, rAAV serotypes (rAAV1, rAAV2, rAAV8, and rAAV9) were exposed to diluents and various environmental conditions, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 0.06% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), tap water, and 70% ethanol (EtOH). The changes of the infectivity of the treated samples were assessed by transduction in HeLaRC32 cells as a criterion of stability. The infectivity between recombinant and wild-type AAV (wtAAV2) was also analyzed. The activity of all rAAV serotypes was weakened by UV irradiation and NaOH and NaClO exposure. Treatment for 10 days with tap water or 70% EtOH did not appreciably inactivate rAAV1, rAAV8, and rAAV9, but did affect the activity of rAAV2. Furthermore, the infectivity of rAAV2 did not surpass wtAAV2 infectivity. The results will be important for clinical studies for gene therapy using rAAV."

However, challenges to this system remain. In viral gene therapy, the surface of the capsid is an important determinant of tissue tropism, impacts gene transfer efficiency, and is targeted by the human immune system. Preexisting immunity is a significant challenge to this approach, and the ability to visualize areas of antibody binding (""footprints"") can inform efforts to improve the efficacy of viral vectors. Atomic resolution, smaller proteins, and asymmetric structures are the goals to attain in cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction (cryo-EM) as of late. The versatility of the technique and the ability to vitrify a wide range of heterogeneous molecules in solution allow structural biologists to characterize a variety of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions at lower resolution. Cryo-EM has served as an important means to study key surface areas of the AAV gene delivery vehicle-specifically, those involved with binding neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) [2-4]. This method offers a unique opportunity for visualizing antibody binding ""hotspots"" on the surface of these and other viral vectors. When combined with mutagenesis, one can eliminate these hotspots to create viral vectors with the ability to avoid preexisting host immune recognition during gene delivery and genetic defect correction in disease treatment. Here, we discuss the use of structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution to create ""stealth"" AAV vectors with modified surface amino acid sequences that allow NAb avoidance while maintaining natural capsid functions or gaining desired novel tropisms."

These vectors are exhibiting low-immunogenicity across the clinical trials in addition to showing evidence of efficacy, making it clear they are the current standard vector for any potential gene therapy treatment. However, AAV vectors do have a limitation in their packaging capacity, being capable of holding no more than ~5kb of DNA and in a therapeutic transgene scenario, this length of DNA would need to include genetic control elements in addition to the gene coding sequence (CDS) of interest. Given that numerous diseases are caused by mutations in genes with a CDS exceeding 3.5kb, this makes packaging into a single AAV capsid not possible for larger genes. Due to this problem, yet with the desire to use AAV vectors, research groups have adapted the standard AAV gene therapy approach to enable delivery of such large genes to target cells using dual AAV vector systems. Here we review the AAV dual vector strategies currently employed and highlight the virtues and drawbacks of each method plus the likelihood of success with such approaches."

All of them detected viral genomes, but identification of mRNA transduction was not consistent; clinical outcomes in Phase II studies were also inconsistent. The lack of a positive outcome has been attributed to a less-than-efficient viral infection by AAV2, a weak transgene promoter and the host immune response to the vector. Areas covered: Herein, the authors focus on AAV gene therapy for CF, evaluating past experience with this approach and identifying ways forward, based on the progress that has already been made in identifying and overcoming the limitations of AAV gene therapy. Expert opinion: Such progress makes it clear that this is an opportune time to push forward toward the development of a gene therapy for CF. Drugs to treat the basic defect in CF represent a remarkable advance but cannot treat a significant cohort of patients with rare mutations.

RIS-Ad functions independently of Rep protein expression. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of adenoviral replication by RIS-Ad requires an active AAV p40 promoter and the 5' half of the intron. In addition, Ad inhibition is critically dependent on the integrity of the p40 transcription start site (TSS) leading to short p40-associated transcripts. These do not give rise to effector molecules capable of inhibiting adenoviral replication intrans, like small polypeptides or microRNAs. Our data point to an inhibitory mechanism in which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses directly downstream of the p40 promoter, leading to interference of the stalled Pol II transcription complex with the adenoviral replication machinery. Whereas inhibition by RIS-Ad is mediated exclusively incis, it can be overcome by providing a replication-competent adenoviral genome intrans Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RIS-Ad is not limited to AAV-2 but could also be shown for the corresponding regions of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-5.

Here, we apply Illumina-based RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the entire AAV2 transcriptome in the absence or presence of Ad.

In this report, we have characterized the defect in 6 additional capsid mutants located in a region ∼30 Å in diameter on the surface of the AAV type 2 (AAV2) capsid near the 2-fold interface. These mutants, which are highly conserved among primate serotypes, displayed a severe defect (3 to 6 logs) in infectivity. All of the mutants accumulated significant levels of uncoated DNA in the nucleus, but none of the mutants were able to accumulate significant amounts of genomic mRNA postinfection. In addition, wild-type (wt) capsids that were bound to the conformational antibody A20, which is known to bind the capsid surface in the region of the mutants, were also defective for transcription. In all cases, the mutant virus particles, as well as the antibody-bound wild-type capsids, were able to enter the cell, travel to the nucleus, uncoat, and synthesize a second strand but were unable to transcribe their genomes. Taken together, the phenotype of these mutants provides compelling evidence that the AAV capsid plays a role in the transcription of its genome, and the mutants map this functional region on the surface of the capsid near the 2-fold interface. This appears to be the first example of a viral structural protein that is also involved in the transcription of the viral genome that it delivers to the nucleus."

When a low dose of AAV9 was injected into mice treated with dexamethasone, global transduction and vector biodistribution were not significantly different in most tissues, other than the liver and the heart, when compared to control mice.

The study on the kinetics of AAV virus clearance demonstrated that dexamethasone slowed down the clearance of AAV9 in the blood after systemic application. The mechanism study showed that dexamethasone inhibited the enhancement of AAV9 vascular permeability mediated by serum proteins. The findings indicate that dexamethasone is able to inhibit the vascular permeability of AAV and compromise the therapeutic effect after systemic administration of AAV vector.

Data on such post-translational modifications in the capsid of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotypes (AAV1-rh10) is limited. We have employed liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis to characterize post-translational modifications in AAV1-rh10 capsid protein. Our analysis revealed a total of 52 post-translational modifications in AAV2-AAVrh10 capsids, including ubiquitination (17%), glycosylation (36%), phosphorylation (21%), SUMOylation (13%) and acetylation (11%). While AAV1 had no detectable post-translational modification, at least four AAV serotypes had >7 post-translational modifications in their capsid protein. About 82% of these post-translational modifications are novel. A limited validation of AAV2 capsids by MALDI-TOF and western blot analysis demonstrated minimal glycosylation and ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids. To further validate this, we disrupted a glycosylation site identified in AAV2 capsid (AAV2-N253Q), which severely compromised its packaging efficiency (~ 100-fold vs. AAV2 wild-type vectors). In order to confirm other post-translational modifications detected such as SUMOylation, mutagenesis of a SUMOylation site(K258Q) in AAV2 was performed. This mutant vector demonstrated reduced levels of SUMO-1/2/3 proteins and negligible transduction, 2 weeks after ocular gene transfer. Our study underscores the heterogeneity of post-translational modifications in AAV vectors. The data presented here, should facilitate further studies to understand the biological relevance of post-translational modifications in AAV life cycle and the development of novel bioengineered AAV vectors for gene therapy applications.

To this end, we have developed a protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that responds to elevated extracellular protease activity commonly found in diseased tissue microenvironments. The AAV9-based provector is initially inactive, but then it can be switched on by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9. Cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction reveal that the provector capsid is structurally similar to that of AAV9, with a flexible peptide insertion at the top of the 3-fold protrusions. In an in vivo model of myocardial infarction (MI), the provector is able to deliver transgenes site specifically to high-MMP-activity regions of the damaged heart, with concomitant decreased delivery to many off-target organs, including the liver.

To do this, any serotype dependent steps need to be removed from the process. The harvest and initial capture steps that can satisfy all of the needs of a platform AAV process is the use of low pH and Triton in the harvest, followed by filtration and cation exchange chromatography (CEX) for initial capture.

It has been demonstrated that serum proteins are able to directly interact with AAV virions to enhance liver transduction. In this study, we investigate whether the serum proteins have the potential to increase the capacity of AAV to diffuse through the endothelial cells and deliver the transgene into the whole body. First, we found that the direct interaction of serum with AAV9 virions increased the epithelial cell permeability of AAV9 in vitro. Several serum proteins with a potential effect on AAV vascular permeability have been identified from mass spectrometry analysis, including fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), platelet factor 4, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and plasminogen. The incubation of these serum proteins with AAV9 enhanced the global transduction in mice after a systemic administration. To apply these findings in clinical practice, we demonstrated that the clinical product cryoprecipitate (mainly containing fibrinogen and vWF) augmented AAV9 global transduction. The mechanism study revealed that cryoprecipitate slowed down the clearance of AAV9 vectors in the blood so that the AAV9 vectors had sufficient time to travel to the peripheral organs. In summary, the results from this study suggests that serum proteins interact with AAV virions and enhance the AAV9 vascular permeability for global transduction, and, more importantly, cryoprecipitate can be immediately applied for clinical patients who need the systemic administration of AAV vectors for global transduction."

Here, we have established a method for inducing foreign gene expression in mouse taste cells in vivo by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. First, using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter, we screened 6 AAV serotypes along with a recombinant lentivirus vector for their ability to transduce taste cells. One week after viral injection into the submucosa of the tongue, EGFP expression in fungiform taste cells was observed only in animals injected with AAV-DJ, a synthetic serotype. Next, time course of AAV-DJ-mediated EGFP expression in fungiform taste cells was evaluated. Intragemmal EGFP signals appeared after a delay, rapidly increased until 7 days postinjection, and gradually decreased over the next few weeks probably because of the cell turnover. Finally, the taste cell types susceptible to AAV-DJ transduction were characterized. EGFP expression was observed in PLCβ2-immunoreactive type II and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-immunoreactive type III taste cells as well as in cells immunonegative for both PLCβ2 and AADC, demonstrating that AAV-DJ does not discriminate functional taste cell types. In conclusion, the method established in this study will be a promising tool to study the mechanism of taste."

A major goal is to enhance the transduction efficiency of vectors in order to achieve therapeutic levels of gene expression at a vector dose that is below the immunological response threshold. In an attempt to identify novel compounds that enhance rAAV transduction, we performed two high-throughput screens comprising 2,396 compounds. We identified 13 compounds that were capable of enhancing transduction, of which 12 demonstrated vector-specific effects and 1 could also enhance vector-independent transgene expression. Many of these compounds had similar properties and could be categorized into five groups: epipodophyllotoxins (group 1), inducers of DNA damage (group 2), effectors of epigenetic modification (group 3), anthracyclines (group 4), and proteasome inhibitors (group 5). We optimized dosing for the identified compounds in several immortalized human cell lines as well as normal diploid cells. We found that the group 1 epipodophyllotoxins (teniposide and etoposide) consistently produced the greatest transduction enhancement. We also explored transduction enhancement among single-stranded, self-complementary, and fragment vectors and found that the compounds could impact fragmented rAAV2 transduction to an even greater extent than single-stranded vectors. In vivo analysis of rAAV2 and all of the clinically relevant compounds revealed that, consistent with our in vitro results, teniposide exhibited the greatest level of transduction enhancement. Finally, we explored the capability of teniposide to enhance transduction of fragment vectors in vivo using an AAV8 capsid that is known to exhibit robust liver tropism. Consistent with our in vitro results, teniposide coadministration greatly enhanced fragmented rAAV8 transduction at 48 h and 8 days. This study provides a foundation based on the rAAV small-molecule screen methodology, which is ideally used for more-diverse libraries of compounds that can be tested for potentiating rAAV transduction."

This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after propagating a field isolate of the DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts.

The genomic distribution of the structural and non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other Dependoparvovirus family members.

By modulating the ratio of subunits in the mosaic capsid, properties of the activatable peptide display function can be optimized. Interestingly, the truncated subunits can form homomeric capsids not observed in nature, but at the price of losing the ability to carry out activatable peptide display. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of capsid mosaicism when activatable peptide display is desired and help explain why the wild-type AAV capsid exists as a mosaic of different subunits.

However, the installation of such capsid modifications currently faces two major challenges: (1) The complex and delicate capsid proteins often do not tolerate large modifications, and (2) capsid proteins are composed of the 20 canonical amino acids, precluding site-specific chemical modification of the virus. Here, we describe a technology for generating adeno-associated virus (AAV) while incorporating an unnatural amino acid (UAA) into specific sites of the virus capsid. Incorporation of this UAA is generally tolerated well, presumably due to its small structural footprint. The resulting virus can be precisely functionalized at the site of UAA incorporation using chemoselective conjugation strategies targeted toward the azido side chain of this UAA. This technology provides a powerful way to modify AAV with unprecedented precision to both probe and engineer its entry process."

Such model systems are powerful tools to study the virus biology and in particular for the identification and characterization of host factors playing a role in the viral infection cycle. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are heavily studied due to their use as gene delivery vectors. AAV relies on other helper viruses for successful replication and on host factors for several aspects of the viral life cycle. However the role of host and helper viral factors is only partially known. Production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors for gene delivery applications depends on knowledge of AAV biology and the limited understanding of host and helper viral factors may be precluding efficient production, particularly in heterologous systems. Model systems in simpler eukaryotes like the yeast S. cerevisiae would be useful tools to identify and study the role of host factors in AAV biology. Here we show that expression of AAV2 viral proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, AAP, Rep78, Rep52 and an ITR-flanked DNA in yeast leads to capsid formation, DNA replication and encapsidation, resulting in formation of infectious particles. Many of the AAV characteristics observed in yeast resemble those in other systems, making it a suitable model system. Future findings in the yeast system could be translatable to other AAV host systems and aid in more efficient production of rAAV vectors."

To overcome this limitation and to generate AAV vectors that persist episomally in dividing cells, AAV vector genomes were equipped with a scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR). After a mild antibiotic selection, cells transduced with AAV-S/MAR established colonies that maintained long-term transgene expression (>50 population doublings) from replicating AAV vector episomes in the absence of further selection. Unexpectedly, with a lesser but still significant efficiency, the control vector (AAV-ΔS/MAR), a standard single-stranded AAV vector, also established stable transgene-expressing colonies, most of which were maintained as replicating episomes rather than integrated vector genomes. Thus, based on the result in HeLa cells, it is concluded that AAV vector genomes per se possess the ability to establish episomal maintenance in proliferating cells, a feature that can be enhanced by incorporation of a foreign genomic element such as an S/MAR element."

Exploration of effective strategies to enhance AAV transduction and escape from Nab activity is still imperative. Previous studies have shown the compatibility of capsids from AAV serotypes and homology of recognition sites of AAV Nab located on different capsid subunits from one virion. In this study, we co-transfected AAV2 and AAV8 helper plasmids at different ratios (3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) to assemble haploid capsids and study both their transduction efficiency and Nab escape activity. After muscular injection, all of the haploid viruses induced higher transduction than their parental AAV vectors (2- to 9-fold over AAV2), with the highest of these being the haploid vector AAV2/8 3:1. After systemic administration, a 4-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with haploid AAV2/8 1:3 than that with AAV8 alone. We then packaged the therapeutic factor IX cassette into haploid AAV2/8 1:3 capsids and injected them into FIX knockout mice via the tail vein. Higher FIX expression and improved phenotypic correction were achieved with the haploid AAV2/8 1:3 virus vector when compared to that of AAV8. Additionally, the haploid virus AAV2/8 1:3 was able to escape AAV2 neutralization and did not increase capsid antigen presentation capacity when compared to AAV8. To improve the Nab evasion ability of the haploid virus, we produced the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 by co-transfecting AAV2, AAV8 and AAV9 helper plasmids at a ratio of 1:1:1. After systemic administration, a 2-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 than that with AAV8. Nab analysis demonstrated that the triploid AAV2/8/9 vector was able to escape Nab activity from mouse sera immunized with parental serotypes. These results indicate that polyploid viruses might potentially acquire advantages from parental serotypes for enhancement of AAV transduction and evasion of Nab recognition without increasing capsid antigen presentation in target cells. Polyploid AAV vectors can be generated from any AAV serotype, whether natural, rational, library derived or a combination thereof, providing a novel strategy that should be explored in future clinical trials in patients with neutralizing antibodies."

To address this discrepancy humanized mouse models have recently been used to predict AAV transduction efficiency for human hepatocytes. In this study we evaluated AAV vector transduction from several serotypes in human liver hepatocytes xenografted into chimeric mice. After systemic administration of AAV vectors encoding a GFP transgene in humanized mice, the liver was harvested for either immunohistochemistry staining or flow cytometry assay for AAV human hepatocyte transduction analysis. We observed that AAV7 consistently transduced human hepatocytes more efficiently than other serotypes in both immunohistochemistry assay and flow cytometry analysis. To better assess the future application of AAV7 for systemic administration in the treatment of hemophilia or other liver diseases, we analyzed the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV7 in sera from healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia. In the general population, the prevalence of NAbs to AAV7 was lower than that of AAV2 or AAV3B. However, a higher prevalence of AAV7 NAbs was found in patients with hemophilia. In summary, results from this study suggest that AAV7 vectors should be considered as an effective vehicle for human liver targeting in future clinical trials."

In the absence of the helper virus, AAV can persist in an episomal or integrated form. Previous studies have analyzed the DNA damage response (DDR) induced upon AAV replication to understand how it controls AAV replication. In particular, it was shown that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, a major player of the DDR induced by double-stranded DNA breaks and stalled replication forks, could negatively regulate AdV and AAV replication during coinfection. In contrast, MRN favors HSV-1 replication and is recruited to AAV replication compartments that are induced in the presence of HSV-1. In this study, we examined the role of MRN during AAV replication induced by HSV-1. Our results indicated that knockdown of MRN significantly reduced AAV DNA replication after coinfection with wild-type (wt) HSV-1 or HSV-1 with the polymerase deleted. This effect was specific to wt AAV, since it did not occur with recombinant AAV vectors. Positive regulation of AAV replication by MRN was dependent on its DNA tethering activity but did not require its nuclease activities. Importantly, knockdown of MRN also negatively regulated AAV integration within the human AAVS1 site, both in the presence and in the absence of HSV-1. Altogether, this work identifies a new function of MRN during integration of the AAV genome and demonstrates that this DNA repair complex positively regulates AAV replication in the presence of HSV-1."

The integration site known as AAVS1 is located in chromosome 19 and contains multiple GCTC repeats that are recognized by the AAV non-structural Rep proteins. These proteins are multifunctional, with an N-terminal origin-binding domain (OBD) and a helicase domain joined together by a short linker. As a first step to understand the process of site-specific integration, we proceeded to characterize the recognition and assembly of Rep68 onto the AAVS1 site. We first determined the x-ray structure of AAV-2 Rep68 OBD in complex with the AAVS1 DNA site. Specificity is achieved through the interaction of a glycine-rich loop that binds the major groove and an α-helix that interacts with a downstream minor groove on the same face of the DNA. Although the structure shows a complex with three OBD molecules bound to the AAVS1 site, we show by using analytical centrifugation and electron microscopy that the full-length Rep68 forms a heptameric complex. Moreover, we determined that a minimum of two direct repeats is required to form a stable complex and to melt DNA. Finally, we show that although the individual domains bind DNA poorly, complex assembly requires oligomerization and cooperation between its OBD, helicase, and the linker domains. "

They have been successfully used in clinical trials to treat hereditary diseases such as haemophilia B (ref. 2), and have been approved for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe. Considerable efforts have been made to engineer AAV variants with novel and biomedically valuable cell tropisms to allow efficacious systemic administration, yet basic aspects of AAV cellular entry are still poorly understood. In particular, the protein receptor(s) required for AAV entry after cell attachment remains unknown. Here we use an unbiased genetic screen to identify proteins essential for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) infection in a haploid human cell line. The most significantly enriched gene of the screen encodes a previously uncharacterized type I transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L (denoted hereafter as AAV receptor (AAVR)). We characterize AAVR as a protein capable of rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane and trafficking to the trans-Golgi network. We show that AAVR directly binds to AAV2 particles, and that anti-AAVR antibodies efficiently block AAV2 infection. Moreover, genetic ablation of AAVR renders a wide range of mammalian cell types highly resistant to AAV2 infection. Notably, AAVR serves as a critical host factor for all tested AAV serotypes. The importance of AAVR for in vivo gene delivery is further highlighted by the robust resistance of Aavr(-/-) (also known as Au040320(-/-) and Kiaa0319l(-/-)) mice to AAV infection. Collectively, our data indicate that AAVR is a universal receptor involved in AAV infection. "

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently a leader for direct in vivo gene therapy. To date, AAV is safe in patients, with clinical benefit in trials to treat blindness, hemophilia, and a lipid disorder, with many more trials underway. Despite this remarkable progress, barriers exist for AAV vectors to be effective gene transfer vehicles in all organ/cell targets, as well as patient subpopulations. Extracellular vesicles (EVs, e.g., exosomes, microvesicles) are natural lipid particles released by many cell types. They have been reported to mediate cell to cell communication via transferred contents including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. These properties of EV attracted our attention to help solve certain gene transfer issues encountered by AAV vectors. We made the initial discovery that a subpopulation of AAV vectors isolated from media directly interacted with EVs [referred to as exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV)]. In following reports, we have demonstrated that exo-AAV has advantages over the conventional AAV vector in areas such as anti-AAV antibody evasion and transduction of cells of the eye and cochlea in preclinical models. The work of others using EVs as therapeutics as well as our continued development of the exo-AAV platform may advance the field towards useful clinical applications.

The present study evaluated whether in vivo satellite glial cell (SGC) transduction in the DRG can be enhanced by the SGC-specific GFAP promoter and by using shH10 and shH19, which are engineered capsid variants with Müller glia-prone transduction. Titer-matched AAV6 (as control), AAVshH10, and AAVshH19, all encoding the EGFP driven by the constitutively active CMV promoter, as well as AAV6-EGFP and AAVshH10-EGFP driven by a GFAP promoter (AAV6-GFAP-EGFP and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP), were injected into DRG of adult male rats. Neurotropism of gene expression was determined and compared by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that injection of AAV6- and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP induces robust EGFP expression selectively in SGCs, whereas injection of either AAVshH10-CMV-EGFP or AAVshH19-CMV-EGFP into DRG resulted in a similar in vivo transduction profile to AAV6-CMV-EGFP, all showing efficient transduction of sensory neurons without significant transduction of glial cell populations. Coinjection of AAV6-CMV-mCherry and AAV6-GFAP-EGFP induces transgene expression in neurons and SGCs separately. This report, together with our prior studies, demonstrates that the GFAP promoter rather than capsid tropism determines selective gene expression in SGCs following intraganglionic AAV delivery in adult rats. A dual AAV system, one with GFAP promoter and the other with CMV promoter, can efficiently express transgenes selectively in neurons versus SGCs."

We recently developed a synthetic protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that transduces cells preferentially in environments rich in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are elevated in a variety of diseases, including various cancers and heart diseases. The provector displays peptide locks made up of MMP recognition sites flanking an inactivating sequence (IS) composed of four aspartic acid residues (D4). When present, the IS prevents AAV from binding cell receptors and no transduction occurs (OFF state). High levels of MMPs cleave the recognition sequences and release the IS from the capsid surface, restoring cell receptor binding (ON state). The AAV9 provector prototype is not optimal as it displays baseline OFF transduction at 5-10% of that of the wild-type capsid, which can lead to off-target delivery. We hypothesized that changes to the IS may decrease OFF state transduction. We created a provector panel with IS of lengths 0 (D0) to 10 (D10) aspartic acid residues and characterized this panel in vitro. Notably, we find that the D10 provector has an OFF transduction of less than 1% of wild-type capsid and an ON/OFF transduction ratio of 27, the best outcome achieved for any provector thus far. In summary, our results enable us to define new design rules for the provector platform, specifically that (1) the IS is necessary for provector locking and (2) increasing the number of aspartic acid residues in this sequence improves locking."

This study revealed that AAP1 to -12 are all localized in the nucleus with serotype-specific differential patterns of nucleolar association; AAPs and assembled capsids do not necessarily colocalize; AAPs are promiscuous in promoting capsid assembly of other serotypes, with the exception of AAP4, -5, -11, and -12; assembled AAV5, -8, and -9 capsids are excluded from the nucleolus, in contrast to the nucleolar enrichment of assembled AAV2 capsids; and, surprisingly, AAV4, -5, and -11 capsids are not dependent on AAP for assembly.

Although many AAV serotypes require AAP for assembly, we have recently reported that AAV4, 5, and 11 are exceptions to this rule. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AAPs and assembled capsids of different serotypes localize to different subcellular compartments. This unexpected heterogeneity in the biological properties and functional roles of AAPs among different AAV serotypes underscores the importance of studies on AAPs derived from diverse serotypes. This manuscript details a straightforward dot blot assay for AAV quantitation and its application to assess AAP dependency and serotype specificity in capsid assembly. To demonstrate the utility of this dot blot assay, we set out to characterize capsid assembly and AAP dependency of Snake AAV, a previously uncharacterized reptile AAV, as well as AAV5 and AAV9, which have previously been shown to be AAP-independent and AAP-dependent serotypes, respectively. The assay revealed that Snake AAV capsid assembly requires Snake AAP and cannot be promoted by AAPs from AAV5 and AAV9. The assay also showed that, unlike many of the common serotype AAPs that promote heterologous capsid assembly by cross-complementation, Snake AAP does not promote assembly of AAV9 capsids. In addition, we show that the choice of nuclease significantly affects the readout of the dot blot assay, and thus, choosing an optimal enzyme is critical for successful assessment of AAV titers."

Concurrently, it raised questions about the role of AAP during production of recombinant vectors based on natural or molecularly engineered AAV capsids. Here, we show that AAP is indeed essential for generation of functional recombinant AAV2 vectors in both mammalian and insect cell-based vector production systems. Surprisingly, we observed that AAV2 capsid proteins VP1 to -3 are unstable in the absence of AAP2, likely due to rapid proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase of intracellular VP1 to -3 but neither triggered assembly of functional capsids nor promoted nuclear localization of the capsid proteins. Together, this underscores the crucial and unique role of AAP in the AAV life cycle, where it rapidly chaperones capsid assembly, thus preventing degradation of free capsid proteins. An expanded analysis comprising nine alternative AAV serotypes (1, 3 to 9, and rh10) showed that vector production always depends on the presence of AAP, with the exceptions of AAV4 and AAV5, which exhibited AAP-independent, albeit low-level, particle assembly. Interestingly, AAPs from all 10 serotypes could cross-complement AAP-depleted helper plasmids during vector production, despite there being distinct intracellular AAP localization patterns. These were most pronounced for AAP4 and AAP5, congruent with their inability to rescue an AAV2/AAP2 knockout. We conclude that AAP is key for assembly of genuine capsids from at least 10 different AAV serotypes, which has implications for vectors derived from wild-type or synthetic AAV capsids."

This is the first comprehensive Illumina-based RNA-Seq analysis of small RNAs expressed by AAV alone or upon co-infection with helper adenovirus or HSV. Several hotspots of AAV-specific small RNAs were detected mostly close to or within the AAV-ITR and apparently transcribed from the newly identified anti-p5 promoter. An additional small RNA hotspot was located downstream of the p40 promoter, from where transcription of non-coding RNAs associated with the inhibition of adenovirus replication were recently described. Parallel detection of known Ad and HSV miRNAs indirectly validated the newly identified small AAV RNA species. The predominant small RNAs were analyzed on Northern blots and by human argonaute protein-mediated co-immunoprecipitation. None of the small AAV RNAs showed characteristics of bona fide miRNAs, but characteristics of alternative RNA processing indicative of differentially regulated AAV promoter-associated small RNAs. Furthermore, the AAV-induced regulation of cellular miRNA levels was analyzed at different time points post infection. In contrast to other virus groups AAV infection had virtually no effect on the expression of cellular miRNA, which underscores the long-established concept that wild-type AAV infection is apathogenic.

Adeno-associated virus receptor (AAVR) (also named KIAA0319L) is an essential cellular receptor required for the transduction of vectors derived from multiple AAV serotypes, including the evolutionarily distant serotypes AAV2 and AAV5. Here, we further biochemically characterize the AAV-AAVR interaction and define the domains within the ectodomain of AAVR that facilitate this interaction. By using a virus overlay assay, it was previously shown that the major AAV2 binding protein in membrane preparations of human cells corresponds to a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. By establishing a purification procedure, performing further protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and utilizing mass spectrometry, we now show that this glycoprotein is identical to AAVR. While we find that AAVR is an N-linked glycosylated protein, this glycosylation is not a strict requirement for AAV2 binding or functional transduction. Using a combination of genetic complementation with deletion constructs and virus overlay assays with individual domains, we find that AAV2 functionally interacts predominantly with the second Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) repeat domain (PKD2) present in the ectodomain of AAVR. In contrast, AAV5 interacts primarily through the first, most membrane-distal, PKD domain (PKD1) of AAVR to promote transduction. Furthermore, other AAV serotypes, including AAV1 and -8, require a combination of PKD1 and PKD2 for optimal transduction. These results suggest that despite their shared dependence on AAVR as a critical entry receptor, different AAV serotypes have evolved distinctive interactions with the same receptor."

Here, we utilize a novel CRISPR screen to identify AAV restriction factors in a human hepatocyte cell line. The major hit from our gain-of-function screen is the apical polarity determinant Crumbs 3 (Crb3). Knockout (KO) of Crb3 enhances AAV transduction, while overexpression exerts the opposite effect. Further, Crb3 appears to restrict AAV transduction in a serotype- and cell type-specific manner. Particularly, for AAV serotype 9 and a rationally engineered AAV variant, we demonstrate that increased availability of galactosylated glycans on the surfaces of Crb3 KO cells, but not the universal AAV receptor, leads to increased capsid attachment and enhanced transduction. We postulate that Crb3 could serve as a key molecular determinant that restricts the availability of AAV glycan attachment factors on the cell surface by maintaining apical-basal polarity and tight junction integrity."

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for αAAV-IgG, significantly higher seroprevalence was observed for AAV1 and AAVrh74 in 2- to 7-year-old MPS III patients than in healthy controls.

To accomplish this, we isolated a monoclonal antibody against AAV9 following immunization of BALB/c mice and hybridoma screening. This antibody, PAV9.1, is specific for intact AAV9 capsids and has a high neutralizing titer of >1:160,000. We used cryo-electron microscopy to reconstruct PAV9.1 in complex with AAV9. We then mapped its epitope to the 3-fold axis of symmetry on the capsid, specifically to residues 496-NNN-498 and 588-QAQAQT-592.

Recently, the authors' group has specifically studied AAP's relevance during production of AAV gene therapy vectors in mammalian or insect cells, and AAP was found to be essential for capsid protein stabilization and generation of functional vector particles. Here, the lingering question is additionally addressed of whether molecular AAV evolution via DNA family shuffling of viral capsid genes would perturb AAP functionality due to concurrent and inadvertent recombination of the AAP open reading frame. To this end, a battery of complementary experiments was conducted in which: (1) the ability of chimeric AAP from AAVDJ, a hybrid of serotypes 2, 8, and 9, was tested to rescue AAP knockouts in the three parental serotypes; (2) the functionality of 60 chimeric AAPs extracted from five shuffled, unselected capsid libraries was measured; (3) whether production of different shuffled libraries, 10 wild-type serotypes or 25 individual chimeric capsids, can be enhanced by overexpression of AAP cocktails was assessed; and (4) the activity of 12 chimeric AAPs isolated from a shuffled library that was iteratively selected in vivo in mouse livers was studied. Collectively, the data demonstrate a remarkable tolerance of AAP for recombination via DNA family shuffling, evidenced by the findings that (1) all chimeric AAPs studied here retained at least partial activity, even in cases where the cognate hybrid capsid may be non-functional, and that (2) ectopic AAP overexpression did not enhance production of shuffled AAV chimeras or libraries, implying that the inherently encoded hybrid AAP variants are sufficiently active. Together, this work provides compelling evidence that AAP is not rate limiting during AAV capsid shuffling and thereby relieves a major concern in the field of AAV vector evolution."

In viral gene therapy, the surface of the capsid is an important determinant of tissue tropism, impacts gene transfer efficiency, and is targeted by the human immune system. Preexisting immunity is a significant challenge to this approach, and the ability to visualize areas of antibody binding (""footprints"") can inform efforts to improve the efficacy of viral vectors. Atomic resolution, smaller proteins, and asymmetric structures are the goals to attain in cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction (cryo-EM) as of late. The versatility of the technique and the ability to vitrify a wide range of heterogeneous molecules in solution allow structural biologists to characterize a variety of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions at lower resolution. Cryo-EM has served as an important means to study key surface areas of the AAV gene delivery vehicle-specifically, those involved with binding neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) [2-4]. This method offers a unique opportunity for visualizing antibody binding ""hotspots"" on the surface of these and other viral vectors. When combined with mutagenesis, one can eliminate these hotspots to create viral vectors with the ability to avoid preexisting host immune recognition during gene delivery and genetic defect correction in disease treatment.

These do not give rise to effector molecules capable of inhibiting adenoviral replication intrans, like small polypeptides or microRNAs. Our data point to an inhibitory mechanism in which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses directly downstream of the p40 promoter, leading to interference of the stalled Pol II transcription complex with the adenoviral replication machinery. Whereas inhibition by RIS-Ad is mediated exclusively incis, it can be overcome by providing a replication-competent adenoviral genome intrans Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RIS-Ad is not limited to AAV-2 but could also be shown for the corresponding regions of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-5. These findings have important implications for the future generation of Ad5/AAV hybrid vectors."

The ability to generate recombinant AAV particles lacking any viral genes and containing DNA sequences of interest for various therapeutic applications has thus far proven to be one of the safest strategies for gene therapies.

The shift from latent to Ad-dependent AAV replication is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level. The current AAV transcription map displays highly expressed transcripts as found upon coinfection with Ad. So far, AAV transcripts have only been characterized on the plus strand of the AAV single-stranded DNA genome. The AAV minus strand is assumed not to be transcribed. Here, we apply Illumina-based RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the entire AAV2 transcriptome in the absence or presence of Ad. We find known and identify novel AAV transcripts, including additional splice variants, the most abundant of which leads to expression of a novel 18-kDa Rep/VP fusion protein. Furthermore, we identify for the first time transcription on the AAV minus strand with clustered reads upstream of the p5 promoter, confirmed by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RNase protection assays. The p5 promoter displays considerable activity in both directions, a finding indicative of divergent transcription. Upon infection with AAV alone, low-level transcription of both AAV strands is detectable and is strongly stimulated upon coinfection with Ad."

In this report, we have characterized the defect in 6 additional capsid mutants located in a region ∼30 Å in diameter on the surface of the AAV type 2 (AAV2) capsid near the 2-fold interface. These mutants, which are highly conserved among primate serotypes, displayed a severe defect (3 to 6 logs) in infectivity. All of the mutants accumulated significant levels of uncoated DNA in the nucleus, but none of the mutants were able to accumulate significant amounts of genomic mRNA postinfection. In addition, wild-type (wt) capsids that were bound to the conformational antibody A20, which is known to bind the capsid surface in the region of the mutants, were also defective for transcription. In all cases, the mutant virus particles, as well as the antibody-bound wild-type capsids, were able to enter the cell, travel to the nucleus, uncoat, and synthesize a second strand but were unable to transcribe their genomes. Taken together, the phenotype of these mutants provides compelling evidence that the AAV capsid plays a role in the transcription of its genome, and the mutants map this functional region on the surface of the capsid near the 2-fold interface. This appears to be the first example of a viral structural protein that is also involved in the transcription of the viral genome that it delivers to the nucleus."

The present study aimed to examine whether the enhanced BBB penetrance of AAV-PHP.B observed in mice also occurs in non-human primates. Thus, a young adult (age, 1.6 years) and an old adult (age, 7.2 years) marmoset received an intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.B expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the constitutive CBh promoter (a hybrid of cytomegalovirus early enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter). Age-matched control marmosets were treated with standard AAV9-capsid vectors. The animals were sacrificed 6 weeks after the viral injection. Based on the results, only limited transduction of neurons (0-2%) and astrocytes (0.1-2.5%) was observed in both AAV-PHP.B- and AAV9-treated marmosets. One noticeable difference between AAV-PHP.B and AAV9 was the marked transduction of the peripheral dorsal root ganglia neurons. Indeed, the soma and axons in the projection from the spinal cord to the nucleus cuneatus in the medulla oblongata were strongly labeled with EGFP by AAV-PHP.B.

Glucocorticoids also enable modulation of vascular permeability. First, this study investigated the impact of dexamethasone on AAV vascular permeability after systemic injection. When a low dose of AAV9 was injected into mice treated with dexamethasone, global transduction and vector biodistribution were not significantly different in most tissues, other than the liver and the heart, when compared to control mice. When AAV9 vectors were used at a high dose, both the transgene expression and the AAV vector genome copy number were significantly decreased in the majority of murine tissues. However, no effect on global transduction was observed when dexamethasone was administered 2 h after AAV vector injection. The study on the kinetics of AAV virus clearance demonstrated that dexamethasone slowed down the clearance of AAV9 in the blood after systemic application. The mechanism study showed that dexamethasone inhibited the enhancement of AAV9 vascular permeability mediated by serum proteins. The findings indicate that dexamethasone is able to inhibit the vascular permeability of AAV and compromise the therapeutic effect after systemic administration of AAV vector.

Data on such post-translational modifications in the capsid of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotypes (AAV1-rh10) is limited. We have employed liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis to characterize post-translational modifications in AAV1-rh10 capsid protein. Our analysis revealed a total of 52 post-translational modifications in AAV2-AAVrh10 capsids, including ubiquitination (17%), glycosylation (36%), phosphorylation (21%), SUMOylation (13%) and acetylation (11%). While AAV1 had no detectable post-translational modification, at least four AAV serotypes had >7 post-translational modifications in their capsid protein. About 82% of these post-translational modifications are novel. A limited validation of AAV2 capsids by MALDI-TOF and western blot analysis demonstrated minimal glycosylation and ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids. To further validate this, we disrupted a glycosylation site identified in AAV2 capsid (AAV2-N253Q), which severely compromised its packaging efficiency (~ 100-fold vs. AAV2 wild-type vectors). In order to confirm other post-translational modifications detected such as SUMOylation, mutagenesis of a SUMOylation site(K258Q) in AAV2 was performed. This mutant vector demonstrated reduced levels of SUMO-1/2/3 proteins and negligible transduction, 2 weeks after ocular gene transfer. Our study underscores the heterogeneity of post-translational modifications in AAV vectors.

Effective delivery of AAV's genetic cargo to the nucleus, however, requires evasion of host cell barriers, including cellular clearance mechanisms mediated by the lysosome-autophagy system. We used AAV serotype 2 to monitor the autophagic response to cellular internalization of AAV and to characterize the effect of AAV-induced activation of autophagy on transgene expression. We found AAV2 internalization to induce activation of transcription factor EB, a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of the lysosome-autophagy system. We showed that AAV2-induced activation of autophagy parallels a reduction in transgene expression, but also an increase in autophagic clearance of protein aggregates. These results can inform the design of AAV vectors with autophagy-modulating properties for applications ranging from the design of efficient gene delivery vectors to the treatment of diseases characterized by accumulation of autophagic cargo."

To do this, any serotype dependent steps need to be removed from the process. The harvest and initial capture steps that can satisfy all of the needs of a platform AAV process is the use of low pH and Triton in the harvest, followed by filtration and cation exchange chromatography (CEX) for initial capture. The low pH hydrolyses and removes the host cell DNA, a difficult contaminate to remove. CEX then provides a concentration and capture step.

A total of 205 samples, comprising 198 tissue samples from individuals of Indian origin and 7 different cell lines were investigated. A panel of 8 primate samples was used as controls. DNA from these samples was screened for the AAV capsid specific signature regions by a modified PCR and DNA sequencing approach. Further, we generated a single point mutation (S224A) in AAV3 vector, analogous to the mutation identified in a novel AAV3 sequence variant isolated from a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) sample. We further studied the infectivity of these vectors in HeLa and HS5 cells in vitro. Of the 205 samples analyzed, an AAV specific signature DNA sequence was detected in 92 samples (45%), including 85 out of 198 human tissues and in all the 7 human cell lines investigated. DNA sequencing analysis showed that AAV6(34%) was the most common serotype and identified predominantly in PBSCs. Interestingly, a comparative genotypic analysis in primate samples identified AAV3 specific DNA in most of the bone marrow or liver tissue analyzed (n = 7/8) suggesting species-specific differences in AAV infectivity.

A systemic administration of AAV vectors has been proposed in order to achieve global transduction, which requires that the AAV vector is capable of crossing the blood vessels. It has been demonstrated that serum proteins are able to directly interact with AAV virions to enhance liver transduction. In this study, we investigate whether the serum proteins have the potential to increase the capacity of AAV to diffuse through the endothelial cells and deliver the transgene into the whole body. First, we found that the direct interaction of serum with AAV9 virions increased the epithelial cell permeability of AAV9 in vitro. Several serum proteins with a potential effect on AAV vascular permeability have been identified from mass spectrometry analysis, including fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), platelet factor 4, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and plasminogen. The incubation of these serum proteins with AAV9 enhanced the global transduction in mice after a systemic administration. To apply these findings in clinical practice, we demonstrated that the clinical product cryoprecipitate (mainly containing fibrinogen and vWF) augmented AAV9 global transduction. The mechanism study revealed that cryoprecipitate slowed down the clearance of AAV9 vectors in the blood so that the AAV9 vectors had sufficient time to travel to the peripheral organs. In summary, the results from this study suggests that serum proteins interact with AAV virions and enhance the AAV9 vascular permeability for global transduction, and, more importantly, cryoprecipitate can be immediately applied for clinical patients who need the systemic administration of AAV vectors for global transduction."

Next, time course of AAV-DJ-mediated EGFP expression in fungiform taste cells was evaluated. Intragemmal EGFP signals appeared after a delay, rapidly increased until 7 days postinjection, and gradually decreased over the next few weeks probably because of the cell turnover. Finally, the taste cell types susceptible to AAV-DJ transduction were characterized.

In an attempt to identify novel compounds that enhance rAAV transduction, we performed two high-throughput screens comprising 2,396 compounds. We identified 13 compounds that were capable of enhancing transduction, of which 12 demonstrated vector-specific effects and 1 could also enhance vector-independent transgene expression. Many of these compounds had similar properties and could be categorized into five groups: epipodophyllotoxins (group 1), inducers of DNA damage (group 2), effectors of epigenetic modification (group 3), anthracyclines (group 4), and proteasome inhibitors (group 5). We optimized dosing for the identified compounds in several immortalized human cell lines as well as normal diploid cells. We found that the group 1 epipodophyllotoxins (teniposide and etoposide) consistently produced the greatest transduction enhancement. We also explored transduction enhancement among single-stranded, self-complementary, and fragment vectors and found that the compounds could impact fragmented rAAV2 transduction to an even greater extent than single-stranded vectors. In vivo analysis of rAAV2 and all of the clinically relevant compounds revealed that, consistent with our in vitro results, teniposide exhibited the greatest level of transduction enhancement. Finally, we explored the capability of teniposide to enhance transduction of fragment vectors in vivo using an AAV8 capsid that is known to exhibit robust liver tropism.

The AAVs are generally considered non-pathogenic, and they have the ability to attenuate the replication of other more pathogenic viruses, which makes them attractive as potential therapeutics or preventative measures. This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after propagating a field isolate of the DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The full genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared to other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of the structural and non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other Dependoparvovirus family members. These results suggest that MHH-05-2015 is a new subtype of AAV that is distinct from other avian AAVs."

Specifically, we generated truncated viral capsid subunits that, when combined with native capsid components into mosaic capsids, can perform robust activatable peptide display. By modulating the ratio of subunits in the mosaic capsid, properties of the activatable peptide display function can be optimized. Interestingly, the truncated subunits can form homomeric capsids not observed in nature, but at the price of losing the ability to carry out activatable peptide display. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of capsid mosaicism when activatable peptide display is desired and help explain why the wild-type AAV capsid exists as a mosaic of different subunits. This proof-of-concept study illustrates a strategy for reprogramming a particular conformational output behavior of AAV in pursuit of the long-term vision of creating stimulus-responsive nanodevices."

However, the installation of such capsid modifications currently faces two major challenges: (1) The complex and delicate capsid proteins often do not tolerate large modifications, and (2) capsid proteins are composed of the 20 canonical amino acids, precluding site-specific chemical modification of the virus. Here, we describe a technology for generating adeno-associated virus (AAV) while incorporating an unnatural amino acid (UAA) into specific sites of the virus capsid. Incorporation of this UAA is generally tolerated well, presumably due to its small structural footprint. The resulting virus can be precisely functionalized at the site of UAA incorporation using chemoselective conjugation strategies targeted toward the azido side chain of this UAA. This technology provides a powerful way to modify AAV with unprecedented precision to both probe and engineer its entry process."

Such model systems are powerful tools to study the virus biology and in particular for the identification and characterization of host factors playing a role in the viral infection cycle. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are heavily studied due to their use as gene delivery vectors. AAV relies on other helper viruses for successful replication and on host factors for several aspects of the viral life cycle. However the role of host and helper viral factors is only partially known. Production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors for gene delivery applications depends on knowledge of AAV biology and the limited understanding of host and helper viral factors may be precluding efficient production, particularly in heterologous systems. Model systems in simpler eukaryotes like the yeast S. cerevisiae would be useful tools to identify and study the role of host factors in AAV biology. Here we show that expression of AAV2 viral proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, AAP, Rep78, Rep52 and an ITR-flanked DNA in yeast leads to capsid formation, DNA replication and encapsidation, resulting in formation of infectious particles. Many of the AAV characteristics observed in yeast resemble those in other systems, making it a suitable model system. Future findings in the yeast system could be translatable to other AAV host systems and aid in more efficient production of rAAV vectors."

Since AAV vectors do not possess an integrase activity, application is restricted to terminally differentiated tissues if transgene expression is required long term. To overcome this limitation and to generate AAV vectors that persist episomally in dividing cells, AAV vector genomes were equipped with a scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR). After a mild antibiotic selection, cells transduced with AAV-S/MAR established colonies that maintained long-term transgene expression (>50 population doublings) from replicating AAV vector episomes in the absence of further selection. Unexpectedly, with a lesser but still significant efficiency, the control vector (AAV-ΔS/MAR), a standard single-stranded AAV vector, also established stable transgene-expressing colonies, most of which were maintained as replicating episomes rather than integrated vector genomes. Thus, based on the result in HeLa cells, it is concluded that AAV vector genomes per se possess the ability to establish episomal maintenance in proliferating cells, a feature that can be enhanced by incorporation of a foreign genomic element such as an S/MAR element."

As in degu, mRNA expression of enAAV-rep was specifically observed in the liver in Asian elephant.

First, the production parameters were evaluated using AAV2 as a model serotype. Second, all nine AAV serotypes were produced successfully with yields of 10(13)Vg/L cell culture. Subsequently, AAV2 and AAV6 serotypes were produced in 3-L controlled bioreactors where productions yielded up to 10(13)Vg/L similar to the yields obtained in shake-flasks.

Exploration of effective strategies to enhance AAV transduction and escape from Nab activity is still imperative. Previous studies have shown the compatibility of capsids from AAV serotypes and homology of recognition sites of AAV Nab located on different capsid subunits from one virion. In this study, we co-transfected AAV2 and AAV8 helper plasmids at different ratios (3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) to assemble haploid capsids and study both their transduction efficiency and Nab escape activity. After muscular injection, all of the haploid viruses induced higher transduction than their parental AAV vectors (2- to 9-fold over AAV2), with the highest of these being the haploid vector AAV2/8 3:1. After systemic administration, a 4-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with haploid AAV2/8 1:3 than that with AAV8 alone. We then packaged the therapeutic factor IX cassette into haploid AAV2/8 1:3 capsids and injected them into FIX knockout mice via the tail vein. Higher FIX expression and improved phenotypic correction were achieved with the haploid AAV2/8 1:3 virus vector when compared to that of AAV8. Additionally, the haploid virus AAV2/8 1:3 was able to escape AAV2 neutralization and did not increase capsid antigen presentation capacity when compared to AAV8. To improve the Nab evasion ability of the haploid virus, we produced the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 by co-transfecting AAV2, AAV8 and AAV9 helper plasmids at a ratio of 1:1:1. After systemic administration, a 2-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 than that with AAV8. Nab analysis demonstrated that the triploid AAV2/8/9 vector was able to escape Nab activity from mouse sera immunized with parental serotypes. These results indicate that polyploid viruses might potentially acquire advantages from parental serotypes for enhancement of AAV transduction and evasion of Nab recognition without increasing capsid antigen presentation in target cells. Polyploid AAV vectors can be generated from any AAV serotype, whether natural, rational, library derived or a combination thereof, providing a novel strategy that should be explored in future clinical trials in patients with neutralizing antibodies."

We observed that AAV7 consistently transduced human hepatocytes more efficiently than other serotypes in both immunohistochemistry assay and flow cytometry analysis. To better assess the future application of AAV7 for systemic administration in the treatment of hemophilia or other liver diseases, we analyzed the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV7 in sera from healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia. In the general population, the prevalence of NAbs to AAV7 was lower than that of AAV2 or AAV3B. However, a higher prevalence of AAV7 NAbs was found in patients with hemophilia.

In the absence of the helper virus, AAV can persist in an episomal or integrated form. Previous studies have analyzed the DNA damage response (DDR) induced upon AAV replication to understand how it controls AAV replication. In particular, it was shown that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, a major player of the DDR induced by double-stranded DNA breaks and stalled replication forks, could negatively regulate AdV and AAV replication during coinfection. In contrast, MRN favors HSV-1 replication and is recruited to AAV replication compartments that are induced in the presence of HSV-1. In this study, we examined the role of MRN during AAV replication induced by HSV-1. Our results indicated that knockdown of MRN significantly reduced AAV DNA replication after coinfection with wild-type (wt) HSV-1 or HSV-1 with the polymerase deleted. This effect was specific to wt AAV, since it did not occur with recombinant AAV vectors. Positive regulation of AAV replication by MRN was dependent on its DNA tethering activity but did not require its nuclease activities. Importantly, knockdown of MRN also negatively regulated AAV integration within the human AAVS1 site, both in the presence and in the absence of HSV-1. Altogether, this work identifies a new function of MRN during integration of the AAV genome and demonstrates that this DNA repair complex positively regulates AAV replication in the presence of HSV-1."

These proteins are multifunctional, with an N-terminal origin-binding domain (OBD) and a helicase domain joined together by a short linker. As a first step to understand the process of site-specific integration, we proceeded to characterize the recognition and assembly of Rep68 onto the AAVS1 site. We first determined the x-ray structure of AAV-2 Rep68 OBD in complex with the AAVS1 DNA site. Specificity is achieved through the interaction of a glycine-rich loop that binds the major groove and an α-helix that interacts with a downstream minor groove on the same face of the DNA. Although the structure shows a complex with three OBD molecules bound to the AAVS1 site, we show by using analytical centrifugation and electron microscopy that the full-length Rep68 forms a heptameric complex. Moreover, we determined that a minimum of two direct repeats is required to form a stable complex and to melt DNA. Finally, we show that although the individual domains bind DNA poorly, complex assembly requires oligomerization and cooperation between its OBD, helicase, and the linker domains. "

Considerable efforts have been made to engineer AAV variants with novel and biomedically valuable cell tropisms to allow efficacious systemic administration, yet basic aspects of AAV cellular entry are still poorly understood. In particular, the protein receptor(s) required for AAV entry after cell attachment remains unknown. Here we use an unbiased genetic screen to identify proteins essential for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) infection in a haploid human cell line. The most significantly enriched gene of the screen encodes a previously uncharacterized type I transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L (denoted hereafter as AAV receptor (AAVR)). We characterize AAVR as a protein capable of rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane and trafficking to the trans-Golgi network. We show that AAVR directly binds to AAV2 particles, and that anti-AAVR antibodies efficiently block AAV2 infection. Moreover, genetic ablation of AAVR renders a wide range of mammalian cell types highly resistant to AAV2 infection. Notably, AAVR serves as a critical host factor for all tested AAV serotypes. The importance of AAVR for in vivo gene delivery is further highlighted by the robust resistance of Aavr(-/-) (also known as Au040320(-/-) and Kiaa0319l(-/-)) mice to AAV infection.

To date, AAV is safe in patients, with clinical benefit in trials to treat blindness, hemophilia, and a lipid disorder, with many more trials underway. Despite this remarkable progress, barriers exist for AAV vectors to be effective gene transfer vehicles in all organ/cell targets, as well as patient subpopulations. Extracellular vesicles (EVs, e.g., exosomes, microvesicles) are natural lipid particles released by many cell types. They have been reported to mediate cell to cell communication via transferred contents including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. These properties of EV attracted our attention to help solve certain gene transfer issues encountered by AAV vectors. We made the initial discovery that a subpopulation of AAV vectors isolated from media directly interacted with EVs [referred to as exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV)]. In following reports, we have demonstrated that exo-AAV has advantages over the conventional AAV vector in areas such as anti-AAV antibody evasion and transduction of cells of the eye and cochlea in preclinical models.

Titer-matched AAV6 (as control), AAVshH10, and AAVshH19, all encoding the EGFP driven by the constitutively active CMV promoter, as well as AAV6-EGFP and AAVshH10-EGFP driven by a GFAP promoter (AAV6-GFAP-EGFP and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP), were injected into DRG of adult male rats. Neurotropism of gene expression was determined and compared by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that injection of AAV6- and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP induces robust EGFP expression selectively in SGCs, whereas injection of either AAVshH10-CMV-EGFP or AAVshH19-CMV-EGFP into DRG resulted in a similar in vivo transduction profile to AAV6-CMV-EGFP, all showing efficient transduction of sensory neurons without significant transduction of glial cell populations. Coinjection of AAV6-CMV-mCherry and AAV6-GFAP-EGFP induces transgene expression in neurons and SGCs separately. This report, together with our prior studies, demonstrates that the GFAP promoter rather than capsid tropism determines selective gene expression in SGCs following intraganglionic AAV delivery in adult rats. A dual AAV system, one with GFAP promoter and the other with CMV promoter, can efficiently express transgenes selectively in neurons versus SGCs."

We recently developed a synthetic protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that transduces cells preferentially in environments rich in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are elevated in a variety of diseases, including various cancers and heart diseases. The provector displays peptide locks made up of MMP recognition sites flanking an inactivating sequence (IS) composed of four aspartic acid residues (D4). When present, the IS prevents AAV from binding cell receptors and no transduction occurs (OFF state). High levels of MMPs cleave the recognition sequences and release the IS from the capsid surface, restoring cell receptor binding (ON state). The AAV9 provector prototype is not optimal as it displays baseline OFF transduction at 5-10% of that of the wild-type capsid, which can lead to off-target delivery. We hypothesized that changes to the IS may decrease OFF state transduction. We created a provector panel with IS of lengths 0 (D0) to 10 (D10) aspartic acid residues and characterized this panel in vitro. Notably, we find that the D10 provector has an OFF transduction of less than 1% of wild-type capsid and an ON/OFF transduction ratio of 27, the best outcome achieved for any provector thus far. In summary, our results enable us to define new design rules for the provector platform, specifically that (1) the IS is necessary for provector locking and (2) increasing the number of aspartic acid residues in this sequence improves locking."

The use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) has proven to be an effective method of transfecting whole organs in live animals. We examined whether intrapancreatic duct infusion of AAV containing an NF-κB-luciferase reporter (AAV-NF-κB-luciferase) can reliably measure pancreatic NF-κB activation. We confirmed the infectivity of the AAV-NF-κB-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells using a traditional luciferase readout. Mice were infused with AAV-NF-κB-luciferase 5 weeks before induction of pancreatitis (caerulein, 50 μg/kg). Unlike transgenic mice that globally express NF-κB-luciferase, AAV-infused mice showed a 15-fold increase in pancreas-specific NF-κB bioluminescence following 12 h of caerulein compared with baseline luminescence (p < 0.05). The specificity of the NF-κB-luciferase signal to the pancreas was confirmed by isolating the pancreas and adjacent organs and observing a predominant bioluminescent signal in the pancreas compared with liver, spleen, and stomach. A complementary mouse model of post-ERCP-pancreatitis also induced pancreatic NF-κB signals. Taken together these data provide the first demonstration that NF-κB activation can be examined in a live, dynamic fashion during pancreatic inflammation. We believe this technique offers a valuable tool to study real-time activation of NF-κB in vivo. "

Whereas AAV-2 is dependent on adenoviral functions for productive replication, it conversely inhibits adenoviral replication, both when its genome is present in trans after coinfection with both viruses and when it is present in cis, as in the production of recombinant adenovirus (rAd)/AAV-2 hybrid vectors. The notion that AAV-mediated inhibition of adenoviral replication is due predominantly to the expression of the AAV-2 Rep proteins was recently challenged by successful Rep78 expression in a rAd5 vector through recoding of the Rep open reading frame (ORF). We closely analyzed the relative contributions of AAV-2 nucleic acid elements and Rep protein expression to the inhibition of adenoviral replication in both of the above scenarios. When present in cis, a sequence element in the 3' part of the rep gene, comprising only the AAV-2 p40 promoter and the AAV-2 intron sequence, which we termed the RIS-Ad, completely blocks adenoviral replication. p5/p19 promoter-driven Rep protein expression, on the other hand, only weakly inhibits rAd/AAV-2 vector propagation, and by inactivation of the RIS-Ad, it is feasible to generate first-generation rAd vectors expressing functional Rep proteins. The RIS-Ad plays no role in the inhibition of adenoviral replication in trans in a model closely mimicking AAV-2-Ad coinfection. In this case, expression of the Rep proteins is required, as well as the presence of an amplifiable inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-containing template. Thus, very different AAV-2 elements and mechanisms are involved in inhibition of adenoviral replication during rAd/AAV-2 vector propagation and after Ad-AAV coinfection."

AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy ameliorated the photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairments of the RD animal model. Furthermore, the multi-electrodes array (MEA) was used to detect the firing activities of retinal ganglion cells. MEA recording showed that the EPO therapy could restrain the spontaneous firing response, enhance the light-induced firing response and preserve the basic configurations of visual signal pathway in RD model. Our MEA assay provided an example to evaluate the potency of pharmacological compounds on retinal plasticity. In conclusion, AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy can ameliorate the photoreceptor degeneration and rectify the abnormities in visual signal transmission.

This permits incorporation of genomic sequences as well as cDNA, large transcriptional regulatory sequences for cell-specific expression, multiple transgene cassettes, or genetic elements from other viruses. Hybrid vectors use elements from HSV-1 that allow replication and packaging of large-vector DNA into highly infectious particles, and elements from other viruses that confer genetic stability to vector DNA in the transduced cell. For example, adeno-associated virus (AAV) has the unique ability to integrate its genome into a specific site on human chromosome 19. The viral rep gene and the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the AAV genome are sufficient for this process. However, AAV-based vectors have a very small transgene capacity and do not conventionally contain the rep gene to support site-specific genomic integration. HSV/AAV hybrid vectors contain both HSV-1 replication and packaging functions and the AAV rep gene and a transgene cassette flanked by the AAV ITRs. This combines the large transgene capacity of HSV-1 with the capability of site-specific genomic transgene integration and long-term transgene expression of AAV. This protocol describes the preparation of HSV/AAV hybrid vectors using a replication-competent/conditional, packaging-defective HSV-1 genome cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to provide helper functions for vector replication and packaging. The advantages and limitations of such vectors compared to standard HSV-1 amplicon vectors are also discussed."

The adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors used in these trials have been long known to be relatively safe and efficacious. However, certain factors, most notably host immunity to the vector, prevent their widespread use. In patients who have pre-existing antibodies to AAV, these vectors will be rapidly cleared. Administration of a relatively high initial dose of vector to achieve and sustain a higher margin of therapeutic benefit is limited by concerns of vector dose-dependent T cell response. Frequent vector administration necessitated by the non-integrating nature of the virus is difficult due to the variable, yet significant host immunological memory. Thus generation of AAV vectors that are immunologically inert is pivotal for the long-term success with this promising vector system. Several strategies, that aim targeted disruption of antigenic sites or those that chemically modify the vectors have been proposed for host immune evasion. While these approaches have been successful in the pre-clinical model systems, this continues to be a field of intense experimentation and constant improvisation due to limited information available on vector immunology or data from human studies. This review forms a comprehensive report on current strategies available to generate immunologically inert AAV vectors and their potential in mediating longterm gene transfer. "

This review presents several design strategies that have been applied to generate AAVs that target specific tissues and cells while inhibiting the transduction of non-target tissues. Multiple methods of vector capsid engineering have shown promise in vitro, including indirect targeting by adaptor systems and direct targeting by the insertion of antibodies or receptor-specific small peptide motifs.

This study revealed that a genetically engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant, AAVr3.45, inherently possesses dual beneficial properties as a gene carrier: (i) efficiently delivering therapeutic genes to many clinically valuable cells (e.g., stem or cancer cells) and (ii) effectively bypassing immunoglobulin (IgG) neutralization. Detailed interpretation of the structural features of AAVr3.45, which was previously engineered from AAV2, demonstrated that the LATQVGQKTA peptide at the heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding domain, especially the presence of cationic lysine on the peptide, served as a key motif for dramatically enhancing its gene delivery capabilities, ultimately broadening its tropisms for many cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the substitution of valine on the AAV2 capsid at the amino acid 719 site to methionine functioned as a coordinator for promoting viral resistance against IgG inactivation. The NAb-resistant characteristics of AAVr3.45 were possibly associated with the LATQVGQKTA sequence itself, indicating that its synergistic cooperation with the point mutation (V719M) is required for maximizing its ability to evade NAb inactivation. The potential of AAVr3.45 as a cancer gene therapy agent was confirmed by provoking apoptosis in breast adenocarcinoma by efficiently delivering a pro-apoptotic gene, BIM (Bcl-2-like protein 11), under high titers of human IgG. Thus, the superior aspects of the NAb-resistant AAVr3.45 as a potential therapeutic agent for systemic injection approaches, especially for cancer gene therapy, were highlighted in this study."

Herein, we explored the effect of the FerA domains, which are derived from ferlin proteins and possess membrane-fusion activity, on AAV transduction. Our results show that FerA domains from dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin proteins are able to directly interact with AAV vectors and enhance AAV transduction in vitro and in mice through either intravenous or intramuscular injections. The enhanced AAV transduction induced by human/mouse FerA domains is achieved in various cell lines and in mice regardless of AAV serotypes. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the FerA domains could effectively enhance the ability of AAV vectors to bind to target cells and cross the vascular barrier. Additionally, FerA domains slow down the blood clearance of AAV. Systemic administration of AAV8/hFIX-FerA complex induced approximate 4-fold more human coagulation factor IX expression and improved hemostasis in hemophilia B mice than that of AAV8/hFIX. Collectively, we show, for the first time, that multiple FerA domains could be tethered on the AAV capsid and enhance widespread tissue distribution in an AAV serotypes-independent manner.

The main purpose of this investigation was to explore the antitumor activity of Bmi-1 interference driven by its own promoter (Ad-Bmi-1i) for GC. In this study, we used adenoviral vector to deliver Bmi-1 shRNA driven by its own promoter to treat GC. Our results revealed that Ad-Bmi-1i could selectively silence Bmi-1 in GC cells which overexpress Bmi-1 and suppress the malignant phenotypes and stem-like properties of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, direct injection of Ad-Bmi-1i into xenografts suppressed tumor growth and destroyed cancer cells in vivo. Ad-Bmi-1i inhibited the proliferation of GC cells mainly via inducing senescence in vitro, but it suppressed tumor through inducing senescence and apoptosis, and inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo. Bmi-1 knockdown by Ad-Bmi-1i downregulated VEGF via inhibiting AKT activity. These results suggest that Ad-Bmi-1i not only inhibits tumor growth and stem cell-like phenotype by inducing cellular senescence directly, but also has an indirect anti-tumor activity by anti-angiogenesis effects via regulating PTEN/AKT/VEGF pathway.

However, siRNA is characterized by low transduction efficiency, insufficient inhibition of gene expression, and short duration of therapeutic effects, and is thus not ideal for treatment of neural tissues and diseases. To address these problems, viral delivery of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes that support more efficient and long-lasting transduction into target tissues is expected to be a promising delivery tool. Various types of gene therapy vectors have been developed, such as adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), herpes simplex virus and lentivirus; however, AAV is particularly advantageous because of its relative lack of immunogenicity and lack of chromosomal integration. In human clinical trials, recombinant AAV vectors are relatively safe and well-tolerated. In particular, serotype 9 of AAV (AAV9) vectors show the highest tropism for neural tissue and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and we have shown that intrathecal delivery of AAV9 yields relatively high gene transduction into dorsal root ganglia or spinal cord.

Current manufacturing procedures necessitate laborious and time-consuming purification procedures to obtain AAV particles of sufficient titer and purity for these demanding biomedical applications. The finding that AAV can be harvested and purified from producer cell medium may represent an efficient alternative to purifying AAV from cellular lysates. Here we sought to determine the maximum duration of time, and frequency within which AAV can be harvested from producer cell medium, in order to maximize the yield obtained from a single transfection preparation. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with polyethylenimine to produce AAV2/5 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cellular medium was harvested every 2 days until a maximum duration of 19 days posttransfection. AAV2/5-GFP was released into producer cell medium at a steady state until 7 days posttransfection, at which time titers dropped dramatically. Harvesting medium every two days resulted in the maximum yield of AAV from a single preparation, and the cumulative yield of AAV harvested from the producer cell medium was 4-fold higher than the yield obtained from a traditional purification of AAV from cellular lysates. The AAV2/5 harvested from medium within the 7-day collection time-course mediated high levels of transduction in vivo, comparable to AAV2/5 harvested from cellular lysates. AAV purified from cell lysates showed increasing amounts of empty particles at 5 and 7 days posttransfection, whereas AAV purified from cell medium did not show an increase in the amount of empty particles throughout the 7-day time course.

Specifically, synthetic variants obtained by evolving murine antigenic epitopes on an AAV serotype 1 capsid template can evade NAbs without compromising titer, transduction efficiency, or tissue tropism. One lead AAV variant generated by combining multiple evolved antigenic sites effectively evades polyclonal anti-AAV1 neutralizing sera from immunized mice and rhesus macaques. Furthermore, this variant displays robust immune evasion in nonhuman primate and human serum samples at dilution factors as high as 1:5, currently mandated by several clinical trials. Our results provide evidence that antibody recognition of AAV capsids is conserved across species. This approach can be applied to any AAV strain to evade NAbs in prospective patients for human gene therapy."

In the current study, the binding site on AAV serotype 3B for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor has been characterized. X-ray diffraction identified a disaccharide binding site at the most positively charged region on the virus surface. The contributions of basic amino acids at this and other sites were characterized using site-directed mutagenesis. Both heparin and cell binding are correlated to positive charge at the disaccharide binding site, and transduction is significantly decreased in AAV-3B vectors mutated at this site to reduce heparin binding. While the receptor attachment sites of AAV-3B and AAV-2 are both in the general vicinity of the viral spikes, the exact amino acids that participate in electrostatic interactions are distinct. Diversity in the mechanisms of cell attachment by AAV serotypes will be an important consideration for the rational design of improved gene therapy vectors."

While it is likely that capsid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate vector-transduced hepatocytes, thereby resulting in decreased hFIX, this observation is not intuitively consistent with restored hFIX levels following prednisone application. Although the innate immune response is immediately activated following AAV vector infection via TLR pathways, no studies exist regarding the role of the innate immune response at later time points after AAV vector transduction. Herein, activation of the innate immune response in cell lines, primary human hepatocytes, and hepatocytes in a human chimeric mouse model was observed at later time points following AAV vector transduction. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5 was necessary for innate immune response activation and that transient knockdown of MDA5, or MAVS, decreased IFN-β expression while increasing transgene production in AAV-transduced cells. These results both highlight the role of the dsRNA-triggered innate immune response in therapeutic transgene expression at later time points following AAV transduction and facilitate the execution of effective strategies to block the dsRNA innate immune response in future clinical trials."

In contrast, AAV-mediated gene transfer into liver or muscle tissue for diseases such as hemophilia B, α1 anti-trypsin deficiency and muscular dystrophy has demonstrated a decline in gene transfer efficacy over time. It is now known that in humans, AAV triggers specific pathways that recruit immune sensors. These factors initiate an immediate reaction against either the viral capsid or the vector encoded protein as part of innate immune response or to produce a more specific adaptive response that generates immunological memory. The vector-transduced cells are then rapidly destroyed due to this immune activation. However, unlike other viral vectors, AAV is not immunogenic in murine models. Its immunogenicity becomes apparent only in large animal models and human subjects. Moreover, humans are natural hosts to AAV and exhibit a high seroprevalence against AAV vectors. This limits the widespread application of AAV vectors into patients with pre-existing neutralising antibodies or memory T cells. To address these issues, various strategies are being tested. Alternate serotype vectors (AAV1-10), efficient expression cassettes, specific tissue targeting, immune-suppression and engineered capsid variants are some approaches proposed to minimise this immune stimulation. In this review, we have summarised the nature of the immune response documented against AAV in various pre-clinical and clinical settings and have further discussed the strategies to evade them."

Multiple GAGY/C repeats, resembling consensus AAV Rep-binding sites are preferred, whereas rep-deficient AAV vectors (rAAV) regularly show a random integration profile. This study is the first study to analyze wild-type AAV integration in diploid human fibroblasts. Applying high-throughput third-generation PacBio-based DNA sequencing, integration profiles of wild-type AAV and rAAV are compared side by side. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that both wild-type AAV and rAAV prefer open chromatin regions. Although genomic features of AAV integration largely reproduce previous findings, the pattern of integration hot spots differs from that described in HeLa cells before. DNase-Seq data for human fibroblasts and for HeLa cells reveal variant chromatin accessibility at preferred AAV integration hot spots that correlates with variant hot spot preferences. DNase-Seq patterns of these sites in human tissues, including liver, muscle, heart, brain, skin, and embryonic stem cells further underline variant chromatin accessibility. In summary, AAV integration is dependent on cell-type-specific, variant chromatin accessibility leading to random integration profiles for rAAV, whereas wild-type AAV integration sites cluster near GAGY/C repeats."

It is necessary to develop new treatment methods to control neovascularization with a stable and effective effect. Kringle1 domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGFK1) has anti-angiogenesis activity. Here, we established oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model to study if using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a delivery system to overexpression HGFK1 in retinal cells could benefit retinal neovascularization. We show that, overexpressed exogenous gene was mainly expressed in the inner and outer nuclear layer of the retina. Compared with control mice, the mice pretreated with rAAV-HGFK1 at P3 showed relatively normal vascular branches examined by fluorescence fundus angiography. Subsequent H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining of CD31 of the eye tissue sections showed that the mice received rAAV-HGFK1 had a relatively normal distribution of vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining indicated a lower expression of VEGF in the eye tissues of rAAV-HGFK1 treated OIR mice. Further in vitro studies showed that HGFK1 could inhibit the proliferation but promote the apoptosis of bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRECs) under the presence of VEGF. Moreover, HGFK1 could inhibit VEGF induced ERK activation but promote p38 activation in BRECs. Therefore, we propose that intravitreal injection of rAAV-HGFK1 might be used to improve the retinal neovascularization and HGFK1 may function through regulating VEGF signaling pathway to inhibit neovascularization."

However, its transduction capabilities are not optimal due to the interaction with various host factors within the cell. In a previous study, we identified members of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway as significant restriction factors in AAV gene transduction. In the present study, we explored the scope of this restriction by focusing on the AAV capsid and host cell proteins as targets. We show that during vector production, the capsid protein VP2 becomes SUMOylated, as indicated by deletion and point mutations of VP2 or the obstruction of its N terminus via the addition of a tag. We observed that SUMOylated AAV capsids display higher stability than non-SUMOylated capsids. Prevention of capsid SUMOylation by VP2 mutations did not abolish transduction restriction by SUMOylation; however, it reduced activation of gene transduction by shutdown of the cellular SUMOylation pathway. This indicates a link between capsid SUMOylation and SUMOylation of cellular proteins in restricting gene transduction. Infection with AAV triggers general SUMOylation of cellular proteins. In particular, the DAXX protein, a putative host cell restriction factor that can become SUMOylated, is able to restrict AAV gene transduction by reducing the intracellular accumulation of AAV vectors. We also observe that the coexpression of a SUMOylation inhibitor with an AAV2 reporter gene vector increased gene transduction significantly."

While animal models are very useful, they often exhibit differences in retinal cell surface receptors compared to the human retina. This study evaluated the use of an ex vivo organotypic explant system to test the transduction efficiency and tropism of seven different adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) serotypes in the human retina and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid-AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/4, AAV2/5, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, and AAV2/9-all driving expression of GFP under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 7 days in culture, it was found that AAV2/4 and AAV2/5 were particularly efficient at transducing photoreceptor cells and that AAV2/5 was highly specific to the outer nuclear layer, whereas AAV2/8 displayed consistently low transduction of photoreceptors. To validate the authenticity of the organotypic culture system, the transduction of the same set of AAVs was also compared in a pig model, in which sub-retinal injections in vivo were compared to cultured and transduced organotypic cultures ex vivo.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype also predicts the timing and amount of brain amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition and amyloid burden (ε4 >ε3 >ε2). Using several administration protocols, we now report that direct intracerebral adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of APOE2 markedly reduces brain soluble (including oligomeric) and insoluble Aβ levels as well as amyloid burden in 2 mouse models of brain amyloidosis whose pathology is dependent on either the expression of murine Apoe or more importantly on human APOE4. The efficacy of APOE2 to reduce brain Aβ burden in either model, however, was highly dependent on brain APOE2 levels and the amount of pre-existing Aβ and amyloid deposition. We further demonstrate that a widespread reduction of brain Aβ burden can be achieved through a single injection of vector via intrathalamic delivery of AAV expressing APOE2 gene. Our results demonstrate that AAV gene delivery of APOE2 using an AAV vector rescues the detrimental effects of APOE4 on brain amyloid pathology and may represent a viable therapeutic approach for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease especially if sufficient brain APOE2 levels can be achieved early in the course of the disease."

Here we describe that replacement of only one D sequence in either ITR restores each of these functions, but DNA strands of only single polarity are encapsidated in mature progeny virions. Since most commonly used recombinant AAV vectors contain a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is transcriptionally inactive, efficient transgene expression from AAV vectors is dependent upon viral second-strand DNA synthesis. We have also identified a transcription suppressor sequence in one of the D sequences, which shares homology with the binding site for the cellular NF-κB-repressing factor (NRF). The removal of this D sequence from, and replacement with a sequence containing putative binding sites for transcription factors in, single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) vectors significantly augments transgene expression both in human cell lines in vitro and in murine hepatocytes in vivo.

Some of the challenges include variable levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and poor transduction in specific target tissues and/or diseases. In addition, readministration of an rAAV vector is in general not possible due to the immune response against the capsid. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors with novel capsids can be isolated in nature or developed through different directed evolution strategies. However, in most cases, the process of AAV selection is not well understood and new strategies are required to define the best parameters to develop more efficient and functional rAAV capsids. Therefore, the use of barcoding for AAV capsid libraries, which can be screened by high-throughput sequencing, provides a powerful tool to track AAV capsid evolution and potentially improve AAV capsid library screens. In this study, we examined how different parameters affect the screen of two different AAV libraries in two human cell types. We uncovered new and unexpected insights in how to maximize the likelihood of obtaining AAV variants with the desired properties. The major findings of the study are the following. (1) Inclusion of helper-virus for AAV replication can selectively propagate variants that can replicate to higher titers, but are not necessarily better at transduction. (2) Competition between AAVs with specific capsids can take place in cells that have been infected with different AAVs. (3) The use of low multiplicity of infections for infection results in more variation between screens and is not optimal at selecting the most desired capsids. (4) Using multiple rounds of selection can be counterproductive. We conclude that each of these parameters should be taken into consideration when screening AAV libraries for enhanced properties of interest."

In particular, the trafficking steps preceding the release of incoming AAV particles from the endosomal system into the cytoplasm, allowing subsequent nuclear import and the initiation of gene expression, remain to be elucidated fully. Others and we previously showed that a significant proportion of viral particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus and that Golgi apparatus disruption caused by the drug brefeldin A efficiently blocks AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) transduction. However, because brefeldin A is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the entire endosomal system, the functional relevance of transport to the Golgi apparatus for AAV transduction remains to be established definitively. Here, we show that AAV2 trafficking toward the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the Golgi apparatus correlates with transduction efficiency and relies on a nonclassical retrograde transport pathway that is independent of the retromer complex, late endosomes, and recycling endosomes. AAV2 transduction is unaffected by the knockdown of syntaxins 6 and 16, which are two major effectors in the retrograde transport of both exogenous and endogenous cargo. On the other hand, inhibition of syntaxin 5 function by small interfering RNA silencing or treatment with cyclized Retro-2 strongly decreases AAV2 transduction and transport to the Golgi apparatus. This inhibition of transduction is observed with several AAV serotypes and a number of primary and immortalized cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that syntaxin 5-mediated retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus is a broadly conserved feature of AAV trafficking that appears to be independent of the identity of the receptors used for viral attachment."

We sought to determine if application of rAAV to peripheral nerve termini at the epithelial surface would allow rAAV to traffic to sensory ganglia in a manner similar to that seen with HSV. We hypothesized that footpad or ocular inoculation with rAAV8 would result in transduction of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or trigeminal ganglia (TG), respectively. To test this, we inoculated the footpads of mice with various amounts of rAAV as well as rAAV capsid mutants. We demonstrated that this method of inoculation can achieve a transduction rate of >90% of the sensory neurons in the DRG that innervate the footpad. Similarly, we showed that corneal inoculation with rAAV vectors in the rabbit efficiently transduced >70% of the TG neurons in the optic tract. Finally, we demonstrated that coinfection of mouse footpads or rabbit eyes with rAAV vectors and HSV-1 resulted in colocalization in nearly all of the HSV-1-positive neurons.

AAVs have been demonstrated to be safe, and resulted in high and long-term expression in preclinical and clinical studies. However, there are still some concerns regarding the expression levels that can be achieved and the percentage of hepatocytes that can be transduced. Because of the cell-autonomous nature of most metabolic liver disorders, a high percentage of hepatocytes needs to be corrected in order to achieve a therapeutic effect. The goal of our work was to improve transduction efficacy of the liver by conveying the vector directly to hepatic tissue. Interventional radiology procedures were used to administer an AAV5 vector expressing a secreted form of human embryonic alkaline phosphatase (hSEAP) under the control of a liver-specific promoter to a clinically relevant animal model, Macaca fascicularis. Balloon occlusion of the regional hepatic venous flow was performed while injecting the vector either into the hepatic artery (HA) or, against flow, via the suprahepatic vein (SHV). In both cases the vector was injected into the right hepatic lobules, and the two routes were compared with conventional intravenous administration. Higher hSEAP levels were obtained when the vector was administered via SHV or HA than after intravenous injection. Furthermore, higher expression levels correlated with a higher number of vector genomes in the injected lobules. In conclusion, direct administration of AAV vectors via the hepatic blood flow with simultaneous balloon occlusion of the hepatic outflow increases liver transduction efficacy in comparison with systemic delivery and can be further improved in bigger animals or humans, where it would be technically feasible to inject the vector into the hepatic vasculature in the generality of lobules."

We demonstrate that sequences with hairpins or hairpin-like structures drive the generation of truncated AAV genomes through a polymerase redirection mechanism during viral genome replication.

Addressing this need, we used clinical assays that were validated according to guidelines for a comprehensive characterization of anti-AAV1, -AAV2, -AAV5, and -AAV8 immunity in large international cohorts of healthy donors and patients with hemophilia B. Here, we report a higher than expected average prevalence for anti-AAV8 (∼40%) and anti-AAV5 (∼30%) neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which is supported by strongly correlating anti-AAV IgG antibody titers. A similar anti-AAV8 NAb prevalence was observed in hemophilia B patients. In addition, a high co-prevalence of NAbs against other serotypes makes switching to gene therapy using another serotype difficult. As anti-AAV T cell responses are believed to influence transduction, we characterized anti-AAV T cell responses using interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) ELISpot assays, revealing a similar prevalence of IFN-γ responses (∼20%) against different serotypes that did not correlate with NAbs.

Gene therapy products, a relatively new strategy for drug design with very few licensed examples, represent a unique challenge for the measure of potency. Unlike traditional drugs, potency for a gene therapeutic is a tally of the measures of multiple steps, including infectivity, transcription, translation, protein modifications, proper localization of the protein product, and protein function. This is particularly challenging for products based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, which has poor in vitro infectivity, limiting the sensitivity and thus the usefulness of cell-based assays. A rigorous in vivo assay has been established that separately evaluates infection, transcription, and resulting protein levels with specifications for each based on real time polymerase chain reaction (DNA and RNA) and standard protein assays. For an acceptance criterion, an administered vector must have vector DNA, transgene mRNA, and transgene expressed protein each concurrently meet individual specifications or the production lot fails. Using the AAVrh.10 serotype as a model vector and three different transgenes as examples, the assay is based on intravenous administration of the vector to male mice. At 2 weeks, the harvested liver is homogenized and assessed for vector genome levels (to assess for vector delivery), mRNA (to assess vector infectivity and transcription), and protein in the liver or serum (to assess protein expression).

Moreover, rAAVs have a low immunogenic profile, and the various AAV serotypes and variants display broad but distinct tropisms. One limitation of rAAVs is that their genome-packaging capacity is only ∼5 kb. For most applications this is not of major concern because the median human protein size is 375 amino acids. Excluding the ITRs, for a protein of typical length, this allows the incorporation of ∼3.5 kb of DNA for the promoter, polyadenylation sequence, and other regulatory elements into a single AAV vector. Nonetheless, for certain diseases the packaging limit of AAV does not allow the delivery of a full-length therapeutic protein by a single AAV vector. Hence, approaches to overcome this limitation have become an important area of research for AAV gene therapy. Among the most promising approaches to overcome the limitation imposed by the packaging capacity of AAV is the use of dual-vector approaches, whereby a transgene is split across two separate AAV vectors. Coinfection of a cell with these two rAAVs will then-through a variety of mechanisms-result in the transcription of an assembled mRNA that could not be encoded by a single AAV vector because of the DNA packaging limits of AAV. The main purpose of this review is to assess the current literature with respect to dual-AAV-vector design, to highlight the effectiveness of the different methodologies and to briefly discuss future areas of research to improve the efficiency of dual-AAV-vector transduction.

However, the mouse cochlea is still developing at those time points, whereas in humans, the newborn inner ears are already fully mature. For effective gene therapy to treat genetic deafness, it is necessary to determine whether AAV-mediated therapy can be equally effective in the fully mature mouse inner ear without causing damage to the inner ear. This study tested several AAV serotypes by canalostomy in adult mice. It is shown that most AAVs transduce the sensory inner hair cells efficiently, but are less efficient at transducing outer hair cells. A subset of AAVs also transduces non-sensory cochlear cell types. Neither the surgical procedure of canalostomy nor the AAV serotypes damage hair cells or impair normal hearing. The studies indicate that canalostomy can be a viable route for safe and efficient gene delivery, and they expand the repertoire of AAVs to target diverse cell types in the adult inner ear."

Virus vectors have been widely used for labeling particular subsets of neurons, and the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector has gained popularity as a tool for gene transfer. Here, we developed a single AAV vector Tet-Off platform, AAV-SynTetOff, to improve the gene-transduction efficiency, specifically in neurons. The platform is composed of regulator and response elements in a single AAV genome. After infection of Neuro-2a cells with the AAV-SynTetOff vector, the transduction efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was increased by approximately 2- and 15-fold relative to the conventional AAV vector with the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human synapsin I (SYN) promoter, respectively. We then injected the AAV vectors into the mouse neostriatum. GFP expression in the neostriatal neurons infected with the AAV-SynTetOff vector was approximately 40-times higher than that with the CMV or SYN promoter. By adding a membrane-targeting signal to GFP, the axon fibers of neostriatal neurons were clearly visualized. In contrast, by attaching somatodendritic membrane-targeting signals to GFP, axon fiber labeling was mostly suppressed. Furthermore, we prepared the AAV-SynTetOff vector, which simultaneously expressed somatodendritic membrane-targeted GFP and membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein (RFP). After injection of the vector into the neostriatum, the cell bodies and dendrites of neostriatal neurons were labeled with both GFP and RFP, whereas the axons in the projection sites were labeled only with RFP. Finally, we applied this vector to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive (VIP+) neocortical neurons, one of the subclasses of inhibitory neurons in the neocortex, in layer 2/3 of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. The results revealed the differential distribution of the somatodendritic and axonal structures at the population level.

The development of effective gene therapy requires an understanding of the vector's tissue-specific behavior, which may vary depending on serotype, route of delivery, or target species. Using an ex vivo organotypic explant system, we previously demonstrated that retinal tropism and transduction of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) varies significantly depending on serotype in human eyes. However, the ex vivo system has limited ability to assess route of ocular delivery, and relatively little literature exists on tropic differences between serotypes and routes of delivery in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that retinal tropism and transduction efficiency of five different AAV2 serotypes (AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, AAV2/9) expressing eGFP driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter vary greatly depending on serotype and route of delivery (intravitreal, subretinal, or suprachoroidal) in rats. With subretinal delivery, all serotypes successfully transduced the retinal pigmented epithelium and outer nuclear layer (ONL), with AAV2/1 displaying the highest transduction efficiency and AAV2/2 and AAV2/6 showing lower ONL transduction. There was minimal transduction of the inner retina via subretinal delivery for any serotype. Tropism by suprachoroidal delivery mirrored that of subretinal delivery for all AAV serotypes but resulted in a wider distribution and greater ONL transduction. With intravitreal delivery, retinal transduction was seen primarily in the inner retina (retinal nerve fiber, ganglion cell, and inner nuclear layers) for AAV2/1 and AAV2/6, with AAV2/6 showing the highest transduction. When compared to data from human explant models, there are substantial differences in tropism and transduction that are important to consider when using rats as preclinical models for the development of ocular gene therapies for humans."

In >95% of the cases, CAH results from mutations in the CYP21A2 gene, encoding the adrenal steroid enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21OH). Cardinal phenotypic features of CAH include genital ambiguity and sexual precocity, and in severe cases, neonatal salt loss and death. Current standard of care consists of lifelong oral steroid replacement to reverse the cortisol deficiency. Although significant advances in the treatment of CAH have been made, the burden of a lifelong therapeutic intervention is not ideal for quality of life. Gene therapy for CAH by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has been shown to efficiently transduce the adrenal cortex, restoring normal steroidogenesis in the short term. However, adrenocortical cells are continuously renewed by stem cells located at the adrenal capsule, which differentiate as they centripetally migrate towards the adrenal medulla where they undergo apoptosis. In this context, we hypothesized that AAV-mediated genetic correction of the adrenal cortex will work short term but will eventually lead to a loss of correction. To test this hypothesis, we administered intravenously an AAV serotype rh.10 gene transfer vector (AAVrh.10-21OH-HA) to 21-hydroxylase deficient mice (21OH"

To overcome this hurdle, an alternative mode of delivery of rAAV vectors in nonhuman primate muscles has been described: the locoregional (LR) intravenous route of administration. Using this injection mode, persistent inducible transgene expression for at least 1 year under the control of the tetracycline-inducible Tet-On system was previously reported in cynomolgus monkeys, with no immunity against the rtTA transgene product. The present study shows the long-term follow-up of these animals. It is reported that LR delivery of a rAAV2/1 vector allows long-term inducible expression up to at least 5 years post gene transfer, with no any detectable host immune response against the transactivator rtTA, despite its immunogenicity following i.m. gene transfer. This study shows for the first time a long-term regulation of muscle gene expression using a Tet-On-inducible system in a large-animal model. Moreover, these findings further confirm that the rAAV LR delivery route is efficient and immunologically safe, allowing long-term skeletal muscle gene transfer."

Approaches to engineer recombinant capsids for gene therapy applications have focused on rational design or library-based approaches that can address one or two desirable attributes; however, there is an unmet need to comprehensively improve AAV vector properties. Such cannot be achieved by utilizing sequence data alone but requires harnessing the three-dimensional (3D) structural properties of AAV capsids. Here, we solve the structures of a natural AAV isolate complexed with antibodies using cryo-electron microscopy and harness this structural information to engineer AAV capsid libraries through saturation mutagenesis of different antigenic footprints. Each surface loop was evolved by infectious cycling in the presence of a helper adenovirus to yield a new AAV variant that then serves as a template for evolving the next surface loop. This stepwise process yielded a humanized AAV8 capsid (AAVhum.8) displaying nonnatural surface loops that simultaneously display tropism for human hepatocytes, increased gene transfer efficiency, and neutralizing antibody evasion. Specifically, AAVhum.8 can better evade neutralizing antisera from multiple species than AAV8. Further, AAVhum.8 displays robust transduction in a human liver xenograft mouse model with expanded tropism for both murine and human hepatocytes. This work supports the hypothesis that critical properties, such as AAV capsid antibody evasion and tropism, can be coevolved by combining rational design and library-based evolution for clinical gene therapy."

The following AAV vectors were constructed: AAV-green fluorescent protein, AAV-VEGF, AAV-BMP, and AAV-VEGF/BMP. The rabbit model was induced using lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone. Virus vector was injected into the core decompression region at a dose of 25 μL per side after core decompression operation in each group. hVEGF165 and BMP-7 expressions were determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, and the femoral head was examined by magnetic resonance image scan, histopathologic staining, ink vessel staining, microcomputed tomography scan, and biomechanical assessment to determine the repair effect. The vector AAV-VEGF/BMP successfully expressed hVEGF165 and BMP-7 at the gene and protein levels at 12 weeks after virus injection. The expression of hVEGF165 promoted metabolism of the necrotic region by inducing vessel formation. The expression of BMP-7 promoted osteogenesis by increasing the mineral density and biomechanical strength of the femoral head. The repair effect of the AAV-VEGF/BMP group was better than those of the AAV-VEGF and AAV-BMP groups in the rabbit early SANFH model. The AAV-VEGF/BMP vector improved the bone repair capacity of the necrotic femoral head by inducing angiogenesis and improving bone quality in the femoral head."

Among these serotypes, the AAV type 2 vector has been used successfully in human gene therapies. However, the transduction efficiency of AAV2 depends on the cell type, and this poses a problem in the efficacy of gene therapy. To improve the transduction efficiency of AAV2, we designed a small peptide consisting of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor peptide and the HIV-Tat sequence Tat-Y1068. Pre- or co-treatment of CYNOM-K1 cells from cynomolgus monkey embryo skin with Tat-Y1068 increased the transduction efficiencies in a dose-dependent manner and caused p38 phosphorylation. The transduction efficiency of AAV2 into the rat fibroblast cell line RAT-1 highly expressing EGFR was less than the transduction efficiency of AAV2 into CYNOM-K1 cells. Tat-Y1068 increased the transduction efficiency in RAT-1 cells in the same manner as in CYNOM-K1 cells. In conclusion, cell-permeable peptides possessing the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor function might serve as a useful ingredient of AAV2 vector solution for increasing the transduction efficiency of gene therapies."

The gene expression and replication of AAV and derived recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are severely limited (>10-fold) by the cellular DNA damage-sensing complex made up of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN). The AAV genome does not encode the means to circumvent this block to productive infection but relies on coinfecting helper virus to do so. Using adenovirus helper proteins E1B55k and E4orf6, which enhance the transduction of AAV via degradation of MRN, we investigated the mechanism through which this DNA damage complex inhibits gene expression from rAAV. We tested the substrate specificity of inhibition and the contribution of different functions of the MRN complex. Our results demonstrate that both single- and double-stranded rAAV vectors are inhibited by MRN, which is in contrast to the predominant model that inhibition is the result of a block to second-strand synthesis. Exploring the contribution of known functions of MRN, we found that inhibition of rAAV does not require downstream DNA damage response factors, including signaling kinases ATM and ATR. The nuclease domain of Mre11 appears to play only a minor role in inhibition, while the DNA binding domain makes a greater contribution. Additionally, mutation of the inverted terminal repeat of the rAAV genome, which has been proposed to be the signal for interaction with MRN, is tolerated by the mechanism of inhibition. These results articulate a model of inhibition of gene expression in which physical interaction is more important than enzymatic activity and several key downstream damage repair factors are dispensable."

The attachment of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an example that has not proven amenable to crystallography, because the binding of GAG analogs disrupts lattice contacts. The interactions of AAV with GAGs are of interest in mediating the cell specificity of AAV-based gene therapy vectors. Previous electron microscopy led to differing conclusions on the exact binding site and the existence of large ligand-induced conformational changes in the virus. Conformational changes are expected during cell entry, but it has remained unclear whether the electron microscopy provided evidence of their induction by GAG-binding. Taking advantage of automated data collection, careful processing and new methods of structure refinement, the structure of AAV-DJ complexed with sucrose octasulfate is determined by electron microscopy difference map analysis to 4.8Å resolution. At this higher resolution, individual sulfate groups are discernible, providing a stereochemical validation of map interpretation, and highlighting interactions with two surface arginines that have been implicated in genetic studies. Conformational changes induced by the SOS are modest and limited to the loop most directly interacting with the ligand. While the resolution attainable will depend on sample order and other factors, there are an increasing number of macromolecular complexes that can be studied by cryo-electron microscopy at resolutions beyond 5Å, for which the approaches used here could be used to characterize the binding of inhibitors and other small molecule effectors when crystallography is not tractable.

AAV gene therapy has resulted in unprecedented clinical success for treating several inherited diseases. However, AAV gene therapy for DMD remains a significant challenge. Hurdles for AAV-mediated DMD gene therapy include the difficulty to package the full-length dystrophin coding sequence in an AAV vector, the necessity for whole-body gene delivery, the immune response to dystrophin and AAV capsid, and the species-specific barriers to translate from animal models to human patients. Capsid engineering aims at improving viral vector properties by rational design and/or forced evolution.

Notably, emerging technologies may provide promising new options for the treatment of CNS disorders. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) has been shown to transduce cells in the CNS following intravascular administration in rodents, cats, pigs, and non-human primates. These results suggest that AAV9 is capable of crossing the BBB. However, mechanisms that govern AAV9 transendothelial trafficking at the BBB remain unknown. Furthermore, possibilities that AAV9 may transduce brain endothelial cells or affect BBB integrity still require investigation. Using primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells as a model of the human BBB, we performed transduction and transendothelial trafficking assays comparing AAV9 to AAV2, a serotype that does not cross the BBB or transduce endothelial cells effectively in vivo. Results of our in vitro studies indicate that AAV9 penetrates brain microvascular endothelial cells barriers more effectively than AAV2, but has reduced transduction efficiency. In addition, our data suggest that (i) AAV9 penetrates endothelial barriers through an active, cell-mediated process, and (ii) AAV9 fails to disrupt indicators of BBB integrity such as transendothelial electrical resistance, tight junction protein expression/localization, and inflammatory activation status. Overall, this report shows how human brain endothelial cells configured in BBB models can be utilized for evaluating transendothelial movement and transduction kinetics of various AAV capsids. Importantly, the use of a human in vitro BBB model can provide import insight into the possible effects that candidate AVV gene therapy vectors may have on the status of BBB integrity.

This region contains five basic-amino-acid-rich (BR) clusters, KSKRSRR (AAP2BR1), RRR (AAP2BR2), RFR (AAP2BR3), RSTSSR (AAP2BR4), and RRIK (AAP2BR5), from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.

The results showed that AAP2(144-184) has redundant multipartite NLSs and that any combinations of 4 AAP2BRs, but not 3 or less, can constitute a functional NLS-NoLS; AAP2BR1 and AAP2BR2 play the most influential role for nuclear localization, but either one of the two AAP2BRs is dispensable if all 4 of the other AAP2BRs are present, resulting in 3 different, overlapping NLS motifs; and the NoLS is shared redundantly among the five AAP2BRs and functions in a context-dependent manner. AAP2BR mutations not only resulted in aberrant intracellular localization, but also attenuated AAP2 protein expression to various degrees, and both of these abnormalities have a significant negative impact on capsid production. Thus, this study reveals the organization of the intermingling NLSs and NoLSs in AAP2 and provides insights into their functional roles in capsid assembly."

Here we sought to characterize the safety of AAV-5 and AAV-6 for liver-mediated human factor IX (hFIX) expression in rabbits at doses of 1 × 10(12) or 1 × 10(13) viral genomes/kg. Circulating therapeutic levels of FIX were observed in both cohorts of AAV-6-hFIX, whereas for AAV-5-hFIX only the high dose was effective. Long-lasting inhibitory antibodies to hFIX were detected in three of the 10 AAV-6-injected animals but were absent in the AAV-5 group. Overall, vector shedding in the semen was transient and vector dose-dependent. However, the kinetics of clearance were remarkably faster for AAV-5 (3-5 weeks) compared with AAV-6 (10-13 weeks). AAV-6 vector sequences outside the liver were minimal at 20-30 weeks post-injection. In contrast, AAV-5 exhibited relatively high amounts of vector DNA in tissues other than the liver. Together these data are useful to further define the safety and potential for clinical translation of these AAV vectors."
