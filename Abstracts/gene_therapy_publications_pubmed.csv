However, as a result of lack of direct public funding and skilled personnel, direct research on gene therapy in Africa is currently limited and resources to support the endeavor are modest. A strength of the technology is that it is based on principles of rational design, and the tools of gene therapy are now highly versatile. For example gene silencing and gene editing may be used to disable viral genes for therapeutic purposes. Gene therapy may thus lead to cure from infections with HIV-1, hepatitis B virus and Ebola virus, which are of significant public health importance in Africa. Although enthusiasm for gene therapy is justified, significant challenges to implementing the technology remain. These include ensuring efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to target cells, limiting unintended effects, cost and complexity of treatment regimens. In addition, implementation of effective legislation that will govern gene therapy research will be a challenge. Nevertheless, it is an exciting prospect that gene therapy should soon reach the mainstream of medical management. Participation of African researchers in the exciting developments is currently limited, but their involvement is important to address health problems, develop capacity and enhance economic progress of the continent."

In recent years, the scope of gene therapy has been developed and is now beginning to revolutionize therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, many types of diseases are now being studied and treated in clinical trials through various gene delivery vectors. The emergence of recombinant DNA technology which provides the possibility of fetal genetic screening and genetic counseling is a good case in point. Therefore, gene therapy advances are being applied to correct inherited genetic disorders such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia as well as acquired diseases like cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and infectious diseases like HIV. As a result, gene therapy approaches have the ability to help the vast majority of newborns with different diseases. Since these ongoing treatments and clinical trials are being developed, many more barriers and challenges have been created. In order to continue this positive growth, these challenges need to be recognized and addressed. Accordingly, safety, efficiency and also risks and benefits of gene therapy trials for each disease should be considered. As a result, sustained manufacturing of the therapeutic gene product without any harmful side effects is the least requirement for gene therapy. Herein, different aspects of gene therapy, an overview of the progress, and also the prospects for the future have been discussed for the successful practice of gene therapy."

The intrauterine (IU) correction of gene expression, fetal gene therapy, could offer effective gene therapy approach for early onset diseases. Hence, the overall goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of human survival motor neuron (hSMN) gene expression after IU delivery in SMA mouse embryos. First, we found that IU-intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9)-EGFP led to extensive expression of EGFP protein in different parts of the CNS with a great number of transduced neural stem cells. Then, to implement the fetal gene therapy, mouse fetuses received a single i.c.v. injection of a single-stranded (ss) or self-complementary (sc) AAV9-SMN vector that led to a lifespan of 93 (median of 63) or 171 (median 105) days for SMA mice. The muscle pathology and number of the motor neurons also improved in both study groups, with slightly better results coming from scAAV treatment. Consequently, fetal gene therapy may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for treating inherited diseases such as SMA that lead to prenatal death or lifelong irreversible damage."

We conducted an academic survey in 2018 to assess cell and gene therapy manufacturing capacity in Australia and New Zealand. We examined the following: the number and types of cell therapy manufacturing facilities; the number of projects, parallel processes and clinical trials; the types of products; and the manufacturing and quality staffing levels. It was found that Australia and New Zealand provide diverse facilities for cell therapy manufacturing, infrastructure and capability. Further investment and development will enable both countries to make important decisions to meet the growing need for cell and gene therapy and regenerative medicine in the region."

Among the great discoveries that led to the design of genetic approaches to cure these disorders is the discovery of the β-globin locus control region and several associated transcription factors, which determine hemoglobin switching as well as high-level, erythroid-specific expression of genes at the ß-globin locus. Moreover, increasing evidence shows that lentiviral vectors are efficient tools to insert large DNA elements into nondividing hematopoietic stem cells, showing reassuring safe integration profiles. Alternatively, genome editing could restore expression of fetal hemoglobin or target specific mutations to restore expression of the wild-type β-globin gene. The most recent clinical trials for β-thalassemia and SCD are showing promising outcomes: patients were able to discontinue transfusions or had reduced transfusion requirements. However, toxic myeloablation and the high cost of current ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy platforms represent a barrier to a widespread application of these approaches. In this review, we summarize these gene therapy strategies and ongoing clinical trials. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to improve outcomes, reduce myeloablative regimens and future challenges to reduce the cost of gene therapy platform."

In a monocentric retrospective study and cost-efficacy analysis, this study compared the two-year outcomes and costs of patients with β-thalassemia treated by gene therapy and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Grade III and grade IV complications, hospitalizations, and length of stay were extracted from the hospital discharge data. Costs were estimated from hospital accounting information and national cost studies. A total of seven patients with β-thalassemia treated between 2009 and 2016 were included, of whom four received gene therapy. Patients treated by gene therapy were older and had fewer complications and hospital admissions. Infectious complications were three times more frequent for patients treated with HSCT than for gene therapy. Average costs were €608,086 for patients treated by gene therapy and €215,571 for HSCT. The total cost of the vector was 48% of the total cost of gene therapy. Gene therapy as a curative alternative for patients lacking human leukocyte antigen-matched donors was costlier but resulted in fewer complications than HSCT."

With the current pace of research, the significant investment of biotech companies, and the continuously growing toolbox of viral as well as non-viral gene delivery methods, the development of new ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy approaches is at an all-time high. Research in the field of gene therapy has been ongoing for more than 4 decades with big success stories as well as devastating drawbacks along the way. In particular, the damaging effect of uncontrolled viral vector integration observed in the initial gene therapy applications in the 90s led to a more comprehensive upfront safety assessment of treatment strategies. Since the late 90s, an important read-out to comprehensively assess the quality and safety of cell products has come forward with the mouse xenograft model. Here, we review the use of mouse models across the different stages of basic, pre-clinical and translational research towards the clinical application of HSC-mediated gene therapy and editing approaches."

For many in the financial community, a tangible signal for the emergence of the broader gene therapy space is the recent notable mergers and acquisitions activity, a signal that previously heralded the arrival of blockbuster biotechnologies like monoclonal antibodies. Notably, Novartis' $8.7 billion acquisition of in vivo adeno-associated virus 9-based gene therapy player, AveXis, earlier this year has focused many on looking for new investment opportunities in the space, thereby increasing interest in the valuation of gene therapy companies. This perspective discusses the theoretical underpinnings of company valuation and explains why traditional approaches have limitations when valuing in vivo gene therapy companies, which produce single treatments that may achieve durable or curative benefits. We use the AveXis case study to illustrate certain points on the valuation of breakthrough innovation that we think have broader applicability throughout the in vivo gene therapy space. This publication is the first in a three-part series. Future discussions in this series on in vivo gene therapy companies will explore real-world approaches and considerations that have already proven successful in mitigating the limitations of traditional valuation approaches as well as those that may soon emerge."

Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used to cure disorders such as hemoglobinopathies and primary immunodeficiencies; however, this method is limited by the availability of immune-matched donors. Using autologous cells coupled with genome editing bypasses this limitation and therefore became the focus of many research groups aiming to develop efficient and safe genomic modification. Hence, gene therapy research has witnessed a noticeable growth in recent years with numerous successful achievements; however, several challenges have to be overcome before gene therapy becomes widely available for patients. In this review, I discuss tools used in gene therapy for hematological disorders, choices of target cells, and delivery vehicles with emphasis on current hurdles and attempts to solve them, and present examples of successful clinical trials to give a glimpse of current progress."

GSD results from the deficiency of specific enzymes involved in the storage and retrieval of glucose in the body. Broadly, GSDs can be divided into types that affect liver or muscle or both tissues. For example, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) deficiency in GSD type Ia (GSD Ia) affects primarily the liver and kidney, while acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency in GSD II causes primarily muscle disease. The lack of specific therapy for the GSDs has driven efforts to develop new therapies for these conditions. Gene therapy needs to replace deficient enzymes in target tissues, which has guided the planning of gene therapy experiments. Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has demonstrated appropriate tropism for target tissues, including the liver, heart and skeletal muscle in animal models for GSD. AAV vectors transduced liver and kidney in GSD Ia and striated muscle in GSD II mice to replace the deficient enzyme in each disease. Gene therapy has been advanced to early phase clinical trials for the replacement of G6Pase in GSD Ia and GAA in GSD II (Pompe disease). Other GSDs have been treated in proof-of-concept studies, including GSD III, IV and V. The future of gene therapy appears promising for the GSDs, promising to provide more efficacious therapy for these disorders in the foreseeable future."

Prolonged imbalance between anabolism and catabolism in discs alters their composition resulting in progressive loss of proteoglycans and hydration leading to IVDD. The current managements for IVDD are only able to relieve the symptoms but do not address the underlying pathology of degeneration. Researchers have tried to find out differences between the aging and degeneration of the disc. Intense attempts are in progress for identifying the various factors responsible for disc degeneration, as well as strategies for regeneration. Recently biological approaches have gained thrust in the field of IVDD. The present review illustrates the current understanding of intervertebral disc degeneration and aims to put forth recent advancements in regeneration strategies involving different biological therapies such as growth factor, cell, and gene therapy. The potentials and consequences of these therapies are also extensively discussed along with citing the most suitable method, that is, the gene therapy in detail. Initially, gene therapy was mediated by viral vectors but recent progress has enabled researchers to opt for non-virus-mediated gene therapy methods, which ensure that there are no risks of mutagenicity and infection in target cells. With constant efforts, non-virus-mediated gene therapy may prove to be an extremely powerful tool in treatment of IVDD in future."

Studies have shown that viral-mediated ""gene therapy"" with overexpression of NPY in the hippocampus can suppress seizures in acquired epilepsy animal models. This study investigated whether NPY gene delivery to the thalamus or somatosensory cortex, using recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV), could produce sustained seizure suppression in the GAERS model of GGE with absence seizures. Three cohorts of GAERS were injected bilaterally into the thalamus (short term n = 14 and long term n = 8) or the somatosensory cortex (n = 26) with rAAV-NPY or rAAV-empty. EEG recordings were acquired weekly post-treatment and seizure expression was quantified. Anxiety levels were tested using elevated plus maze and open field test. NPY and NPY receptor mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Viral overexpression of human NPY in the thalamus and somatosensory cortex in GAERS significantly reduced the time spent in seizure activity and number of seizures, whereas seizure duration was only reduced after thalamic NPY overexpression. Human and rat NPY and rat Y2 receptor mRNA expression was significantly increased in the somatosensory cortex. NPY overexpression in the thalamus was observed in rAAV-NPY treated rats compared to controls in the long term cohort. No effect was observed on anxiety behaviour. We conclude that virally-mediated human NPY overexpression in the thalamus or somatosensory cortex produces sustained anti-epileptic effects in GAERS.

We used ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD), a novel targeted, non-viral approach to gene therapy, to deliver genes in the BAT differentiation pathway into rodent SKM to engineer a thermogenic BAT phenotype with ectopic mUCP-1 overexpression. In parallel, we performed a second protocol using wild-type Ucp-1-null knockout mice to test whether the effects of the gene therapy are UCP-1 dependent. Our main findings were a robust cellular presence of mUCP-1 immunostaining (IHC), significantly higher expression levels of mUCP-1 measured by qRT-PCR, and highest temperature elevation measured by infrared thermography in the treated thigh, achieved in rats after delivering the UTMD-PRDM16/PGC-1a/BMP7/hyPB gene cocktail. Interestingly, the weight loss obtained in the treated rats with the triple gene delivery, never recovered the levels observed in the controls in spite of food intake recovery. Our results establish the feasibility of minimally invasive UTMD gene-based therapy administration in SKM, to induce overexpression of ectopic mUCP-1 after delivery of the thermogenic BAT gene program, and describe systemic effects of this intervention on food intake, weight loss, and thermogenesis."

While gene therapy is progressively expanding its impact on a broader area of clinical applications, increasingly more accessible, faster, and more reliable safety readouts are required from IS analysis. Several actors, from researchers to clinicians, from regulatory agencies to private companies, have to interface to different degrees with the results of IS analysis while developing and evaluating gene therapy products based on retroviral vectors.

Because of cost and technical complexity, it is unlikely that such protocols will be applicable in developing countries, where the greatest demand for a β-thalassemia therapy lies. We have developed a simple in vivo HSPC gene therapy approach that involves HSPC mobilization and an intravenous injection of integrating HDAd5/35++ vectors. Transduced HSPCs homed back to the bone marrow, where they persisted long-term. HDAd5/35++ vectors for in vivo gene therapy of thalassemia had a unique capsid that targeted primitive HSPCs through human CD46, a relatively safe SB100X transposase-based integration machinery, a micro-LCR-driven γ-globin gene, and an MGMT(P140K) system that allowed for increasing the therapeutic effect by short-term treatment with low-dose O6-benzylguanine plus bis-chloroethylnitrosourea. We showed in ""healthy"" human CD46-transgenic mice and in a mouse model of thalassemia intermedia that our in vivo approach resulted in stable γ-globin expression in the majority of circulating red blood cells. The high marking frequency was maintained in secondary recipients. In the thalassemia model, a near-complete phenotypic correction was achieved. The treatment was well tolerated.

This more severe stage of PAD is known as 'critical limb ischaemia'. Treatments for PAD include medications that help to reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular events and help improve blood flow, as well as endovascular or surgical repair or bypass of the blocked arteries.

Recently published studies in adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy have demonstrated improvement in endogenous factor levels over sustained periods, significant reduction in annualised bleed rates, lower exogenous factor usage and thus far a positive safety profile. In making the shared decision to proceed with gene therapy for haemophilia, physicians should make it clear that research is ongoing and that there are remaining evidence gaps, such as long-term safety profiles and duration of treatment effect. The eligibility criteria for gene therapy trials mean that key patient groups may be excluded, eg children/adolescents, those with liver or kidney dysfunction and those with a prior history of factor inhibitors or pre-existing neutralising AAV antibodies. Gene therapy offers a life-changing opportunity for patients to reduce their bleeding risk while also reducing or abrogating the need for exogenous factor administration.

Nevertheless, the first attempts of gene therapy for SCID X1 were associated with insertional mutagenesis causing leukemia, because the viral enhancer induced transactivation of oncogenes. Removal of this element and use of a promoter instead led to safer but still efficacious gene therapy. It was observed that a fully diversified T cell repertoire could be generated by a limited set (<1,000) of progenitor cells.

Gene therapy promises to cure the disease ""at the root"" and is therefore exceptional in its potential, but also formidable in its challenges, as long-term side effects are hard to predict and clinical experience remains limited. Many excellent reviews on the topic by designated experts in the field of HSC-GT have come forth, elucidating the successes and pitfalls in the various clinical studies. This review attempts to discuss what we understand from those studies to represent current state of the art with respect to vectors, stem cell transduction, and pretransplant preparatory regimes, what limitations may remain, and which types of diseases may be more suited for HSC-GT than others (targets). We thus discuss the available vector platforms (tools) and preclinical/clinical and basic research (tricks) that contribute to our current understanding of HSC-GT, as well as some overarching principles we can conclude from these. The field has also learned from previous shortcomings, although some of the major concerns of the past, specifically insertional mutagenesis, may not be of relevance for future trials. This very positive development in HSC-GT, however, has to compete with the improvements in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or enzyme-replacement therapy, leaving a narrow margin for gene therapy."

In some cases, gene therapy consists of genetically modified cells, such as when chimeric antigen receptors are stably introduced into T lymphocytes, and used as tumor therapy, mainly for leukemias. Genetic therapy also includes oligonucleotides, which consist of around 20 nucleotides. Several such compounds have been approved for clinical use.

Furthermore, efforts to develop gene therapeutics have been narrowly focused and most clinical trials have sought to develop treatments for cancer (64.6%), monogenic diseases (10.5%), infectious diseases (7.4%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). In addition, nearly 70% of clinical trials have utilized viral-based delivery systems, despite various concerns associated with this strategy. Each of these factors highlights the lack of diversity in the development of gene therapeutics that should be addressed. In recent years, developments in gene manipulation and delivery such as CRISPR and non-viral vectors (e.g., liposomes) demonstrate promise for improving outcomes for gene therapy. The increased fidelity and capacity afforded by these technologies provide the potential to improve upon contemporary gene therapy approaches and enable the development of treatments for less-emphasized disorders.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of gene therapy treatment of severe hemophilia A compared with prophylaxis with factor VIII (FVIII), we developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the costs and effectiveness of severe hemophilia A treatment strategies from a United States health care system perspective. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were the effectiveness measure. In the base case, hypothetical cohorts of 30-year-old patients received gene therapy or FVIII prophylaxis. We obtained model probabilities and utilities from the literature and costs from Medicare reimbursement data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of results. Over a 10-year time horizon, total per-person gene therapy strategy costs were $1.0M and resulted in 8.33 QALYs, whereas prophylaxis cost $1.7M and resulted in 6.62 QALYs. Thus, gene therapy dominated prophylaxis (costs less and was more effective). Gene therapy remained dominant unless initial costs exceeded $1.6M and were <$100 000 per 1 QALY gained compared with prophylaxis if initial costs were <$1.7M. Results were not sensitive to variation of all other parameters over clinically plausible ranges. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis simultaneously varying all parameters 3000 times over parameter distributions, gene therapy was dominant in 92% of model iterations. Treatment of severe hemophilia A with gene therapy is likely to be cost-saving or cost-effective compared with FVIII prophylaxis."

Both non-disease and disease modifying transgenes have been tested for PD gene therapy in animal and human studies. Non-disease modifying treatments targeting dopamine or GABA synthesis have been successful and promising at improving PD symptomatology in randomized clinical studies, but substantial testing remains before these can be implemented in the standard clinical treatment repertoire. As for disease modifying targets that theoretically offer the possibility of slowing the progression of disease, several neurotrophic factors show encouraging results in preclinical models (e.g., neurturin, GDNF, BDNF, CDNF, VEGF-A). However, so far, clinical trials have only tested neurturin, and, unfortunately, no trial has been able to meet its primary endpoint. Future clinical trials with neurotrophic factors clearly deserve to be conducted, considering the still enticing goal of actually slowing the disease process of PD.

We have shown that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based platelet-specific factor VIII (FVIII) (2bF8) gene therapy can produce therapeutic protein and induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in HA mice, even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. For HSC-based gene therapy, traditional preconditioning using cytotoxic chemotherapy or total body irradiation (TBI) has been required. The potential toxicity associated with TBI or chemotherapy is a deterrent that may prevent patients with HA, a nonmalignant disease, from agreeing to such a protocol. Here, we describe targeted nongenotoxic preconditioning for 2bF8 gene therapy utilizing a hematopoietic cell-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which consists of saporin conjugated to CD45.2- and CD117-targeting antibodies. We found that a combination of CD45.2- and CD117-targeting ADC preconditioning was effective for engrafting 2bF8-transduced HSCs and was favorable for platelet lineage reconstitution. Two thirds of HA mice that received 2bF8 lentivirus-transduced HSCs under (CD45.2+CD117)-targeting ADC conditioning maintained sustained therapeutic levels of platelet FVIII expression. When CD8-targeting ADC was supplemented, chimerism and platelet FVIII expression were significantly increased, with long-term sustained platelet FVIII expression in all primary and secondary recipients. Importantly, immune tolerance was induced and hemostasis was restored in a tail-bleeding test, and joint bleeding also was effectively prevented in a needle-induced knee joint injury model in HA mice after 2bF8 gene therapy. In summary, we show for the first time efficient engraftment of gene-modified HSCs without genotoxic conditioning.

Currently, patient management is based on dietary treatment preventing severe hypoglycemia and increasing the lifespan of patients. However, most of the patients develop long-term pathologies.

Indeed, transgene loss over time was observed in GSDI liver, possibly due to the degeneration of hepatocytes underlying the physiopathology of both GSDI and GSDIII and leading to hepatic tumor development. Moreover, multitissue targeting requires high vector doses to target nonpermissive tissues such as muscle and kidney.

Although many patients with ED demonstrate efficacy with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, this therapy is insufficient in approximately 30-40% of patients. Although several preclinical studies for ED treatment provided promising results, gene therapy has not shown success in clinical practice, due in part to technical limitations of gene therapy to address ED pathogenesis. Developments in small RNA, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) may lead to significant benefit in the management of ED. Also, siRNA delivery into the corpus cavernosum seems a challenging issue and awaits further development. Several safety concerns of gene therapy, gene acquisition, preparation, and delivery are necessary to continue investigation before any widespread application is used in ED treatment."

In this study, four full-length bat AAV capsid genes were isolated in China, with their amino acid sequences sharing 61% identity with those of AAV2 on average. These capsid genes could package AAV particles in combination with AAV2 rep and ITRs, albeit at a lower efficiency. Bat AAVs could only slightly infect mouse liver but could transduce mouse muscle to some extent after systemic administration with a higher muscle/liver ratio than that of primate AAVs. Bat AAV 10HB showed moderate muscle transduction, similar to that of AAV2, during direct intramuscular injection and, compared with other AAV serotypes, was also relatively efficient in resisting human antibody neutralization after intramuscular injection. Evolutionary analysis revealed a number of codons in bat AAV capsid genes subject to positive selection, with sites corresponding to V259 and N691 in 10HB capsids being localized on the surface of the AAV2 capsid. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection in bat AAV capsids is driven by their tropism evolution in host species. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that bat AAV 10HB vector has the possible applications for muscular gene therapy, especially in the presence of human AAV neutralizing antibodies."

PD can present with cardiac, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system manifestations, as a continuum of phenotypes among two main forms: classical infantile-onset PD (IOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD). IOPD is caused by severe GAA deficiency and presents at birth with cardiac hypertrophy, muscle hypotonia, and severe respiratory impairment, leading to premature death, if not treated. LOPD is characterized by levels of residual GAA activity up to ∼20% of normal and presents both in children and adults with a varied severity of muscle weakness and motor and respiratory deficit. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), based on repeated intravenous (i.v.) infusions of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), represents the only available treatment for PD. Upon more than 10 years from its launch, it is becoming evident that ERT can extend the life span of IOPD and stabilize disease progression in LOPD; however, it does not represent a cure for PD. The limited uptake of the enzyme in key affected tissues and the high immunogenicity of rhGAA are some of the hurdles that limit ERT efficacy. GAA gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has been shown to reduce glycogen storage and improve the PD phenotype in preclinical studies following different approaches.

Initially, a group of poly(urethane amine)s were designed and characterized for in vitro gene transfection. The polyurethane containing 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine residue (PUBAP) could induce the best in vitro transfection efficacy against SKOV-3 or A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Next, dextran-enveloped PUBAP polyplexes (e-polyplexes) were constructed by a hierarchical assembly procedure involving gene neutralization with PUBAP and subsequent gene condensation with a cationic dextran (SSDP800). Such dextran comprised dextran (15 kDa) as the main chain and multiple disulfide-linked branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) oligomers as the side grafts. Additionally, folate-dextran-enveloped PUBAP polyplexes (FA-e-polyplexes) were fabricated by folate-modified SSDP800. These nanoscale-enveloped polyplexes elicited an improved colloidal stability against salt ions and negatively charged heparin, efficient endosomal escaping, and bioreduction-triggered intracellular gene release. In vitro transfection against SKOV-3 cells illustrated that FA-e-polyplexes exerted higher transfection efficiency in the serum than e-polyplexes and 25 kDa BPEI-polyplexes. In vivo, FA-e-polyplexes yielded higher transgene expression level than e-polyplexes in an SKOV-3 tumor-bearing nude mouse model. In the tumor gene therapy with a small hairpin RNA silencing vascular endothelial growth factor, FA-e-polyplexes afforded higher tumor growth inhibition than polyplexes of folate-PEGylated PUBAP and 25 kDa linear polyethylenimine as positive controls. Importantly, such gene therapy had minor toxic effects on the health of the mouse. This work highlights a practical hierarchical assembly method to construct innovative enveloped polyurethane nanopolyplexes enabling robust ovarian cancer gene therapy."

In the 1990s, studies in animal models showed that adeno-associated vectors (AAV) exhibited an efficient expression of factor IX (FIX). In the first clinical trial in patients with haemophilia B, therapeutic levels of FIX were documented but the expression remained only for few weeks. Subsequently, improvements in vector design, such as the use of different AAV serotypes, the development of the self-complementary vector, the engineering of the transgene with codon optimization and liver-specific expression cassette resulted in circulating FIX level between 2% and 5% for long-lasting period. Recently, a natural gain of function FIX variant (Padua) inserted in the F9 cDNA improved the expression of FIX achieving a level of more than 30% resulting in cessation of infusions and in a greatly reduction of bleeding events. Encouraging clinical progresses have been also obtained from trials of gene therapy for haemophilia A. Transgene expression persisted for three years with circulating FVIII activity levels of 52.3% in patients treated with AAV vector containing a codon-optimized F8 cDNA. A complication, reported in both clinical trials for haemophilia A and B, was the elevation of liver enzymes, which resolved with steroid treatment in a large group of patients.

Gene mutations have a great impact on the occurrence of cancer. Thus, gene therapy plays a major role in cancer therapy and has the potential to cure cancer. Well-designed gene therapy largely relies on effective gene carriers, which can be divided into viral carriers and non-viral carriers. A gene carrier delivers functional genes to their intracellular target and avoids nucleic acids being degraded by nucleases in the serum. Most conventional cancer gene therapies only target cancer cells and do not appear to be sufficintly efficient to pass clinical trials. Accumulating evidence has shown that extending the therapeutic strategies to the tumor microenvironment, rather than the tumor cell itself, can allow more options for achieving robust anti-cancer efficiency. In addition, unusual features between tumor microenvironment and normal tissues, such as a lower pH, higher glutathione and reactive oxygen species concentrations, and overexpression of some enzymes, facilitate the design of smart stimuli-responsive gene carriers regulated by the tumor microenvironment. These carriers interact with nucleic acids and then form stable nanoparticles under physiological conditions. By regulation of the tumor microenvironment, stimuli-responsive gene carriers are able to change their properties and achieve high gene delivery efficiency. Considering the tumor microenvironment as the ""regulator"" and ""target"" when designing gene carriers and choosing therapeutic genes shows significant benefit with respect to improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer gene therapy."

The development of a suitable gene delivery system is imperative to ensure the feasibility and viability of cancer gene therapy in a clinical setting. The conception of delivery systems based on cell- penetrating peptides may deeply contribute for the evolution of therapy efficacy. In this context, the present work explores the p53 encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensation ability of RALA peptide to produce a suitable intracellular delivery platform. These carriers, formed at several nitrogen to phosphate groups (N/P) ratio, were characterized in terms of morphology, size, surface charges, loading and complexation capacity and the fine structure has been analyzed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed intracellular localization of nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced sustained pDNA uptake. Moreover, in vitro transfection of HeLa cells mediated by RALA/pDNA vectors allows for gene release and p53 protein expression. From these progresses, apoptosis in cancer cells has been investigated. It was found that N/P ratio strongly tailors gene transfection efficiency and, thus, it can be fine-tuned for desired degree of both protein expression and apoptosis. The great asset of the proposed system relies precisely on the use of N/P ratio as a tailoring parameter that can not only modulate vector´s properties but also the extent of pDNA delivery, protein expression and, consequently, the efficacy of p53 mediated cancer therapy."

In the current study, shape-controlled magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) were prepared, and their performance in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided, magnetically targeted and hyperthermia-enhanced suicide gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated. Compared with sphere-like MSNs, rod-like MSNs exhibited higher loading capacity, faster prodrug release behavior, stronger magnetically enhanced gene delivery and better magnetic hyperthermia properties. Utilizing the improved magnetic properties of the M-MSNs allowed us to demonstrate highly effective dual magnetically enhanced suicide gene therapy in vivo with decreased systematic toxicity and with the ability to monitor therapeutic outcome by MRI. Because of their magnetic targeting abilities, magnetic hyperthermia performance and MRI properties, these M-MSNs might prove to be a potentially superior candidate for suicide gene therapy of HCC."

This neurological disorder is characterized by focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe, often with secondary generalization. A variety of pharmacological treatments exist for patients suffering from focal seizures, but systemically administered drugs offer only symptomatic relief and frequently cause unwanted side effects. Moreover, available drugs are ineffective in one third of the epilepsy patients. Thus, developing more targeted and effective treatment strategies for focal seizures, originating from, e.g., the temporal lobe, is highly warranted. In order to deliver potential anti-epileptic agents directly into the seizure focus we used encapsulated cell biodelivery (ECB), a specific type of ex vivo gene therapy. Specifically, we asked whether unilateral delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), exclusively into the epileptic focus, would suppress already established spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in rats. Our results show that GDNF delivered by ECB devices unilaterally into the seizure focus in the hippocampus effectively decreases the number of SRS in epileptic rats. Thus, our study demonstrates that focal unilateral delivery of neurotrophic factors, such as GDNF, using ex vivo gene therapy based on ECB devices could be an effective anti-epileptic strategy providing a bases for the development of a novel, alternative, treatment for focal epilepsies."

Since the beginning of gene therapy, hemophilia has been considered an attractive disease target that served as a trailblazer for the field at large. Different technologies have been explored to efficiently and safely deliver the therapeutic FVIII and FIX genes into the patients' cells. Currently, the most promising vectors for hemophilia gene therapy are adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) and lentiviral vectors. More recently, gene editing approaches based on designer nucleases or CRISPR/Cas, have also been considered to minimize risks associated with random vector integration and insertional mutagenesis though off-target issues would have to be carefully and comprehensively assessed. In the past two decades, several phase 1 hemophilia gene therapy clinical trials have been initiated with varying success. In particular, the early gene therapy clinical trials in hemophilia B patients based on AAV showed either transient or subtherapeutic clotting factor expression levels. This could be ascribed, at least in part, to suboptimal vector design and/or inadvertent immune consequences triggering hepatic inflammation. Hence, there was an unmet need to further increase vector safety and efficacy in future trials, preferably by using lower vector doses. It is particularly encouraging that sustained therapeutic FVIII and FIX expression levels have recently been attained after gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia paving the way towards pivotal trials and commercialization. Nevertheless, transient liver toxicity still occurs and the use of transient immunosuppression was still required to curtail inadvertent immune responses, especially at high vector doses. To further boost clotting factor expression levels, codon-usage optimized synthetic FVIII or FIX transgenes have been employed. Alternatively, we and others have shown that the incorporation of hyperactive gain-of-function R338L mutation in the FIX gene substantially increased the overall efficacy. It is inevitable that the continued improvements in vector engineering and new insights in the vector-patient interactions will further benefit the development of a safe and effective cure for hemophilia A and B."

Persons with hemophilia have bleeding episodes into the soft tissues and joints, which are treated with self-infusion of factor VIII or IX concentrates. Hemophilia provides an attractive target for gene therapy studies, due to the monogenic nature of these disorders and easily measurable endpoints (factor levels and bleed rates). All successful, pre-clinical and clinical studies to date have utilized recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for factor VIII or IX hepatocyte transduction. Recent clinical data have presented normalization of factor levels in some patients with improvements in bleed rate and quality of life. The main toxicity seen within these studies has been early transient elevation in liver enzymes, with variable effect on transgene expression. Although long-term data are awaited, durable expression has been seen within the hemophilia dog model with no late-toxicity or oncogenesis. There are a number of phase III studies currently recruiting; however, there may be some limitations in translating these data to clinical practice, due to inclusion/exclusion criteria. AAV-based gene therapy is one of a number of novel approaches for treatment of hemophilia with other gene therapy (in vivo and ex vivo) and non-replacement therapies progressing through clinical trials. Availability of these high-cost novel therapeutics will require evolution of both clinical and financial healthcare services to allow equitable personalization of care for persons with hemophilia."

Although RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool to stably inhibit HIV-1 replication by the expression of antiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in transduced T cells, this approach is also vulnerable to pre-existing genetic variation and the development of viral resistance through mutation. To prevent viral escape, we proposed to combine multiple shRNAs against important regions of the HIV-1 RNA genome, which should ideally be conserved in all HIV-1 subtypes. The vulnerability of RNAi therapy to viral escape has been studied for a single subtype B strain, but it is unclear whether the antiviral shRNAs can inhibit diverse virus isolates and subtypes, including drug-resistant variants that could be present in treated patients. To determine the breadth of the RNAi gene therapy approach, we studied the susceptibility of HIV-1 subtypes A-E and drug-resistant variants.

Currently, there is no therapy to address HCA/HCC in GSD-Ia. We have previously shown that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated G6PC gene transfer to 2-week-old G6pc-/- mice prevents HCA development. However, it remains unclear whether G6PC gene transfer at the tumor developing stage of GSD-Ia can prevent tumor initiation or abrogate the pre-existing tumors. Using liver-specific G6pc-knockout (L-G6pc-/-) mice that develop HCA/HCC, we now show that treating the mice at the tumor-developing stage with rAAV-G6PC restores hepatic G6Pase-α expression, normalizes glucose homeostasis, and prevents de novo HCA/HCC development. The rAAV-G6PC treatment also normalizes defective hepatic autophagy and corrects metabolic abnormalities in the nontumor liver tissues of both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. However, gene therapy cannot restore G6Pase-α expression in the HCA/HCC lesions and fails to abrogate any pre-existing tumors. We show that the expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 that mediates local glucocorticoid activation is downregulated in HCA/HCC lesions, leading to impairment in glucocorticoid signaling critical for gluconeogenesis activation. This suggests that local glucocorticoid action downregulation in the HCA/HCC lesions may suppress gene therapy mediated G6Pase-α restoration. Collectively, our data show that rAAV-mediated gene therapy can prevent de novo HCA/HCC development in L-G6pc-/- mice at the tumor developing stage, but it cannot reduce any pre-existing tumor burden."

A systematic review was conducted summarizing the articles reporting gene therapy in maxillofacial surgery to answer the question: Was gene therapy successfully applied to regenerate bone in the maxillofacial region? Electronic searching of online databases was performed in addition to hand searching of the references of included articles. No language or time restrictions were enforced. Meta-analysis was done to assess significant bone formation after delivery of gene material in the surgically induced maxillofacial defects. The search identified 2081 articles, of which 57 were included with 1726 animals. Bone morphogenetic proteins were commonly used proteins for gene therapy. Viral vectors were the universally used vectors. Sprague-Dawley rats were the frequently used animal model in experimental studies. The quality of the articles ranged from excellent to average. Meta-analysis results performed on 21 articles showed that defects favored bone formation by gene therapy. Funnel plot showed symmetry with the absence of publication bias. Gene therapy is on the top list of innovative strategies that developed in the last 10 years with the hope of developing a simple chair-side protocol in the near future, combining improvement of gene delivery as well as knowledge of the molecular basis of oral and maxillofacial structures."

Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic alternative, particularly in patients lacking an allogeneic bone marrow (BM) donor. One of the major challenges for an effective gene therapy approach is the design of an efficient vector that combines high-level and long-term β-globin expression with high infectivity in primary CD34+ cells. Two lentiviral vectors carrying an anti-sickling β-globin transgene (AS3) were directly compared: the Lenti/βAS3-FB, and Globe-AS3 with and without the FB insulator. The comparison was performed initially in human BM CD34+ cells derived from SCD patients in an in vitro model of erythroid differentiation. Additionally, the comparison was carried out in two in vivo models: First, an NOD SCID gamma mouse model was used to compare transduction efficiency and β-globin expression in human BM CD34+ cells after transplant. Second, a sickle mouse model was used to analyze β-globin expression produced from the vectors tested, as well as hematologic correction of the sickle phenotype. While minor differences were found in the vectors in the in vitro study (2.4-fold higher vector copy number in CD34+ cells when using Globe-AS3), no differences were noted in the overall correction of the SCD phenotype in the in vivo mouse model. This study provides a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo analysis of two globin lentiviral vectors, which is useful for determining the optimal candidate for SCD gene therapy."

Gene therapy products, a relatively new strategy for drug design with very few licensed examples, represent a unique challenge for the measure of potency. Unlike traditional drugs, potency for a gene therapeutic is a tally of the measures of multiple steps, including infectivity, transcription, translation, protein modifications, proper localization of the protein product, and protein function. This is particularly challenging for products based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, which has poor in vitro infectivity, limiting the sensitivity and thus the usefulness of cell-based assays. A rigorous in vivo assay has been established that separately evaluates infection, transcription, and resulting protein levels with specifications for each based on real time polymerase chain reaction (DNA and RNA) and standard protein assays. For an acceptance criterion, an administered vector must have vector DNA, transgene mRNA, and transgene expressed protein each concurrently meet individual specifications or the production lot fails. Using the AAVrh.10 serotype as a model vector and three different transgenes as examples, the assay is based on intravenous administration of the vector to male mice. At 2 weeks, the harvested liver is homogenized and assessed for vector genome levels (to assess for vector delivery), mRNA (to assess vector infectivity and transcription), and protein in the liver or serum (to assess protein expression).

This retrospective study analyzed the frequency and severity of pancreatitis in 19 patients with LPLD up to 6 years after a single treatment with alipogene tiparvovec. An independent adjudication board of three pancreas experts, blinded to patient identification and to pre- or post-gene therapy period, performed a retrospective review of data extracted from the patients' medical records and categorized LPLD-related acute abdominal pain events requiring hospital visits and/or hospitalizations based on the adapted 2012 Atlanta diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis. Both entire disease time period data and data from an equal time period before and after gene therapy were analyzed. Events with available medical record information meeting the Atlanta diagnostic criteria were categorized as definite pancreatitis; events treated as pancreatitis but with variable levels of laboratory and imaging data were categorized as probable pancreatitis or acute abdominal pain events. A reduction of approximately 50% was observed in all three categories of the adjudicated post-gene therapy events. Notably, no severe pancreatitis and only one intensive care unit admission was observed in the post-alipogene tiparvovec period. However, important inter- and intraindividual variations in the pre- and post-gene therapy incidence of events were observed. There was no relationship between the posttreatment incidence of events and the number of LPL gene copies injected, the administration of immunosuppressive regimen or the percent triglyceride decrease achieved at 12 weeks (primary end point in the prospective clinical studies). Although a causal relationship cannot be established and despite the limited number of individuals evaluated, results from this long-term analysis suggest that alipogene tiparvovec was associated with a lower frequency and severity of pancreatitis events, and a consequent overall reduction in health care resource use up to 6 years posttreatment."

The prognosis of AADC deficiency patients is poor, and most die in childhood. Gene therapy is the only method currently available to help alleviate related symptoms. Gene therapy involves the injection of adeno-associated viral (AV) vector into the basal ganglia of patients, helping transfer the AADC gene and leading to improved AADC production and higher numbers of neurotransmitters in the brain. Moreover, as patients are unable to produce catecholamine, they may also suffer from a disorder affecting the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in hypoglycemia, which often causes imbalances in thermoregulation and hemodynamic and functional adjustments during surgery. Furthermore, the use of analgesics and inhalational anesthetics increase the risks of hypotension and bradycardia. Thus, in addition to assessing cardiac and respiratory system functions, it is important to evaluate the patient's airway before administering anesthesia, as structural anomalies or other situations may be present that lead to difficulties in tracheal intubation. Various airway tools, anesthesia equipment, and alternative plans should thus be prepared to protect the airway and maintain vital signs. All of the abovementioned issues increase the risks of AADC deficiency patients undergoing general anesthesia. The development of gene transfection for genetic diseases is a future trend.

In this review, we summarize the key advancements in gene therapy for ED treatment, with an emphasis on the emerging stem cell-based approaches as well as other combinational strategies. The challenges facing the clinical application of gene therapy for ED treatment are also discussed."

Gendicine is a biological therapy that is delivered via minimally invasive intratumoral injection, as well as by intracavity or intravascular infusion. The wild-type (wt) p53 protein expressed by Gendicine-transduced cells is a tumor suppressor that is activated by cellular stress, and mediates cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair, or induces apoptosis, senescence, and/or autophagy, depending upon cellular stress conditions. Based on 12 years of commercial use in >30,000 patients, and >30 published clinical studies, Gendicine has exhibited an exemplary safety record, and when combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy has demonstrated significantly higher response rates than for standard therapies alone. In addition to head and neck cancer, Gendicine has been successfully applied to treat various other cancer types and different stages of disease. Thirteen published studies that include long-term survival data showed that Gendicine combination regimens yield progression-free survival times that are significantly longer than standard therapies alone. Although the p53 gene is mutated in >50% of all human cancers, p53 mutation status did not significantly influence efficacy outcomes and long-term survival rate for Ad-p53-treated patients.

This neuro-muscular disorder is caused by the loss or mutation of the telomeric copy of the 'survival of motor neuron' (Smn) gene, termed SMN1. Loss of SMN1 leads to reduced SMN protein levels, inducing degeneration of motor neurons (MN) and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Gene therapy, consisting of reintroducing SMN1 in the MNs, is an attractive approach for SMA. We showed the most efficient rescue of SMA mice to date after a single intravenous injection of an AAV9 expressing SMN1, highlighting the considerable potential of this method for the treatment of human SMA. Recently, a startup led by the Dr Kaspar decided to test this experimental approach in children with SMA type 1. Dr Mendell, in charge of this clinical project, showed a very significant increase of the lifespan and motor function of the patients (until 4 years) after a single injection of AAV9-SMN1 (named ZolgenSMA®) into an arm or leg vein.

Promising results were observed in the CUPID 1 trial, but the results of the CUPID 2 trial were negative. The factors that caused the controversial results remain unclear. Importantly, enrolled patients were required to have a higher plasma level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the CUPID 2 trial. Moreover, BNP was shown to inhibit SERCA2a expression. Therefore, it is possible that high BNP levels interact with treatment effects of SERCA2a gene transfer and accordingly lead to negative results of CUPID 2 trial. From this point of view, effects of SERCA2a gene therapy should be explored in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which is characterised by lower BNP levels compared with HFrEF.

Gene therapy by infusion of FA-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may offer a potential cure since it is a monogenetic disease with mutations in the FANC genes, coding for DNA repair enzymes [1]. However, the collection of hCD34+-cells in FA patients implies particular challenges because of the reduced numbers of progenitor cells present in their bone marrow (BM) [2] or mobilized peripheral blood [3-5]. In addition, the FA genetic defect fragilizes the HSCs [6]. These particular features might explain why the first clinical trials using murine leukemia virus derived retroviral vectors conducted for FA failed to show engraftment of corrected cells. The gene therapy field is now moving towards the use of lentiviral vectors (LVs) evidenced by recent succesful clinical trials for the treatment of patients suffering from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) [7], β-thalassemia [8], metachromatic leukodystrophy [9] and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [10]. LV trials for X-linked severe combined immunodificiency and Fanconi anemia (FA) defects were recently initiated [11, 12]. Fifteen years of preclinical studies using different FA mouse models and in vitro research allowed us to find the weak points in the in vitro culture and transduction conditions, which most probably led to the initial failure of FA HSC gene therapy. In this review, we will focus on the different obstacles, unique to FA gene therapy, and how they have been overcome through the development of optimized protocols for FA HSC culture and transduction and the engineering of new gene transfer tools for FA HSCs. These combined advances in the field hopefully will allow the correction of the FA hematological defect in the near future."

Although steady and substantial progress has been made in reducing mortality from heart failure using conventional treatments, novel pharmacologic and surgical interventions have not been effective in extending five year survival rates. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new therapies. Gene therapy was introduced in 1970s with the development of recombinant DNA technology. Due to recent progress in the understanding of myocardial metabolism and application of vector based gene transfer strategies in animal models and initial clinical trials, gene therapy possibly affords an ideal treatment alternative for CHF. In last 2 decades, much research has been done on gene therapy, using various genes, signal transduction passages and delivery methods to treat advanced heart failure. Current research in ischemic heart disease (IHD) mainly focuses on stimulating angiogenesis, modifying the coronary vascular environment, and improving the vascular endothelial function with localized gene coated catheters and stents. Compared with standard ischemic heart disease treatment, the main goal of gene therapy for CHF is to inhibit apoptosis, reduce the undesirable remodeling and increase contractility through the most efficient cardiomyocyte transfection [Katz 2012a]. In this paper, we review various gene transfer technologies in ischemic heart disease and heart failure models, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies in vector-mediated cardiac gene delivery, with the main focus on the high efficiency approach of a molecular cardiac surgery delivery system."

An example of this is the use of death‑induced gene therapy. This therapy consists of the killing of tumor cells via transfection with plasmid DNA (pDNA) that contains a gene which produces a protein that results in the apoptosis of cancerous cells. The cell death is caused by the direct activation of apoptosis (apoptosis‑induced gene therapy) or by the protein toxic effects (toxin‑induced gene therapy). The introduction of pDNA into the tumor cells has been a challenge for the development of this therapy. The most recent implementation of gene vectors is the use of polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles, which have biological and physicochemical properties (shape, size, surface charge, water interaction and biodegradation rate) that allow them to carry the pDNA into the tumor cell. Furthermore, nanoparticles may be functionalized with specific molecules for the recognition of molecular markers on the surface of tumor cells. The binding between the nanoparticle and the tumor cell induces specific endocytosis, avoiding toxicity in healthy cells. Currently, there are no clinical protocols approved for the use of nanoparticles in death‑induced gene therapy. There are still various challenges in the design of the perfect transfection vector, however nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be a suitable candidate. This review describes the role of nanoparticles used for pDNA transfection and key aspects for their use in death‑induced gene therapy."

In parallel, versions of adenoviral vector expressing the p53 gene (Ad-p53) have been tested as treatments for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Although Ad-p53 gene therapy has yielded some interesting results when applied to prostate cancer, it has not been widely explored, perhaps due to current limitations of the approach. To achieve better functionality, improvements in the gene transfer system and the therapeutic regimen may be required. We have developed adenoviral vectors whose transgene expression is controlled by a p53-responsive promoter, which creates a positive feedback mechanism when used to drive the expression of p53. Together with improvements that permit efficient transduction, this new approach was more effective than the use of traditional versions of Ad-p53 in killing prostate cancer cell lines and inhibiting tumor progression. Even so, gene therapy is not expected to replace traditional chemotherapy but should complement the standard of care. In fact, chemotherapy has been shown to assist in viral transduction and transgene expression. The cooperation between gene therapy and chemotherapy is expected to effectively kill tumor cells while permitting the use of reduced chemotherapy drug concentrations and, thus, lowering side effects. Therefore, the combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy may prove essential for the success of both approaches."

In this study, we developed gene therapies based on 3 longevity associated genes (fibroblast growth factor 21 [FGF21], αKlotho, soluble form of mouse transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 [sTGFβR2]) delivered using adeno-associated viruses and explored their ability to mitigate 4 age-related diseases: obesity, type II diabetes, heart failure, and renal failure. Individually and combinatorially, we applied these therapies to disease-specific mouse models and found that this set of diverse pathologies could be effectively treated and in some cases, even reversed with a single dose. We observed a 58% increase in heart function in ascending aortic constriction ensuing heart failure, a 38% reduction in α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression, and a 75% reduction in renal medullary atrophy in mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction and a complete reversal of obesity and diabetes phenotypes in mice fed a constant high-fat diet. Crucially, we discovered that a single formulation combining 2 separate therapies into 1 was able to treat all 4 diseases. These results emphasize the promise of gene therapy for treating diverse age-related ailments and demonstrate the potential of combination gene therapy that may improve health span and longevity by addressing multiple diseases at once."

Herein, we introduce a novel cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-based non-viral vector that utilises glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding enhanced transduction (GET) for highly efficient gene transfer. GET peptides couple directly with DNA through electrostatic interactions to form nanoparticles (NPs). In order to adapt the GET peptide for efficient in vivo delivery, we engineered PEGylated versions of the peptide and employed a strategy to form DNA NPs with different densities of PEG coatings. We were able to identify candidate formulations (PEGylation rates ≥40%) that shielded the positively charged surface of particles, maintained colloidal stability in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and retained gene transfer activity in human bronchial epithelial cell lines and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) in vitro. Using multiple particle tracking (MPT) technology, we demonstrated that PEG-GET complexes were able to navigate the mucus mesh and diffuse rapidly through patient CF sputum samples ex vivo. When tested in mouse lung models in vivo, PEGylated particles demonstrated superior biodistribution, improved safety profiles and efficient gene transfer of a reporter luciferase plasmid compared to non-PEGylated complexes. Furthermore, gene expression was significantly enhanced in comparison to polyethylenimine (PEI), a non-viral gene carrier that has been widely tested in pre-clinical settings. This work describes an innovative approach that combines novel GET peptides for enhanced transfection with a tuneable PEG coating for efficacious lung gene therapy."

Patients suffering from aging-associated illnesses often exhibit telomere attrition, which promotes chromosomal instability and cellular senescence, thus requiring the transfer of telomere maintenance-related genes to improve patient outcomes. However, reactivation and overexpression of telomerase are observed in 85% of cancer patients; this process is integral to cancer immortality. Thus, telomere-associated genes in the scope of cancer gene therapy must be inactivated or inhibited to induce anticancer effects. These contradicting requirements for achieving different therapeutic outcomes mean that any vector-mediated upregulation of telomere-associated genes must be accompanied by rigorous evaluation of potential oncogenesis.

The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) epigenome editing-based therapy for DDD, by modulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling in pathological human IVD cells. Human IVD cells from the nucleus pulposus of patients receiving surgery for back pain were obtained and the regulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling by a lentiviral CRISPR epigenome editing system was tested. These cells were tested for successful lentiviral transduction/expression of deactivated Cas9 fused to Krüppel Associated Box system and regulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 expression. TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling disruption was investigated through measurement of NF-κB activity, apoptosis, and anabolic/catabolic changes in gene expression postinflammatory challenge. CRISPR epigenome editing systems were effectively introduced into pathological human IVD cells and significantly downregulated TNFR1 and IL1R1. This downregulation significantly attenuated deleterious TNFR1 signaling but not IL1R1 signaling. This is attributed to less robust IL1R1 expression downregulation, and IL-1β-driven reversal of IL1R1 expression downregulation in a portion of patient IVD cells. In addition, RNAseq data indicated novel transcription factor targets, IRF1 and TFAP2C, as being primary regulators of inflammatory signaling in IVD cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR epigenome editing of inflammatory receptors in pathological IVD cells, but highlight a limitation in epigenome targeting of IL1R1.

Despite these apparently ideal circumstances, three HSC gene therapy trials with gammaretroviral vectors (stage I) designed to cure the hematological manifestation of FA completely failed to provide long-term clinical benefits for patients, predominantly due to the combination of insufficient gene transfer technologies and incompletely understood FA HSC pathobiology. Currently, FA gene therapy is in stage II where, based on an improved understanding of the cellular defects in FA HSCs, consequently adapted transduction protocols are being used in two phase I/II trials for in vitro genetic correction of FANCA-deficient hematopoietic stem cells. These results are eagerly awaited. Independent from the outcome of these studies, technologies are already available that seem highly attractive for testing in FA. In stage III, this would ultimately include targeted in vivo correction of autologous HSCs by overexpression of nonintegrating lentiviral vectors with scaffold/matrix attachment region elements using specific envelopes as pseudotypes. Although currently still challenging, in a few years in vivo genome editing approaches will be readily available in stage IV, in which the delivery of the editing machinery/ complex is targeted to the autologous FA HSCs by the nonintegrating lentiviral vectors established in stage III. Even low levels of corrected stem cells will then quickly repopulate the entire hematopoiesis of the patient.

Gene therapy approaches can permit cell-specific modification of neuronal and circuit excitability and have been investigated experimentally as a therapy for numerous neurological disorders, with clinical trials for several neurodegenerative diseases ongoing. Channelopathies can arise from a wide array of gene mutations; however they usually result in periods of aberrant network excitability. Therefore gene therapy strategies based on up or downregulation of genes that modulate neuronal excitability may be effective therapy for a wide range of neuronal channelopathies. As many channelopathies are paroxysmal in nature, optogenetic or chemogenetic approaches may be well suited to treat the symptoms of these diseases. Recent advances in gene-editing technologies such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system could in the future result in entirely novel treatment for a channelopathy by repairing disease-causing channel mutations at the germline level.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in fetomaternal tolerance and IDO gene therapy inhibits acute rejection following kidney transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether gene therapy with IDO is able to attenuate CTD. Transplantation was performed in a rat Dark-Agouti to Wistar-Furth CTD model. Donor kidneys were incubated either with an adenovirus carrying IDO gene, a control adenovirus or saline. During the first 10 days recipients received low-dose cyclosporine. Body weight, blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. Rats were killed after 12 weeks. IDO had a striking beneficial effect on transplant vasculopathy at week 12. It also significantly improved body weight gain; it reduced blood pressure and decreased proteinuria during the follow-up. However, it did not affect the kidney function. In addition, IDO therapy significantly decreased the number of graft-infiltrating macrophages at week 12. The messenger RNA levels of forkhead box p3 and transforming grow factor-β were elevated in the IDO treated group at week 12. Here we show for first time a clear beneficial effect of local IDO gene therapy especially on transplant vasculopathy in a rat model of renal CTD."

In this study, we engineered the deaminase domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) and the MS2 system to target-specific adenosines, with the goal of correcting G-to-A mutations at the RNA level. For this purpose, the ADAR1 deaminase domain was fused downstream of the RNA-binding protein MS2, which has affinity for the MS2 RNA. To direct editing to specific targets, we designed guide RNAs complementary to target RNAs. The guide RNAs directed the ADAR1 deaminase to the desired editing site, where it converted adenosine to inosine. To provide proof of principle, we used an allele of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) bearing a mutation at the 58th amino acid (TGG), encoding Trp, into an amber (TAG) or ochre (TAA) stop codon. In HEK-293 cells, our system could convert stop codons to read-through codons, thereby turning on fluorescence. We confirmed the specificity of editing at the DNA level by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing, and at the protein level by western blotting. The editing efficiency of this enzyme system was ~5%. We believe that this system could be used to treat genetic diseases resulting from G-to-A point mutations."

The disease is caused by deleterious mutations in the gene encoding argininosuccinate lyase (ASL); total loss of ASL activity results in severe neonatal onset of the disease, which is characterized by hyperammonemia within a few days of birth that can rapidly progress to coma and death. The long-term complications of ASA, such as hypertension and neurocognitive deficits, appear to be resistant to the current treatment options of dietary restriction, arginine supplementation, and nitrogen scavenging drugs. Treatment-resistant disease is currently being managed by orthotopic liver transplant, which shows variable improvement and requires lifetime immunosuppression. Here, we developed a gene therapy strategy for ASA aimed at alleviating the symptoms associated with urea cycle disruption by providing stable expression of ASL protein in the liver. We designed a codon-optimized human ASL gene packaged within adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) as a vector for targeted delivery to the liver. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this approach, we utilized a murine hypomorphic model of ASA. Neonatal administration of AAV8 via the temporal facial vein extended survival in ASA hypomorphic mice, although not to wild-type levels. Intravenous injection into adolescent hypomorphic mice led to increased survival and body weight and correction of metabolites associated with the disease. Our results demonstrate that AAV8 gene therapy is a viable approach for the treatment of ASA."

By harnessing the immune tolerance induction properties of the liver, liver-targeted gene delivery (with an adeno-associated virus vector containing a liver specific promoter), suppresses immunity against the GAA introduced by gene therapy. This induces immune tolerance to rhGAA by activating regulatory T cells and simultaneously, corrects GAA deficiency. Potentially, liver-targeted gene therapy can be performed once with lasting effects, by administering a relatively low dose of an adeno-associated virus type 8 vector to replace and induce immune tolerance to GAA."

The reported safety and efficacy of lentiviral vectors in preclinical studies have led to the development of several clinical trials for the addition of a functional beta-globin gene. Across trials, dozens of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) have been treated via gene therapy and have achieved reduced transfusion requirements. While overall results are encouraging, the outcomes appear to be strongly influenced by the level of lentiviral integration in transduced cells after engraftment, as well as the underlying genotype resulting in thalassemia. In addition, the method of procurement of hematopoietic stem cells can affect their quality and thus the outcome of gene therapy both in SCD and TDT. This suggests that new studies aimed at maximizing the number of corrected cells with long-term self-renewal potential are crucial to ensure successful treatment for every patient. Recent advancements in gene transfer and bone marrow transplantation have improved the success of this approach, and the results obtained by using these strategies demonstrated significant improvement of gene transfer outcome in patients. The advent of new gene-editing technologies has suggested additional therapeutic options. These are primarily focused on correcting the defective beta-globin gene or editing the expression of genes or genomic segments that regulate fetal hemoglobin synthesis.

The use of gene therapy has expanded from the original concept of re-placing the mutated gene causing the disease to the use of genes to con-trol nonphysiological levels of expression or to modify pathways known to affect the disease. Genes offer numerous advantages over conventional drugs. They have longer duration of action and are more specific. Genes can be delivered to the target site by naked DNA, cells, nonviral, and viral vectors. The enormous progress of the past decade in molecular bi-ology and delivery systems has provided ways for targeting genes to the intended cell/tissue and safe, long-term vectors. The eye is an ideal organ for gene therapy. It is easily accessible and it is an immune-privileged site. Currently, there are clinical trials for diseases affecting practically every tissue of the eye, including those to restore vision in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis. However, the number of eye trials compared with those for systemic diseases is quite low (1.8%). Nevertheless, judg-ing by the vast amount of ongoing preclinical studies, it is expected that such number will increase considerably in the near future.

In recent years, we and others have demonstrated the potential of poly(2‑(N,N'‑dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate) (PDMAEMA) as a gene therapy vehicle. Further optimization of gene transfer efficiency requires the understanding of the intracellular pathway of PDMAEMA. Therefore the goal of this study was to determine the cellular entry and intracellular trafficking mechanisms of our PDMAEMA vectors and determine the gene transfer bottleneck. For this, we have produced rhodamine-labeled PDMAEMA polyplexes that were used to transfect retinal cells and the cellular localization determined by co-localization with cellular markers. Our vectors quickly and efficiently cross the cell membrane, and escape the endo-lysosomal system by 24 h. We have observed the PDMAEMA vectors to concentrate around the nucleus, and the DNA load to be released in the first 24 h after transfection. These results allow us to conclude that although the endo-lysosomal system is an important obstacle, PDMAEMA gene vectors can overcome it. The nuclear membrane, however, constitutes the bottleneck to PDMAEMA gene transfer ability."

Multiple studies have independently explored the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in mouse models of RTT. Historically, the primary risk anticipated for viral vector-mediated MECP2 gene transfer in vivo has been toxicity caused by supraphysiological expression of exogenous MeCP2. Despite the anticipated risk, early studies examining AAV/MECP2 in vivo have, as a whole, supported a generally optimistic assessment of MECP2 gene therapy. More recently, toxicity assessments have identified dose-dependent side effects of AAV9/MECP2 delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ultimately, accurate monitoring and reporting of these side effects will help ensure the development of safe AAV/MECP2 treatment paradigms as researchers explore strategies to improve widespread but properly regulated MECP2 gene transfer in the central nervous system (CNS).

Nevertheless, some types of cancer contain a rare population of stem-like cells, capable of differentiation into tumor cells, promoting the re-incidence of tumors. Those cells are generally more resilient to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are related to tumor initiation, progression, recurrence and metastasis.

Conversely, it has some delivery challenges to the site of action within the cells of a target organ, due to the progress of nucleic acids engineering and advance material science research contributing to the exceptional organ-specific targeted therapy. This siRNA based therapeutic technique definitely favors a unique and effective prospect to cancer patients. Herein, the significant drive also takes to review and summarize the major organ specific targets of diverse siRNAs based gene silencing mechanism. This machinery promisingly served as the inhibitor components for cancer development in the human model. Furthermore, the focus is also given to current applications on siRNA based quantifiable therapy leading to the silencing of cancer related gene expression in a sequence dependent and selective manner for cancer treatment. That might be a potent tool against the traditional chemotherapy techniques. Therefore, the siRNA mediated cancer gene therapy definitely require sharp attention like future weapons in opposition to cancer by the method of non-invasive siRNA delivery and effective gene silencing approaches."

So far, there have been >2,400 gene therapy products in clinical trials and four products on the market. A prerequisite for producing gene therapy products is ensuring their quality and safety. This requires appropriately controlled and standardized production and testing procedures that result in consistent safety and efficacy. Assuring the quality and safety of lentivirus-based gene therapy products in particular presents a great challenge because they are cell-based multigene products that include viral and therapeutic proteins as well as modified cells. In addition to the continuous refinement of a product, changes in production sites and manufacturing processes have become more and more common, posing challenges to developers regarding reproducibility and comparability of results. This paper discusses the concept of developing a first World Health Organization International Standard, suitable for the standardization of assays and enabling comparison of cross-trial and cross-manufacturing results for this important vector platform. The standard will be expected to optimize the development of gene therapy medicinal products, which is especially important, given the usually orphan nature of the diseases to be treated, naturally hampering reproducibility and comparability of results."

However, due to inflammatory reactions at high vector doses, adjunctive treatment may be necessary to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have been successfully used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that at high concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can impact viral infection and replication by increasing endosomal and lysosomal pH. This effect has led to investigations into the potential benefits of these drugs in the treatment of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, at lower concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine appear to exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting nucleic acid sensors, including toll-like receptor 9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. This dose-dependent effect on their mechanism of action supports observations of increased viral infections associated with lower drug doses. In this review, we explore the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, their impact on viral infections, and their potential to improve the efficacy and safety of retinal gene therapy by reducing AAV-induced immune responses. The safety and practicalities of delivering hydroxychloroquine into the retina will also be discussed."

Gene therapy is an attractive tool for treatment of LSDs caused by deficiencies in secretable lysosomal enzymes, in which neither full restoration of normal enzymatic activity nor transduction of all cells of the affected organ is necessary. However, some LSDs, such as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPSIII) diseases or Sanfilippo syndrome, represent a difficult challenge because patients suffer severe neurodegeneration with mild somatic alterations. The disease's main target is the central nervous system (CNS) and enzymes do not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) even if present at very high concentration in circulation. No specific treatment has been approved for MPSIII. In this study, we discuss the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer strategies currently being developed for MPSIII disease. These strategies rely on local delivery of AAV vectors to the CNS either through direct intraparenchymal injection at several sites or through delivery to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the whole CNS, or exploit the properties of certain AAV serotypes capable of crossing the BBB upon systemic administration. Although studies in small and large animal models of MPSIII diseases have provided evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of all these strategies, there are considerable differences between the different routes of administration in terms of procedure-associated risks, vector dose requirements, sensitivity to the effect of circulating neutralizing antibodies that block AAV transduction, and potential toxicity. Ongoing clinical studies should shed light on which gene transfer strategy leads to highest clinical benefits while minimizing risks. The development of all these strategies opens a new horizon for treatment of not only MPSIII and other LSDs but also of a wide range of neurological diseases."

Conventional gene therapy strategies rely on the addition of a correct copy of the CFTR gene into affected cells in order to restore the channel activity. In recent years, genome correction strategies have emerged, such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated to Cas9 nucleases.

Herein, the use of human bone marrow MSC transiently transfected with minicircles encoding for VEGF is proposed as an ex vivo gene therapy strategy to enhance angiogenesis in PAD patients. The VEGF gene was cloned in minicircle and conventional plasmid vectors and used to transfect bone marrow-derived MSC ex vivo. VEGF expression was evaluated both by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The number of VEGF transcripts following MSC transfection with minicircles increased 130-fold relative to the expression in non-transfected MSC, whereas for the plasmid (pVAX1)-based transfection, the increase was 50-fold.

The presence of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses directed against the viral vector and/or the gene-modified cells, the insufficient gene expression levels, and the limited gene transduction efficiencies accounted for the overall limited clinical improvements. Nevertheless, further improvements of the gene delivery technology and a better understanding of the underlying biology fostered renewed interest in gene therapy for heart failure. In particular, improved vectors based on emerging cardiotropic serotypes of the adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) are particularly well suited to coax expression of therapeutic genes in the heart. This led to new clinical trials based on the delivery of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase protein (SERCA2a).

To help readers to grasp the essence and to better organize the diverse applications, we categorize them under four gene therapy strategies: (1) gene replacement therapy for monogenic diseases, (2) gene addition for complex disorders and infectious diseases, (3) gene expression alteration targeting RNA, and (4) gene editing to introduce targeted changes in host genome. Human gene therapy started with the simple idea that replacing a faulty gene with a functional copy can cure a disease. It has been a long and bumpy road to finally translate this seemingly straightforward concept into reality. As many disease mechanisms unraveled, gene therapists have employed a gene addition strategy backed by a deep knowledge of what goes wrong in diseases and how to harness host cellular machinery to battle against diseases. Breakthroughs in other biotechnologies, such as RNA interference and genome editing by chimeric nucleases, have the potential to be integrated into gene therapy. Although clinical trials utilizing these new technologies are currently sparse, these innovations are expected to greatly broaden the scope of gene therapy in the near future. "

Plasmids (non-viral expression vectors) and adenovirus (viral vectors) were the most employed vectors in preclinical studies. Genes delivered encoded mainly for growth factors, followed by transcription factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines and, less frequently, by cell signalling proteins, matrix proteins and receptors. Direct injection of the expression vector was used less than indirect injection of cells, with or without scaffolds, transduced with genes of interest and then implanted into the lesion site. Clinical trials (phases I, II or III) on safety, biological activity, efficacy, toxicity or bio-distribution employed adenovirus viral vectors to deliver growth factors or anti-inflammatory cytokines, for the treatment of osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis, and tumour necrosis factor receptor or interferon for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis."

The approach involves treatment of patients suffering from SMN1-associated infantile form of the disease with a splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that corrects aberrant splicing of the nearly identical SMN2 gene to allow the generation of functional SMN protein, thereby mitigating the development of the disease. This technique represents the first apparently effective therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and an important documentation for ASO technology for therapy of neurodegenerative disease. These results with one form of SMA are likely to be relevant for similar applications to other SMA types and are likely to inspire application to a number of other intractable neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and possibly even the extremely common Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and others. Nevertheless, the scientific and medical importance of this advance is marred by a pricing policy by the corporate sponsors that may complicate accessibility of the drug for some desperate patients."

Native FGF21 has, however, poor pharmacokinetic properties, making gene therapy an attractive strategy to achieve sustained circulating levels of this protein. Here, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) were used to genetically engineer liver, adipose tissue, or skeletal muscle to secrete FGF21. Treatment of animals under long-term high-fat diet feeding or of ob/ob mice resulted in marked reductions in body weight, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, and insulin resistance for > 1 year. This therapeutic effect was achieved in the absence of side effects despite continuously elevated serum FGF21. Furthermore, FGF21 overproduction in healthy animals fed a standard diet prevented the increase in weight and insulin resistance associated with aging.

Despite neurosurgical repair, recovery of function in human patients is disappointing, because spinal motor neurons degenerate progressively, axons grow slowly and the distal Schwann cells which are instrumental to supporting axon extension lose their pro-regenerative properties. We have recently shown that timed GDNF gene therapy (dox-i-GDNF) in a lumbar plexus injury model promotes axon regeneration and improves electrophysiological recovery but fails to stimulate voluntary hind paw function. Here we report that dox-i-GDNF treatment following avulsion and re-implantation of cervical ventral roots leads to sustained motoneuron survival and recovery of voluntary function. These improvements were associated with a twofold increase in motor axon regeneration and enhanced reinnervation of the hand musculature. In this cervical model the distal hand muscles are located 6,5 cm from the reimplantation site, whereas following a lumber lesion this distance is twice as long. Since the first signs of muscle reinnervation are observed 6 weeks after the lesion, this suggests that regenerating axons reached the hand musculature before a critical state of chronic denervation has developed. These results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of timed GDNF-gene therapy are more robust following spinal nerve avulsion lesions that allow reinnervation of target muscles within a relatively short time window after the lesion. This study is an important step in demonstrating the potential of timed GDNF-gene therapy to enhance axon regeneration after neurosurgical repair of a severe proximal nerve lesion."

The HSC compartment has also been successfully targeted using gene transfer in children with genetic diseases affecting the central nervous system, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and adrenoleukodystrophy. HSCs are also a target for genetic modification in strategies aiming to confer drug resistance to chemotherapy agents so as to reduce off-target toxicity, and to allow for chemotherapy dose escalation with the possibility of enhanced therapeutic benefit. In a trial of this strategy in adult glioma patients, significant engraftment of gene-modified HSCs expressing a mutant of the DNA repair protein O6-methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT(P140K)) showed potential in conferring drug resistance against the combined effect of O6-benzylguanine (O6BG)/temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The aim was to test the safety and feasibility of this approach in children with poor prognosis brain tumors. In this Phase I trial, seven patients received gene-modified HSC following myelo-suppressive conditioning, but with only transient low-level engraftment of MGMT(P140K) gene-modified cells detectable in four patients. All patients received O6BG/TMZ chemotherapy following infusion of gene-modified cells, with five patients eligible for chemotherapy dose escalation, though in the absence of demonstrable transgene-mediated chemoprotection. Since all gene-modified cell products met the criteria for release and assays for engraftment potential met expected outcome measures, inadequate cell dose, conditioning chemotherapy, and/or underlying bone-marrow function may have contributed to the lack of sustained engraftment of gene-modified cells. We were able to demonstrate safe conduct of a technically complex Phase I study encompassing manufacture of the gene therapy vector, genetically modified cells, and a drug product specifically for the trial in compliance with both local and national regulatory requirements."

Examples for these are the positive recommendation for a gene therapy product (Glybera) by the EMA for approval in the European Union and the positive trials for the treatment of ADA deficiency, SCID-X1 and adrenoleukodystrophy. Nevertheless, our knowledge continues to grow and during the course of time more safety data has become available that helps us to develop better gene therapy approaches. Also, with the increased understanding of molecular medicine, we have been able to develop more specific and efficient gene transfer vectors which are now producing clinical results. In this review, we will take a historical view and highlight some of the milestones that had an important impact on the development of gene therapy. We will also discuss briefly the safety and ethical aspects of gene therapy and address some concerns that have been connected with gene therapy as an important therapeutic modality. "

Researchers and pharma companies have started to target the processes and cells known to support immune surveillance and the elimination of tumor cells. Immune processes, however, require novel concepts beyond the traditional ""single-target-single drug"" paradigm and need parallel targeting of diverse cells and mechanisms.

Intravenous ERT is able to control the damage of visceral organs but cannot prevent nervous impairment. Depending on the disease type, HSCT has important limitations when performed for early variants, unless treatment occurs before disease onset.

In particular, the use of autologous haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced with a viral vector containing a healthy copy of the mutated gene would allow supra-normal production of the defective enzyme and cross correction of target cells in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system.

The prelude to successful gene therapy i.e. the efficient transfer and expression of a variety of human gene into target cells has already been accomplished in several systems. Safe methods have been devised to do this, using several viral and no-viral vectors. Two main approaches emerged: in vivo modification and ex vivo modification. Retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus are suitable for gene therapeutic approaches which are based on permanent expression of the therapeutic gene. Non-viral vectors are far less efficient than viral vectors, but they have advantages due to their low immunogenicity and their large capacity for therapeutic DNA. To improve the function of non-viral vectors, the addition of viral functions such as receptor mediated uptake and nuclear translocation of DNA may finally lead to the development of an artificial virus. Gene transfer protocols have been approved for human use in inherited diseases, cancers and acquired disorders. In 1990, the first successful clinical trial of gene therapy was initiated for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Since then, the number of clinical protocols initiated worldwide has increased exponentially. Although preliminary results of these trials are somewhat disappointing, but human gene therapy dreams of treating diseases by replacing or supplementing the product of defective or introducing novel therapeutic genes. So definitely human gene therapy is an effective addition to the arsenal of approaches to many human therapies in the 21st century."

One such IRD for which gene therapy has shown positive initial results is choroideremia, a rare, X-linked degenerative disorder of the retina and choroid. Mutation of the CHM gene leads to an absence of functional Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), which causes retinal pigment epithelium cell death and photoreceptor degeneration. The condition presents in childhood as night blindness, followed by progressive constriction of visual fields, generally leading to vision loss in early adulthood and total blindness thereafter. A recently developed adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2) vector construct encoding REP1 (AAV2-REP1) has been shown to deliver a functional version of the CHM gene into the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. Phase 1 and 2 studies of AAV2-REP1 in patients with choroideremia have produced encouraging results, suggesting that it is possible not only to slow or stop the decline in vision following treatment with AAV2-REP1, but also to improve visual acuity in some patients."

Finally, we describe the development of a stem cell-based lentiviral vector gene therapy product that has the potential to provide lifelong production of FVIII and provide a functional 'cure' for haemophilia A. Integral to this program has been the incorporation of a blood cell-specific gene expression element driving the production of a bioengineered FVIII designed for optimal efficiency.

IFN gene therapy counteracts leukemia-induced expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and imposes an immunostimulatory program to the TME, as shown by bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses. This reprogramming promotes T-cell priming and effector function against multiple surrogate tumor-specific antigens, inhibiting leukemia growth in our experimental model. Durable responses are observed in a fraction of mice and are further increased combining gene therapy with checkpoint blockers. Furthermore, IFN gene therapy strongly enhances anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells engineered with tumor-specific TCR or CAR, overcoming suppressive signals in the leukemia TME.

The hemophilias are ideally suited for gene therapy because a small increment in blood factor levels (≥5% of normal) is associated with significant amelioration of bleeding phenotype in severely affected patients. In 2011, the St. Jude/UCL phase 1/2 trial was the first to provide clear evidence of a stable dose-dependent increase in FIX levels in patients with severe hemophilia B following a single administration of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Transgenic FIX expression has remained stable at ∼5% of normal in the high-dose cohort over a 7-year follow-up period, resulting in a substantial reduction in spontaneous bleeding and FIX protein usage without toxicity. This study has been followed by unparalleled advances in gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, leading to clotting factor activity approaching normal or near-normal levels associated with a ""zero bleed rates"" in previously severely affected patients following a single administration of AAV vectors.

Co-localization of proangiogenic factors and hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) in neovascular membranes from AMD eyes suggests the role of hypoxia in pathogenesis of CNV. In order to utilize hypoxic conditions in RPE for therapeutic purposes, we developed an optimized hypoxia regulated, RPE cell-specific gene therapy to inhibit choroidal neovascularization. An adeno-associated virus (AAV2) vector comprising a RPE-specific promoter and HIF-1 response elements (HRE) was designed to regulate production of human endostatin (a powerful angiostatic protein) in RPE. The vector was tested in a mouse model of laser-induced CNV using subretinal delivery. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images from live mice and confocal images from lectin stained RPE flat mount sections demonstrated reduction in CNV areas by 80% compared to untreated eyes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed exogenous endostatin mRNA expression from the regulated vector that was significantly elevated 3, 7, and 14 days following laser treatment, but its expression was completely shut off after 45 days. Thus, RPE-specific, hypoxia-regulated delivery of anti-angiogenic proteins could be a valuable therapeutic approach to treat neovascular AMD at the time and in the ocular space where it arises."

However, efficient vector targeting to tumors is difficult and off-target effects can be severely detrimental. Most vector targeting approaches rely on surface receptors overexpressed on some subpopulation of cancer cells. Unfortunately, there is no universally expressed cell surface biomarker for tumor cells. As an alternative, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based ""Provector"" whose cellular transduction can be activated by extracellular proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that are overexpressed in the tumor microenvironments of the most aggressive forms of EOC. In a non-tumor bearing mouse model, the Provector demonstrates efficient de-targeting of healthy tissues, especially the liver, where viral delivery is <1% of AAV2. In an orthotopic HeyA8 tumor model of EOC, the Provector maintains decreased off-target delivery in the liver and other tissues but with no loss in tumor delivery. Notably, approximately 10% of the injected Provector is still detected in the blood at 24 h while >99% of injected AAV2 has been cleared from the blood by 1 h. Furthermore, mouse serum raised against the Provector is 16-fold less able to neutralize Provector transduction compared to AAV2 serum neutralizing AAV2 transduction (1:200 vs 1:3200 serum dilution, respectively). Thus, the Provector appears to generate less neutralizing antibodies than AAV2. Importantly, serum against AAV2 does not neutralize the Provector as well as AAV2, suggesting that pre-existing antibodies against AAV2 would not negate the clinical application of Provectors. Taken together, we present an EOC gene delivery vector platform based on AAV with decreased off-target delivery without loss of on-target specificity, and greater immunological stealth over the traditional AAV2 gene delivery vector."

Cx47 is expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes and is crucial for gap junctional communication throughout the central nervous system. Previous studies confirmed that a cell autonomous loss-of-function mechanism underlies hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-2 and that transgenic oligodendrocyte-specific expression of another connexin, Cx32 (GJB1), can restore gap junctions in oligodendrocytes to achieve correction of the pathology in a disease model. To develop an oligodendrocyte-targeted gene therapy, we cloned the GJC2/Cx47 gene under the myelin basic protein promoter and used an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV.MBP.Cx47myc) to deliver the gene to postnatal Day 10 mice via a single intracerebral injection in the internal capsule area. Lasting Cx47 expression specifically in oligodendrocytes was detected in Cx47 single knockout and Cx32/Cx47 double knockout mice up to 12 weeks post-injection, including the corpus callosum and the internal capsule but also in more distant areas of the cerebrum and in the spinal cord. Application of this oligodendrocyte-targeted somatic gene therapy at postnatal Day 10 in groups of double knockout mice, a well characterized model of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-2, resulted in significant improvement in motor performance and coordination at 1 month of age in treated compared to mock-treated mice, as well as prolonged survival. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and morphological analysis revealed improvement in demyelination, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, inflammation, and astrogliosis, all typical features of this leukodystrophy model in both brain and spinal cord. Functional dye transfer analysis confirmed the re-establishment of oligodendrocyte gap junctional connectivity in treated as opposed to untreated mice.

Adeno-associated viral vectors can be used to target therapeutic expression of a myelin gene to oligodendrocytes.

However, the actions of endogenous IL-10 may be required for enduring pain control observed following i.t. IL-10 gene therapy, potentially narrowing the application of this non-viral transgene delivery approach. Here, we show that i.t. application of naked plasmid DNA expressing the IL-10 transgene co-injected with DM (DM/pDNA-IL-10) for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in IL-10 deficient (IL-10 KO) mice results in a profound and prolonged bilateral pain suppression. Neuropathic pain is induced by unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury (CCI), and while enduring relief of light touch sensitivity (mechanical allodynia) in both wild type (WT) and IL-10 KO mice was observed following DM/pDNA-IL-10 co-therapy, transient reversal from allodynia was observed following i.t. DM alone. In stably pain-relieved IL-10 KO mice given DM/pDNA-IL-10, mRNA for the IL-10 transgene is detected in the cauda equina and ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but not the lumbar spinal cord. Further, DM/pDNA-IL-10 application increases anti-inflammatory TGF-β1 and decreases pro-inflammatory TNF mRNA in the ipsilateral DRG compared to allodynic controls. Additionally, DM/pDNA-IL-10 treated mice exhibit decreased spinal pro-inflammatory mRNA expression for TNF, CCL2 (MCP-1), and for the microglial-specific marker TMEM119. Similarly, DM/pDNA-IL-10 treatment decreases immunoreactivity for the astrocyte activation marker GFAP in lumbar spinal cord dorsal horn. Despite transient reversal and early return to allodynia in DM-treated mice, lumbar spinal cord revealed elevated TNF, CCL2 and TMEM119 mRNA levels. Both MR (CD206) and IL-10 receptor mRNAs are increased in the DRG following CCI manipulation independent of injection treatment, suggesting that pathological conditions stimulate upregulation and availability of relevant receptors in critical anatomical regions required for the therapeutic actions of the DM/pDNA-IL-10 co-therapy. Taken together, the current report demonstrates that non-viral DM/pDNA-IL-10 gene therapy does not require endogenous IL-10 for enduring relief of peripheral neuropathic pain and does not require direct contact with the spinal cord dorsal horn for robust and enduring relief of neuropathic pain. Spinal non-viral DM/pDNA-IL-10 co-therapy may offer a framework for the development of non-viral gene therapeutic approaches for other diseases of the central nervous system."

Even so, additional improvements are needed, such as employing a strategically chosen promoter to drive expression of the transgene in the target cell. Previously, we described viral vectors where high-level transgene expression was achieved using a p53-responsive promoter. Here we present an adenoviral vector (AdPGp53) where p53 is employed to regulate its own expression and which outperforms a traditional vector when tested in a model of gene therapy for prostate cancer. The functionality of AdPGp53 and AdCMVp53 were compared in human prostate carcinoma cell lines. AdPGp53 conferred greatly enhanced levels of p53 protein and induction of the p53 target gene, p21, as well as superior cell killing by a mechanism consistent with apoptosis. DU145 cells were susceptible to induction of death with AdPGp53, yet PC3 cells were quite resistant. Though AdCMVp53 was shown to be reliable, extremely high-level expression of p53 offered by AdPGp53 was necessary for tumor suppressor activity in PC3 and DU145. In situ gene therapy experiments revealed tumor inhibition and increased overall survival in response to AdPGp53, but not AdCMVp53. Upon histologic examination, only AdPGp53 treatment was correlated with the detection of both p53 and TUNEL-positive cells. This study points to the importance of improved vector performance for gene therapy of prostate cancer."

Despite remarkable improvements in medical care for patients with β-hemoglobinopathies, there is still only one definitive treatment option: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The development of gene therapy for β-hemoglobinopathies has been justified by (1) the limited availability of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donors, (2) the narrow window of application of HSC transplantation to the youngest patients, and (3) recent advances in HSC-based gene therapy. The huge ongoing efforts in translational medicine and the high number of related publications show that gene therapy has the potential to become the treatment of choice for patients who lack either an HLA genoidentical sibling or an alternative, medically acceptable donor. In this dynamic scientific context, we first summarize the main steps toward clinical translation of this therapeutic approach and then discuss novel lentiviral- and genome editing-based treatment strategies for β-hemoglobinopathies."

The success of surgery is critical for the clinical efficacy of retinal gene therapy. Iatrogenic detachment of the degenerate (often adherent) retina in patients with hereditary retinal degenerations and small volume (eg, 0.1 ml) subretinal injections pose new surgical challenges.MethodsOur subretinal gene therapy technique involved pre-operative planning with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and autofluorescence (AF) imaging, 23 G pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane staining with Membrane Blue Dual (DORC BV, Zuidland, Netherlands), a two-step subretinal injection using a 41 G Teflon tipped cannula (DORC) first with normal saline to create a parafoveal bleb followed by slow infusion of viral vector via the same self-sealing retinotomy. Surgical precision was further enhanced by intraoperative OCT (Zeiss Rescan 7000, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). Foveal functional and structural recovery was evaluated using best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity, microperimetry and OCT.ResultsTwo patients with choroideremia aged 29 (P1) and 27 (P2) years, who had normal and symmetrical levels of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in both eyes, underwent unilateral gene therapy with the fellow eye acting as internal control. The surgeries were uncomplicated in both cases with successful detachment of the macula by subretinal vector injection. Both treated eyes showed recovery of BCVA (P1: 76-77 letters; P2: 84-88 letters) and mean threshold sensitivity of the central macula (P1: 10.7-10.7 dB; P2: 14.2-14.1 dB) to baseline within a month. This was accompanied by normalisation of central retinal thickness on OCT.ConclusionsHerein we describe a reliable technique for subretinal gene therapy, which is currently used in clinical trials to treat choroideremia using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding the CHM gene. Strategies to minimise potential complications, such as avoidance of excessive retinal stretch, air bubbles within the injection system, reflux of viral vector and post-operative vitritis are discussed."

Viral vectors have been extensively tested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationic polymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfection efficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{ N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} (PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA (PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed much fewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviral vectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantages and may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example, intraperitoneal cancer therapy."

The disorder has a complex pathophysiology that affects multiple organ systems. The main complications of beta thalassemia are ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia and hemosiderosis-induced organ dysfunction. Regular blood transfusions are the main therapy for beta thalassemia major; however, this treatment can cause cardiac and hepatic hemosiderosis - the most common cause of death in these patients. This review focuses on unique future therapeutic interventions for thalassemia that reverse splenomegaly, reduce transfusion frequency, decrease iron toxicity in organs, and correct chronic anemia. The targeted effective protocols include hemoglobin fetal inducers, ineffective erythropoiesis correctors, antioxidants, vitamins, and natural products. Resveratrol is a new herbal therapeutic approach which serves as fetal Hb inducer in beta thalassemia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for beta thalassemia major and is preferred over iron chelation and blood transfusion for ensuring long life in these patients. Meanwhile, several molecular therapies, such as ActRIIB/IgG1 Fc recombinant protein, have emerged to address complications of beta thalassemia or the adverse effects of current drugs. Regarding gene correction strategies, a phase III trial called HGB-207 (Northstar-2; NCT02906202) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of autologous cell transplantation with LentiGlobin. Advanced gene-editing approaches aim to cut DNA at a targeted site and convert HbF to HbA during infancy, such as the suppression of BCL11A (B cell lymphoma 11A), HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) and zinc-finger nucleases. Gene therapy is progressing rapidly, with multiple clinical trials being conducted in many countries and the promise of commercial products to be available in the near future."

Cell and gene therapy strategies are connected with human pathologies at a fundamental level, by delivering DNA and RNA molecules that could correct and/or ameliorate the underlying genetic factors of any illness. The history of HIV gene therapy is especially intriguing, in that the virus that was targeted was soon co-opted to become part of the targeting strategy. Today, HIV-based lentiviral vectors, along with many other gene delivery strategies, have been used to evaluate HIV cure approaches in cell culture, small and large animal models, and in patients. Here, we trace HIV cell and gene therapy from the earliest clinical trials, using genetically unmodified cell products from the patient or from matched donors, through current state-of-the-art strategies. These include engineering HIV-specific immunity in T-cells, gene editing approaches to render all blood cells in the body HIV-resistant, and most importantly, combination therapies that draw from both of these respective ""offensive"" and ""defensive"" approaches. It is widely agreed upon that combinatorial approaches are the most promising route to functional cure/remission of HIV infection. This chapter outlines cell and gene therapy strategies that are poised to play an essential role in eradicating HIV-infected cells in vivo."

Despite the economic and health impacts, current medical therapies are targeted at symptomatic relief of OA and fail to alter its progression. Given the complexity of OA pathogenesis, we hypothesized that a combinatorial gene therapy approach, designed to inhibit inflammation with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) while promoting chondroprotection using lubricin (PRG4), would improve preservation of the joint compared to monotherapy alone. Employing two surgical techniques to model mild, moderate and severe posttraumatic OA, we found that combined delivery of helper-dependent adenoviruses (HDVs), expressing IL-1Ra and PRG4, preserved articular cartilage better than either monotherapy in both models as demonstrated by preservation of articular cartilage volume and surface area. This improved protection was associated with increased expression of proanabolic and cartilage matrix genes together with decreased expression of catabolic genes and inflammatory mediators. In addition to improvements in joint tissues, this combinatorial gene therapy prolonged protection against thermal hyperalgesia compared to either monotherapy. Taken together, our results show that a combinatorial strategy is superior to monotherapeutic approaches for treatment of posttraumatic OA."

Their low immunogenicity, tissue tropism, and relative safety due to their low rate of genomic integration represent key features, making rAAVs promising instruments as vectors for future gene therapy approaches. Specifically, for cardiovascular gene therapy, rAAVs appear superior to other vector systems such as lenti- and adenoviral vectors due to the ease of accomplishing long-term cardiac expression of target genes and the reduced risk of provoking immune responses or triggering malignancies through genomic integration. However, major obstacles remain to be resolved if rAAVs are to achieve their full potential as gene therapy vectors in clinical trials. The main hurdles prohibiting their sustained success are their limited capacity to carry transgenes of larger sizes, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in the general population, and their tissue specificity, which leaves room for improvement.

This information led to new molecular diagnostic strategies for inherited disorders of hemostasis and the development of recombinant clotting factors for the treatment of the common inherited bleeding disorders. A longer term goal of this knowledge has been the establishment of gene transfer to provide continuing access to missing or defective hemostatic proteins. Because of the relative infrequency of inherited coagulation factor disorders and the availability of safe and effective alternative means of management, the application of gene therapy for these conditions has been slow to realize clinical application. Nevertheless, the tools for effective and safe gene transfer are now much improved, and we have started to see examples of clinical gene therapy successes. Leading the way has been the use of adeno-associated virus-based strategies for factor IX gene transfer in hemophilia B. Several small phase 1/2 clinical studies using this approach have shown prolonged expression of therapeutically beneficial levels of factor IX. Nevertheless, before the application of gene therapy for coagulation disorders becomes widespread, several obstacles need to be overcome. Immunologic responses to the vector and transgenic protein need to be mitigated, and production strategies for clinical grade vectors require enhancements. There is little doubt that with the development of more efficient and facile strategies for genome editing and the application of other nucleic acid-based approaches to influence the coagulation system, the future of genetic therapies for hemostasis is bright.

For this purpose, we harvested bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) twice in the same animal before (non-diabetic BMSCs; nBMSCs) and after diabetes induction (diabetic BMSCs; dBMSCs) using modified bone marrow ablation methods. And then, cells were transduced by adenoviral vectors carrying the BMP2 gene (AdBMP2). In in vitro, AdBMP2-transfected dBMSCs (B2/dBMSCs) produced higher BMP-2 mRNA levels over 48 h, whereas AdBMP2-transfected nBMSCs (B2/nBMSCs) exhibited a transient increase in BMP-2 mRNA followed by a decrease to the baseline level within 48 h. Both B2/dBMSCs and B2/nBMSCs induced secretion of BMP-2 for 3 weeks. However, B2/dBMSC BMP-2 secretion peaked from day 3 to 10, whereas B2/nBMSC BMP-2 secretion peaked from day 1 to 7. The analysis of osteogenic activity revealed that mineralization nodule formation and the expression levels of osteogenic genes were significantly higher in B2/dBMSCs than B2/nBMSCs and were accompanied by upregulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin and Smad signaling. AdBMP2-transfected autologous cells were implanted into critical-sized calvarial defects in diabetic animals and induced significantly more bone regeneration than non-AdBMP2-transfected cells. In addition, B2/dBMSCs led to significantly more new bone formation than B2/nBMSCs. Thus, BMP2 gene therapy using diabetic cells effectively supported diabetic bone healing and it was related to the enhanced responses to AdBMP2 of dBMSCs."

The principal concept of gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. Although gene therapy was originally conceived as a way to treat life-threatening disorders (inborn defects, cancers) refractory to conventional treatment, it is now considered for many nonlife-threatening conditions, such as those adversely impacting a patients quality of life. An extensive range of efficacious vectors, delivery techniques, and approaches for developing gene-based interventions for diseases have evolved in the last decade. The lack of suitable treatment has become a rational basis for extending the scope of gene therapy. The aim of this review is to investigate the general methods by which genes are transferred and to give an overview to clinical applications. Maximizing the potential benefits of gene therapy requires efficient and sustained therapeutic gene expression in target cells, low toxicity, and a high safety profile. Gene therapy has made substantial progress albeit much slower than was initially predicted. This review also describes the basic science associated with many gene therapy vectors and the present progress of gene therapy carried out for various surface disorders and diseases. The conclusion is that, with increased pathobiological understanding and biotechnological improvements, gene therapy will become a standard part of clinical practice. "

Immunotherapeutic approaches that harness the cytotoxic and memory potential of the host immune system have shown great benefit in other cancers. GBMs have developed multiple strategies, including the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to induce immunosuppression. It is therefore imperative to develop multipronged approaches when aiming to generate a robust anti-tumor immune response. Herein, we tested whether combining MDSC depletion or checkpoint blockade would augment the efficacy of immune-stimulatory herpes simplex type-I thymidine kinase (TK) plus Fms-like tyrosine kinase ligand (Flt3L)-mediated immune stimulatory gene therapy. Our results show that MDSCs constitute >40% of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells. These cells express IL-4Rα, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), arginase, programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1), and CD80, molecules that are critically involved in antigen-specific T cell suppression. Depletion of MDSCs strongly enhanced the TK/Flt3L gene therapy-induced tumor-specific CD8 T cell response, which lead to increased median survival and percentage of long-term survivors. Also, combining PDL1 or CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade greatly improved the efficacy of TK/Flt3L gene therapy. Our results, therefore, indicate that blocking MDSC-mediated immunosuppression holds great promise for increasing the efficacy of gene therapy-mediated immunotherapies for GBM."

These current treatment options are suboptimal at best, motivating research into discovering more effective and innovative ways to treat AF. Gene therapy is being explored for its potential to treat various human conditions including cardiac arrhythmias. Gene transfer vectors with increasing transduction efficiency and biosafety have been developed and trialled for cardiovascular disease treatment. With an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AF, several gene therapy targets have been identified and evaluated in an attempt to rate or rhythm control the heart during AF.

Although promising momentum supports the potential of gene therapy to replace protein-based therapeutics for hemophilia, several obstacles remain. The largest challenges appear to be overcoming the cellular immune responses to the AAV capsid; preexisting AAV neutralizing antibodies, which immediately exclude approximately 50% of the target population; and the ability to scale-up vector manufacturing for widespread applicability. Additional obstacles specific to hemophilia A (HA) include designing a vector cassette to accommodate a larger cDNA; avoiding development of inhibitory antibodies; and, perhaps the greatest difficulty to overcome, ensuring adequate expression efficiency.

The rationale for the latter approach is that brain microglia are derived from hematopoietic cells. Thus, gene-corrected hematopoietic cells migrate into the brain and differentiate into microglial cells. These gene-corrected microglial cells correct the metabolic defects associated with LSD and reduce inflammation in PD and LSD, leading to a clinical benefit.

Previous studies indicate that CI stimulation can ameliorate SG neural degeneration after deafness, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) delivered by an osmotic pump can further improve neural survival. However, direct infusion of BDNF elicits undesirable side effects, and osmotic pumps are impractical for clinical application. In this study, we explored the potential for two adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) to elicit targeted neurotrophic factor expression in the cochlea and promote improved SG and radial nerve fiber survival. Juvenile cats were deafened prior to hearing onset by systemic aminoglycoside injections. Auditory brainstem responses showed profound hearing loss by 16-18 days postnatal. At ~ 4 weeks of age, AAV2-GFP (green fluorescent protein), AAV5-GFP, AAV2-hBDNF, or AAV5-hGDNF (glial-derived neurotrophic factor) was injected through the round window unilaterally. For GFP immunofluorescence, animals were studied ~ 4 weeks post-injection to assess cell types transfected and their distributions. AAV2-GFP immunofluorescence demonstrated strong expression of the GFP reporter gene in residual inner (IHCs), outer hair cells (OHCs), inner pillar cells, and in some SG neurons throughout the cochlea. AAV5-GFP elicited robust transduction of IHCs and some SG neurons, but few OHCs and supporting cells. After AAV-neurotrophic factor injections, animals were studied ~ 3 months post-injection to evaluate neural survival. AAV5-hGDNF elicited a modest neurotrophic effect, with 6 % higher SG density, but had no trophic effect on radial nerve fiber survival, and undesirable ectopic fiber sprouting occurred. AAV2-hBDNF elicited a similar 6 % increase in SG survival, but also resulted in greatly improved radial nerve fiber survival, with no ectopic fiber sprouting. A further study assessed whether AAV2-hBDNF neurotrophic effects would persist over longer post-injection periods. Animals examined 6 months after virus injection showed substantial neurotrophic effects, with 14 % higher SG density and greatly improved radial nerve fiber survival. Our results suggest that AAV-neurotrophin gene therapy can elicit expression of physiological concentrations of neurotrophins in the cochlea, supporting improved SG neuronal and radial nerve fiber survival while avoiding undesirable side effects. These studies also demonstrate the potential for application of cochlear gene therapy in a large mammalian cochlea comparable to the human cochlea and in an animal model of congenital/early acquired deafness."

In order to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment option, nAb titers were measured in both healthy individuals and Sjögren's patients. Several serotypes with known transduction activity in mouse salivary glands were tested and only AAV5 showed a statistically significant change in the prevalence of nAbs between Sjögren's and healthy participants. Both groups showed a higher rate of nAbs for AAV2 compared with most of the other serotypes tested, except for bovine AAV (BAAV). Although a similar rate of seropositivity was seen against BAAV and AAV2, the percentage of samples with high titer was significantly lower with BAAV. Furthermore, the majority of positive samples exhibited low nAb titers in the primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) group for all serotypes except for AAV2. AAV5 was the only serotype that showed a statistically significant shift in the percentage of medium or high neutralizing titer. Based on these results, many serotypes are viable vectors in a gene therapy approach and pSS patients do not have a statistically significant higher rate of seropositivity or titer compared with healthy donors."

We recently developed an adipocyte-targeting recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector with minimal off-target transgene expression in the liver. Here, we used this rAAV system to deliver an IL-15/IL-15Rα complex to the abdominal fat by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.

The i.p. injection of rAAV-IL-15/IL-15Rα complex significantly suppressed the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma implanted subcutaneously and exerted a significant survival advantage in a B16-F10 melanoma metastasis model. The antitumor effects were associated with the expansion of the NK cells in the blood, spleen, abdominal fat, and tumor, as well as the enhancement of NK cell maturity.

It consists in the insertion of genetic material in a defective tissue or cell, through the use of a vector. There are several considerations for selecting the most appropriate vector, including the potential for binding and entry to the target cell, the ability of the genetic material to transfer to the nucleus, the ability to express the insert, and the absence of toxicity. In the current scenario, the most commonly used viral vectors are those derived from adeno-associated viruses (AAV). Characteristics such as biosafety, low toxicity and selective tropism have enabled its evaluation as a therapeutic option in many monogenic or complex diseases. Despite their advantages, AAV vectors have drawbacks, the most important being the patient's immune response to the vector, especially the response mediated by neutralizing antibodies (NAb). NAbs decrease the transduction of the vector and prevent the expression of the gene it transports, limiting its clinical application. Therefore, identifying and quantifying the presence and activity of NAbs is the first step in any gene therapy protocol with AAV vectors. The presence of NAbs depends mainly on exposure to the virus in nature and varies drastically according to age, geographic location and health status of the person evaluated."

However, in order to adapt regional gene therapy for clinical applications, it is essential to assess the osteogenic capacity of transduced human cells and choose the cell type that demonstrates the best clinical potential. Bone-marrow stem cells (BMSC) and adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) were selected in this study for in vitro evaluation, before and after transduction with a lentiviral two-step transcriptional amplification system (TSTA) overexpressing bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2; LV-TSTA-BMP-2) or green fluorescent protein (GFP; LV-TSTA-GFP). Cell growth, transduction efficiency, BMP-2 production, and osteogenic capacity were assessed. The study demonstrated that BMSC were characterized by a slower cell growth compared to ASC. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of GFP-transduced cells confirmed successful transduction with the vector and revealed an overall higher but not statistically significant transduction efficiency in ASC versus BMSC (90.2 ± 4.06% vs. 80.4 ± 8.51%, respectively; p = 0.146). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed abundant BMP-2 production by both cell types transduced with LV-TSTA-BMP-2, with BMP-2 production being significantly higher in ASC versus BMSC (239.5 ± 116.55 ng vs. 70.86 ± 24.7 ng; p = 0.001). Quantitative analysis of extracellular deposition of calcium (Alizarin red) and alkaline phosphatase activity showed that BMP-2-transduced cells had a higher osteogenic differentiation capacity compared to non-transduced cells. When comparing the two cell types, ASC/LV-TSTA-BMP-2 demonstrated a significantly higher mineralization potential compared to BMSC/LV-TSTA-BMP-2 7 days post transduction (p = 0.014). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that transduction with LV-TSTA-BMP-2 can significantly enhance the osteogenic potential of both human BMSC and ASC. BMP-2-treated ASC exhibited higher BMP-2 production and greater osteogenic differentiation capacity compared to BMP-2-treated BMSC. These results, along with the fact that liposuction is an easy procedure with lower donor-site morbidity compared to BM aspiration, indicate that adipose tissue might be a preferable source of MSCs to develop a regional gene therapy approach to treat difficult bone-repair scenarios."

Even more strikingly, three articles in the issue 6271 of Science in 2016 provide new insights into gene therapy of DMD and BMD via the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). In brief, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors transport guided RNAs (gRNAs) and Cas9 into mdx mouse model, gRNAs recognize the mutated Dmd exon 23 (having a stop codon), and Cas9 cut the mutated exon 23 off the Dmd gene. These manipulations restored expression of truncated but partially functional dystrophin, improved skeletal and cardiac muscle function, and increased survival of mdx mice significantly. This review concisely summarized the related advancements and discussed their primary implications in the future gene therapy of DMD, including AAV-vector selection, gRNA designing, Cas9 optimization, dystrophin-restoration efficiency, administration routes, and systemic and long-term therapeutic efficacy. Future orientations, including off-target effects, safety concerns, immune responses, precision medicine, and Dmd-editing in the brain (potentially blocked by the blood-brain barrier) were also elucidated briefly.

With the increasing insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of ocular diseases, gene therapy has been proposed as an effective approach. Successful gene therapy depends on efficient gene transfer to targeted cells to prove stable and prolonged gene expression with minimal toxicity. At present, the main hindrance regarding the clinical application of gene therapy is not the lack of an ideal gene, but rather the lack of a safe and efficient method to selectively deliver genes to target cells and tissues. Ultrasound‑targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD), with the advantages of high safety, repetitive applicability and tissue targeting, has become a potential strategy for gene‑ and drug delivery. When gene‑loaded microbubbles are injected, UTMD is able to enhance the transport of the gene to the targeted cells. High‑amplitude oscillations of microbubbles act as cavitation nuclei which can effectively focus ultrasound energy, produce oscillations and disruptions that increase the permeability of the cell membrane and create transient pores in the cell membrane. Thereby, the efficiency of gene therapy can be significantly improved. The UTMD‑mediated gene delivery system has been widely used in pre‑clinical studies to enhance gene expression in a site‑specific manner in a variety of organs. With reasonable application, the effects of sonoporation can be spatially and temporally controlled to improve localized tissue deposition of gene complexes for ocular gene therapy applications. In addition, appropriately powered, focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles can induce a reversible disruption of the blood‑retinal barrier with no significant side effects.

Bi-allelic mutations of the CPS1 gene result in a urea cycle disorder presenting with hyperammonemia, often with reduced citrulline, and without orotic aciduria. CPS1 deficiency is particularly challenging to treat and lack of early recognition typically results in early neonatal death. Therapeutic interventions have limited efficacy and most patients develop long-term neurologic sequelae. Using transgenic techniques, we generated a conditional Cps1 knockout mouse. By loxP/Cre recombinase technology, deletion of the Cps1 locus was achieved in adult transgenic animals using a Cre recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viral vector. Within four weeks from vector injection, all animals developed hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria and died. Minimal CPS1 protein was detectable in livers. To investigate the efficacy of gene therapy for CPS deficiency following knock-down of hepatic endogenous CPS1 expression, we injected these mice with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd) expressing the large murine CPS1 cDNA under control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. Liver-directed HDAd-mediated gene therapy resulted in survival, normalization of plasma ammonia and glutamine, and 13% of normal Cps1 expression. A gender difference in survival suggests that female mice may require higher hepatic CPS1 expression. We conclude that this conditional murine model recapitulates the clinical and biochemical phenotype detected in human patients with CPS1 deficiency and will be useful to investigate ammonia-mediated neurotoxicity and for the development of cell- and gene-based therapeutic approaches."

Here, we generated human iPSC (hiPSC) clones via reprogramming of skin fibroblasts derived from normal donors and patients affected by metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease caused by genetic defects of the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) enzyme. We differentiated hiPSCs into NSCs (hiPS-NSCs) sharing molecular, phenotypic, and functional identity with hfNSCs, which we used as a ""gold standard"" in a side-by-side comparison when validating the phenotype of hiPS-NSCs and predicting their performance after intracerebral transplantation. Using lentiviral vectors, we efficiently transduced MLD hiPSCs, achieving supraphysiological ARSA activity that further increased upon neural differentiation. Intracerebral transplantation of hiPS-NSCs into neonatal and adult immunodeficient MLD mice stably restored ARSA activity in the whole central nervous system. Importantly, we observed a significant decrease of sulfatide storage when ARSA-overexpressing cells were used, with a clear advantage in those mice receiving neonatal as compared with adult intervention. Thus, we generated a renewable source of ARSA-overexpressing iPSC-derived bona fide hNSCs with improved features compared with clinically approved hfNSCs.

Using optical coherence tomography, a widely applied noninvasive method for monitoring retinal structure changes, we analyzed retinal optical sections from six mouse lines with retinal degeneration caused by mutations in different disease-causing genes. While images from wild-type mice revealed four well-separated hyper-reflective bands in the outer retina (designated as outer retina reflective bands, ORRBs) at all ages, the second band (ORRB2) and the third band (ORRB3) were merged in retinas of five mutant mouse lines at early ages, suggesting the pathological nature of this alteration. This ORRB change appeared to be degenerating photoreceptor related, and occurred before obvious morphological changes that can be identified on both hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and electron microscopic sections. Importantly, the merging of ORRB2 and ORRB3 was reversed by treatment with adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene replacement therapies, and this restoration occurred much earlier than measurable functional or structural improvement. Our data suggest that the ORRB change could be a common hallmark of early retinal degeneration and its restoration could be used for rapid and noninvasive assessment of therapeutic effects following gene therapy or other treatment interventions."

The Rpe65-deficient dog is a very useful pre-clinical model in which to test efficacy of therapies, because the dog has a retina with a high degree of similarity to that of humans. In this study, we evaluated the effect of RPE65 gene therapy on photoreceptor survival in order to predict the potential benefit and limitations of therapy in patients. We examined the retinas of Rpe65-deficient dogs after RPE65 gene therapy to evaluate the preservation of rods and cone photoreceptor subtypes. We found that gene therapy preserves both rods and cones. While the moderate loss of rods in the Rpe65-deficient dog retina is slowed by gene therapy, S-cones are lost extensively and gene therapy can prevent that loss, although only within the treated area. Although LM-cones are not lost extensively, cone opsin mislocalization indicates that they are stressed, and this can be partially reversed by gene therapy. Our results suggest that gene therapy may be able to slow cone degeneration in patients if intervention is sufficiently early and also that it is probably important to treat the macula in order to preserve central function."

Inhaled AAV2-CFTR in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is safe, but inefficient. In vitro, AAV2 transduction of human airway epithelia on the apical (luminal) side is inefficient, but efficient basolaterally. We previously selected AAV2.5T, a novel capsid that apically transduces CF human airway epithelia and efficiently restores CFTR function. We hypothesize the AAV receptor (AAVR) is basolaterally localized, and that AAV2.5T utilizes an alternative apical receptor. We found AAVR in human airway epithelia by western blot and RNA-Seq analyses. Using immunocytochemistry we did not find endogenous AAVR at membranes but overexpression localized AAVR to the basolateral membrane, where it preferentially increased transduction. Anti-AAVR antibodies blocked transduction by AAV2 from the basolateral side but not AAV2.5T from the apical side, suggesting a unique apical receptor. Finally, we found infection by AAV2 but not AAV2.5T was blocked by CRISPR knockout of AAVR in cell lines. Our data suggest the absence of apical AAVR is rate limiting for AAV2, and efficient transduction by AAV2.5T is accomplished using an AAVR independent pathway.

The delivery of the clotting factor genes into the patients' cells could be accomplished using different types of gene delivery vehicles or vectors. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) and lentiviral vectors represent some of the most promising gene delivery technologies that allow for a relatively efficient delivery of the therapeutic FVIII and FIX transgenes into the relevant target cells. To reduce the risks associated with insertional mutagenesis due to random vector integration, gene-editing approaches have also been considered based primarily on zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) and CRISPR/Cas. However, comprehensive analysis of off-target effects is still required. It is particularly encouraging that relatively stable therapeutic FVIII or FIX expression levels were reached in severe haemophilia patients in recent clinical trials after liver-directed AAV gene therapy. This success could be ascribed in part to improvements in vector design. In particular, clotting factor levels could be increased by codon optimization of coagulation factor transgenes. Alternatively, incorporation of a hyperactive gain-of-function R338L mutation (FIX Padua) in the FIX gene improved the overall efficacy. However, some patients still show transient liver toxicity, especially at high vector doses, possibly due to inflammatory immune responses, requiring the need for transient immunosuppression. The exact immune mechanisms are not fully understood, but may at least in some patients involve an AAV-capsid specific T cell response. Moreover, there is a need to identify the key factors that contribute to the interpatient variability in therapeutic efficacy and safety after gene therapy."

Depending on the LLCI degree and the method of treatment, during 3 years we assessed such parameters as the limb salvage rate, pain-free walk distance (PFWD), ankle-brachial index (ABI) and linear blood velocity (LBV). An increase in the PFWD in patients with initial stage IIB LLCI in the group of gene therapy was considerably higher than in other types of treatment (p=0.0001-0.0004). Using indirect methods of revascularization was accompanied and followed by less positive alterations in the PFWD values which by the end of the third year of follow up were observed to decrease. The values of PFWD after ROT at 2 and 3 years were higher than after LSE (p=0.006). During the first year of follow up the highest increment of the ABI was observed after ROT. At two years, the ABI values after ROT and gene therapy became equal. The worst result during 3 years as compared with other methods of treatment was demonstrated by LSE (p=0.006). Changes in ABI after gene therapy were statistically significant at all terms of follow up (p=0.008-0.02).

29938706,,Hot News: Hepatitis B Gene Therapy Coming to Age.,2018,AIDS Rev,,['Vicente Soriano'],[],"The major pandemics caused by chronic viral infections is produced by HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), with estimates of 38, 70, and 250 million people worldwide, respectively (Fig. 1). During the last couple of years, the advent of direct oral antivirals has allowed pursuing global HCV eradication. In an unprecedented manner, these drugs cure more than 95% of hepatitis C patients when given for only 2-3 months. The enthusiasm on HCV has renewed the interest for curative strategies for both HIV and HBV. However, important biological differences between all three viruses may preclude envisioning a similar rapid success for either HIV or HBV than for HCV infection. As shown in figure 1, once infection of targeted cells has occurred, the viral genetic material only replicates in the cytosol for HCV whereas it enters the nucleus and integrates into the chromosomes as provirus for HIV or is converted in a circular covalently closed form (cccDNA) for HBV (Fig. 1). Blocking viral nucleic acid replication for a minimum lag of time allows definitive clearance of HCV infection, with degradation of residual cytoplasmic HCV-RNA strands. In contrast, blocking viral replication has only a transient effect on HIV or HBV, as mRNA expression resumes following treatment discontinuation, given the stability of the HIV provirus or the HBV cccDNA, respectively. The European Liver meeting took held in Paris on April 2018. A relatively large number of presentations addressed distinct new hepatitis B therapeutic strategies. Table 1 summarizes some of the molecules that have been investigated so far with more promising results, grouping them into distinct drug classes (Soriano et al. Exp Op Inv Drugs 2017;26:843-51), based on their distinct mechanism of action and targeted steps in the HBV life cycle (Fig. 2). Considering the pros and cons of novel HBV therapeutic candidates, it has become apparent new HBV gene therapies among the most attractive. Several advances have contributed to position gene therapy in front within the experimental HBV armamentarium. First, progresses in delivery systems, including the use of polymers and nanoformulations have allowed developing easier forms of administration that now are becoming subcutaneous and monthly. Second, the synthetic production of oligonucleotide formulations has reduced costs. Third, the specificity against HBV is higher than for other experimental agents, as immune modulators that enhance innate immunity, such as TLR agonists (i.e., GS-9620) or checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., nivolumab). Fourth, significant declines in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are demonstrated during gene therapy, which have never been seen using the most potent polymerase inhibitors (i.e., tenofovir or entecavir). Finally, unanticipated significant reductions in cccDNA are seen with HBV gene therapy, most likely as prove of an indirect benefit of waning the immunosuppressive effect of large over amounts of HBsAg released by infected hepatocytes that contributes to T-cell exhaustion. In a pioneering study, Roche was the first to publish the potent effect of an oral small molecule that blocked HBV gene expression (Mueller et al. J Hepatol 2018;68:412-20). The drug belonged to the dihydroquinolizinone class, and directly or indirectly modified viral RNAs, promoting their degradation. This posttranscriptional silencing was accompanied by rapid drops in HBV-DNA and more importantly in serum HBsAg in the humanized mice. However, Roche decided to discontinue any further clinical development of the drug. Nowadays, two major groups of agents are being developed as HBV gene therapies. At this time, interference RNA (iRNA) molecules and nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) are the most promising. Overall, iRNA is double-stranded RNA molecules, 20 nucleotides long. One strand matches a segment of specific HBV mRNA and induces its degradation. Several iRNA molecules have entered into Phase II clinical trials (Flisiak et al. Exp Op Biol Ther, in press), including ARB-1467 and AB-729 (Arbutus), ARO-HBV (Arrowhead), ALN-HBV (Alnylam), and IONIS-HBVRx (Ionis). In most cases, they are tested as part of combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs and/or peginterferon. NAPs are phosphorothioate 40 length oligonucleotides that no map any HBV sequence. However, they interact with a liver host target protein (apolipoprotein-like) and result in specific inhibition of HBV mRNAs. This is followed by rapid suppression of HBsAg release (Roehl et al. Mol Ther Nuc Acids 2017;8:1-12). In a pilot study with intravenous REP-2139, investigators from Replicor demonstrated strong reductions in HBV-DNA along with significant drops in HBsAg and seroconversion in some patients. More interestingly was the recognition of significant reductions in hepatic cccDNA, most likely a result of an indirect effect following the removal of large amounts of HBsAg from the bloodstream that contributes to impaired T-cell responses in chronic hepatitis B patients (Bazinet et al. EASL, Paris 2018; abstract FRI-343). An improved NAP, named REP-2165 and subcutaneous administration are currently being tested."

Their capacity for proliferation and differentiation, in addition to their immunomodulatory activity, makes them very promising candidates for cell-based regenerative medicine. Moreover, MSCs have the ability of mobilization to the site of damage; therefore, they can automatically migrate to the site of injury via their chemokine receptors following intravenous transplantation. In this respect, they can be applied for MSC-based gene therapy. In this new therapeutic method, genes of interest are introduced into MSCs via viral and non-viral-based methods that lead to transgene expression in them.

We identified major strain-specific contributions to overall success of transduction, vector biodistribution, maximum luciferase expression, and the kinetics of luciferase expression throughout the study. Our results highlight the importance of genetic variation on gene-therapeutic efficacy; provide new models with which to more rigorously assess gene therapy approaches; and suggest that redesigning preclinical studies of gene-therapy methodologies might be appropriate."

Recent data from a handful of patients who have undergone gene therapy for hemophilia B are very encouraging with a sustained factor IX (FIX) level of 0.05 IU/mL maintained for over 4 years. While this level is above the current usual target trough levels, it falls well short of the level that patients on prophylaxis with longer-acting products can expect. Prophylaxis is also associated with high peak levels, which permits patients to maintain an active lifestyle. A major barrier to widespread adoption of gene therapy is a high seroprevalence of antibodies to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in the general population. Young children would be the best candidates for gene therapy in view of much lower seroprevalence to AAV in infants. A stable level of FIX early in life would prevent the onset of joint bleeds and the development of arthropathy. The recent experience with apolipoprotein tiparvovec (Glybera; uniQure, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) indicates that gene therapy is unlikely to prove to be a cheap therapeutic option. It is also quite possible that other new technologies that do not require viral vectors (such as stem cell therapy) may overtake gene therapy during development and make it redundant. "

However, individuals with pre-existing immunity to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) may be less likely to benefit from AAV vector-based therapies. To study pre-existing AAV5 immunity in humans, we validated two complementary, sensitive, and scalable in vitro assays to detect AAV5 total antibodies and transduction inhibition (TI). Using these two assays, we found that 53% of samples from 100 healthy male individuals were negative in both assays, 18% were positive in both assays, 5% were positive for total antibodies but negative for TI and, of interest, 24% were negative for total antibodies but positive for TI activity, suggesting the presence of non-antibody-based neutralizing factors in human plasma. Similar findings were obtained with 24 samples from individuals with hemophilia A. On the basis of these results, we describe the development of a dual-assay strategy to identify individuals without total AAV5 antibodies or neutralizing factors who may be more likely to respond to AAV5-directed gene therapy. These assays offer a universal, transferrable platform across laboratories to assess the global prevalence of AAV5 antibodies and neutralizing factors in large patient populations to help inform clinical development strategies."

Recent preclinical research demonstrates that treatment of the inner ear with a variety of compounds, including gene therapy agents, may elicit regeneration and/or repair of hair cells in animals exposed to ototoxic medications or other insults to the inner ear. Delivery of gene therapy may also offer a means for treatment of hereditary hearing loss. However, injection of a fluid volume sufficient to deliver an adequate dose of a pharmacologic agent could, in theory, cause inner ear trauma that compromises functional outcome. The primary goal of the present study was to assess that risk in rhesus monkeys, which closely approximates humans with regard to middle and inner ear anatomy. Secondary goals were to identify the best delivery route into the primate ear from among two common surgical approaches (i.e., via an oval window stapedotomy and via the round window) and to determine the relative volumes of rhesus, rodent, and human labyrinths for extrapolation of results to other species. We measured hearing and vestibular functions before and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after unilateral injection of phosphate-buffered saline vehicle (PBSV) into the perilymphatic space of normal rhesus monkeys at volumes sufficient to deliver an atoh1 gene therapy vector. To isolate effects of injection, PBSV without vector was used. Assays included behavioral observation, auditory brainstem responses, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and scleral coil measurement of vestibulo-ocular reflexes during whole-body rotation in darkness. Three groups (N = 3 each) were studied. Group A received a 10 μL transmastoid/trans-stapes injection via a laser stapedotomy. Group B received a 10 μL transmastoid/trans-round window injection. Group C received a 30 μL transmastoid/trans-round window injection. We also measured inner ear fluid space volume via 3D reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images of adult C57BL6 mouse, rat, rhesus macaque, and human temporal bones (N = 3 each). Injection was well tolerated by all animals, with eight of nine exhibiting no signs of disequilibrium and one animal exhibiting transient disequilibrium that resolved spontaneously by 24 h after surgery. Physiologic results at the final, 8-week post-injection measurement showed that injection was well tolerated. Compared to its pretreatment values, no treated ear's ABR threshold had worsened by more than 5 dB at any stimulus frequency; distortion product otoacoustic emissions remained detectable above the noise floor for every treated ear (mean, SD and maximum deviation from baseline: -1.3, 9.0, and -18 dB, respectively); and no animal exhibited a reduction of more than 3 % in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during high-acceleration, whole-body, passive yaw rotations in darkness toward the treated side. All control ears and all operated ears with definite histologic evidence of injection through the intended site showed similar findings, with intact hair cells in all five inner ear sensory epithelia and intact auditory/vestibular neurons. The relative volumes of mouse, rat, rhesus, and human inner ears as measured by CT were (mean ± SD) 2.5 ± 0.1, 5.5 ± 0.4, 59.4 ± 4.7 and 191.1 ± 4.7 μL. These results indicate that injection of PBSV at volumes sufficient for gene therapy delivery can be accomplished without destruction of inner ear structures required for hearing and vestibular sensation."

Gene therapy for neurotrophic factors is a powerful strategy to promote axon regeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene therapy promotes motor neuron survival and axon outgrowth; however, uncontrolled delivery of GDNF results in axon entrapment. We report that time-restricted GDNF expression (1 month) using an immune-evasive doxycycline-inducible gene switch attenuated local axon entrapment in avulsed reimplanted ventral spinal roots, was sufficient to promote long-term motor neuron survival (24 weeks) and facilitated the recovery of compound muscle action potentials by 8 weeks. These improvements were associated with an increase in long-distance regeneration of motor axons. In contrast, persistent GDNF expression impaired axon regeneration by inducing axon entrapment. These findings demonstrate that timed expression can resolve the deleterious effect of uncontrolled growth factor delivery and shows that inducible growth factor gene therapy can be employed to enhance the efficacy of axon regeneration after neurosurgical repair of a proximal nerve lesion in rats. This preclinical study is an important step in the ongoing development of a neurotrophic factor gene therapy for patients with severe proximal nerve lesions."

Like all other genetic materials, these vehicles are also prone to spontaneous mutations. To understand what types of nucleotide mutations are expected in the vector, one needs to know distinct characteristics of mutational process in the corresponding virus. In this study we analyzed mutational pressure directions along the length of the genomes of all types of primate adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are frequently used in gene therapy or DNA-vaccines. We observed clear evidences of transcription-associated mutational pressure in AAV: nucleotide usage biases are changing drastically after each of the three promoters: the higher the rate of transcription, the stronger the bias towards GC to AT mutations. Moreover, the usage of G decreased at the lower transcription rate (after P19 promoter) than the usage of C (after P40 promoter). Since nucleotide usage biases are retrospective indices, we created a scenario of changes in transcriptional map during the AAV evolution. Current mutational pressure directions are different for AAV types, while all of them demonstrate high rates of T to C transitions in the second long ORF. Since transcription rate and cell tropism are the main factors determining the preferable direction of nucleotide mutations in AAV, mutational pressure should be checked experimentally in DNA vectors before their final design with the aim to make the transferred gene more stable against those mutations."

Cancer is a complex disease, which strongly depends on a particular genetic make-up and hence can be treated with gene therapy. From about 2,000 clinical trials carried out so far, more than 60% were cancer targeted. Development of precise and effective gene therapy approaches is intimately connected with achievements in the molecular biology techniques. The field of gene therapy was recently revolutionized by the introduction of ""programmable"" nucleases, including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR, which target specific genomic loci with high efficacy and precision. Furthermore, when combined with DNA transposons for the delivery purposes into cells, these programmable nucleases represent a promising alternative to the conventional viral-mediated gene delivery. In addition to ""programmable"" nucleases, a new class of TALE- and CRISPR-based ""artificial transcription effectors"" has been developed to mediate precise regulation of specific genes. In sum, these new molecular tools may be used in a wide plethora of gene therapy strategies. This review highlights the current status of novel genome editing tools and discusses their suitability and perspectives in respect to cancer gene therapy studies. "

Gene therapy might be the ultimate strategy for the disease. However, two main problems that should be solved in gene therapy for hemophilia B are immunity and safety. Self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (scAAV8), a non-human primate AAV featuring low immunogenicity and high transfection efficiency in liver cells, might be a potential vector for hemophilia B gene therapy. A strong liver-specific promoter-1 (LP1) was inserted and mutant human FIX Arg338Ala was introduced into plasmid scAAV8-LP1 to develop an optimized AAV8 vector that expresses human clotting factor FIX (hFIX). The efficiency of scAAV8-LP1-hFIX administered through normal systemic injection or hydrodynamic injection was compared. A high expression was achieved using hydrodynamic injection, and the peak hFIX expression levels in the 5 × 10(11) and 1 × 10(11) virus genome (vg) cohorts were 31.94% and 25.02% of normal level, respectively, at 60 days post-injection. From the perspective of long-term (200 days) expression, both injection methods presented promising results with the concentration value maintained above 4% of normal plasma. The results were further verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and activated partial thromboplastin time. Our study provides a potential gene therapy method for hemophilia B. "

Gene therapy is a powerful tool with the potential to inhibit the deleterious effects of oncogenes by inserting corrected/normal genes into the genome. Both viral and non-viral vector-based gene therapies have been developed and adopted to deliver the target genes into neuroblastoma cells. These attempts have given hope to bringing in a new regime of treatment against neuroblastoma. A few gene-therapy-based treatment strategies have been tested in limited clinical trials yielding some positive results. This mini review is an attempt to provide an overview of the available options of gene therapy to treat neuroblastoma."

Conventional therapy requires frequent intravenous infusions of the missing coagulation protein (factor VIII [FVIII] for hemophilia A and factor IX [FIX] for hemophilia B). However, a lasting cure through gene therapy has long been sought. After a series of successes in small and large animal models, this goal has finally been achieved in humans by in vivo gene transfer to the liver using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. In fact, multiple recent clinical trials have shown therapeutic, and in some cases curative, expression. At the same time, cellular immune responses against the virus have emerged as an obstacle in humans, potentially resulting in loss of expression. Transient immune suppression protocols have been developed to blunt these responses. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical development of AAV gene transfer for hemophilia, as well as an outlook on future directions."

ADA-SCID is fatal early in life if untreated. Unconditioned hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant from matched sibling donor represents a curative treatment but is available for few patients. Enzyme replacement therapy can be life-saving, but its chronic use has many drawbacks. This review summarizes the history of ADA-SCID GT over the last 25 years, starting from first pioneering studies in the early 1990s using gamma-retroviral vectors, based on multiple infusions of genetically corrected autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. HSC represented the ideal target for gene correction to guarantee production of engineered multi-lineage progeny, but it required a decade to achieve therapeutic benefit with this approach. Introduction of low-intensity conditioning represented a crucial step in achieving stable gene-corrected HSC engraftment and therapeutic levels of ADA-expressing cells. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that gamma-retroviral GT for ADA-SCID has a favorable safety profile and is effective in restoring normal purine metabolism and immune functions in patients >13 years after treatment. No abnormal clonal proliferation or leukemia development have been observed in >40 patients treated experimentally in five different centers worldwide. In 2016, the medicinal product Strimvelis™ received marketing approval in Europe for patients affected by ADA-SCID without a suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor. Positive safety and efficacy results have been obtained in GT clinical trials using lentiviral vectors encoding ADA. The results obtained in last 25 years in ADA-SCID GT development fundamentally contributed to improve patients' prognosis, together with earlier diagnosis thanks to newborn screening. These advances open the way to further clinical development of GT as treatment for broader applications, from inherited diseases to cancer."

Briefly, B. breve transformants were obtained through electro-transformation. Bacteria-tumor-targeting ability were analyzed in vivo over different time points (1, 3 and 7 days post-bacteria injection). Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of bacteria on tumor cells in vivo were analyzed as follows: 30 Balb/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumor were randomly divided in three groups (Drug group, green fluorescent protein (GFP) group and Saline group). The therapy lasted for 2 weeks and included B. breve-IL24 administration via tail vein for Drug group, B. breve-GFP for GFP group and phosphate buffered saline for Saline group. The tumor growth was monitored using standard caliper technique, while the apoptosis induction in vivo was analyzed by Real-time Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging ([18F]-ML-10 tracer).

Prodrug 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC) used in combination with CD::UPRT suicide gene suffers from limited solubility which subsequently leads to decline in therapeutic efficacy. In order to overcome this, 5-FC encapsulated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (BSA-5-FC NPs) were prepared in this work by desolvation method. Physico-chemical characterizations studies revealed amorphous nature of BSA-5-FC NPs with uniform spherical morphology. Apart from increase in solubility, encapsulated 5-FC followed slow and sustained release profile. Suicide gene expressing stable clone of L-132 cells were adapted for investigating therapeutic potential of BSA-5-FC NPs. These nanoparticles were readily taken up by the cells in a concentration dependent manner and subsequently manifested apoptosis, which was further confirmed by morphological examination and gene expression analysis. These findings clearly illustrate that CD::UPRT suicide gene therapy can be efficiently utilized in combination with this nanosystem for improved suicide gene therapy and tumor eradication."

It is characterized by skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration and dysfunction leading to cardiac and/or respiratory failure. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a highly promising gene therapy vector. AAV gene therapy has resulted in unprecedented clinical success for treating several inherited diseases. However, AAV gene therapy for DMD remains a significant challenge. Hurdles for AAV-mediated DMD gene therapy include the difficulty to package the full-length dystrophin coding sequence in an AAV vector, the necessity for whole-body gene delivery, the immune response to dystrophin and AAV capsid, and the species-specific barriers to translate from animal models to human patients. Capsid engineering aims at improving viral vector properties by rational design and/or forced evolution. In this review, we discuss how to use the state-of-the-art AAV capsid engineering technologies to overcome hurdles in AAV-based DMD gene therapy. "

It was hypothesized that expression of the ""protective"" APOE2 variant by genetic modification of the central nervous system (CNS) of APOE4 homozygotes could reverse or prevent progressive neurologic damage. To assess the CNS distribution and safety of APOE2 gene therapy for AD in a large-animal model, intraparenchymal, intracisternal, and intraventricular routes of delivery to the CNS of nonhuman primates of AAVrh.10hAPOE2-HA, an AAVrh.10 serotype coding for an HA-tagged human APOE2 cDNA sequence, were evaluated. To evaluate the route of delivery that achieves the widest extent of APOE2 expression in the CNS, the expression of APOE2 in the CNS was evaluated 2 months following vector administration for APOE2 DNA, mRNA, and protein. Finally, using conventional toxicology assays, the safety of the best route of delivery was assessed. The data demonstrated that while all three routes are capable of mediating ApoE2 expression in AD relevant regions, intracisternal delivery of AAVrh.10hAPOE2-HA safely mediated wide distribution of ApoE2 with the least invasive surgical intervention, thus providing the optimal strategy to deliver vector-mediated human APOE2 to the CNS."

So far, there is no curative treatment against HCM, as current therapies are focused on symptoms relief by pharmacological intervention and not on the cause of HCM. In the last decade, several strategies have been developed to remove genetic defects, including genome editing, exon skipping, allele-specific silencing, spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing, and gene replacement. Most of these technologies have already been tested for efficacy and efficiency in animal- or human-induced pluripotent stem cell models of HCM with promising results. We will summarize recent technological advances and their implication as gene therapy options in HCM with a special focus on treating MYBPC3 mutations and its potential for being a successful bench to bedside example."

The main difficulties affecting bone tissue engineering are the size of the defects, the need for blood vessels and the synthesis of appropriate matrix elements in the engineered tissue. Indeed, the cartilage is an avascular tissue and consequently has limited regenerative abilities. Thanks to their self-renewal, plasticity and immunomodulatory properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) became a central player in tissue engineering, and have already been shown to be able to differentiate towards chondrogenic or osteogenic phenotypes. Whether synthetic (e.g. tricalcium phosphate) or from natural sources (e.g. hyaluronic acid), biomaterials can be shaped to fit into bone and cartilage defects to ensure mechanical resistance and may also be designed to control cell spatial distribution or differentiation. Soluble factors are classically used to promote cell differentiation and to stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis to achieve the desired tissue production. But as they have a limited lifetime, transfection using plasmid DNA or transduction via a viral vector of therapeutic genes to induce the cell secretion of these factors allows to have more lasting effects. Also, the chondrocyte phenotype may be difficult to control over time, with for example the production of hypertrophic or osteogenic markers that is undesirable in hyaline cartilage. Thus, tissue regeneration strategies became more elaborate, with an attempt at associating the benefits of MSCs, biomaterials, and gene therapy to achieve a proper tissue repair. This minireview focuses on in vitro and in vivo studies combining biomaterials and gene therapy associated with MSCs for bone and cartilage engineering."

Reports by World Health Organization indicate that 31% of all death occurrences are due to heart attacks and strokes. Today, the most common medicines for treating atherosclerosis are statins which are HMG-coA reductase inhibitors. Beside their benefits in treating atherosclerosis, some side effects have been reported as well. Thus, therapeutic methods based on statins should be evaluated to result in more beneficial effects. Since atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, an anti-inflammatory component can decrease the impact of this disease. Interleukin-38, a newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine, which acts as an Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist can block Nuclear Factor KB and Activator protein-1 signaling pathways, and block atherogenic core formation accordingly. This novel proposed immune gene therapy can be applied to atherosclerosis treatment in a trial study. In this hypothesis, Interleukin-38 gene is transferred into bone marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells of atherosclerotic mouse model Apo E-/- via an adenoviral vector. It is expected that Interleukin-38 gene expression by Mesenchymal Stem Cells can efficiently remedy atherosclerosis without the side effects of statins."

Recent epidemiological studies have reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of ASD with as many as 1 in every 59 children being diagnosed with ASD. The fact that ASD appears to be principally genetically driven, and may be reversible postnatally, has raised the exciting possibility of using gene therapy as a disease-modifying treatment. Such therapies have already started to seriously impact on human disease and particularly monogenic disorders (e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, SMA type 1). In regard to ASD, technical advances in both our capacity to model the disorder in animals and also our ability to deliver genes to the central nervous system (CNS) have led to the first preclinical studies in monogenic ASD, involving both gene replacement and silencing. Furthermore, our increasing awareness and understanding of common dysregulated pathways in ASD have broadened gene therapy's potential scope to include various polygenic ASDs. As this review highlights, despite a number of outstanding challenges, gene therapy has excellent potential to address cognitive dysfunction in ASD."

It is a maternally inherited (or sporadic) mitochondrial disorder caused primarily by mutations in genes that encode components of respiratory complex (RC)1 in mitochondria. Mitochondrial deficiency of RC1 compromises ATP production and oxidative stress management in RGCs. The most common LHON-causing mutations are 11778G>A, 3460G>A, and 14484T>C point mutations in MT-ND4, MT-ND1, and MT-ND6. The unusually high mitochondrial load of RGCs makes them particularly sensitive to these mutations. Patients with LHON may be prescribed ubiquinone (a component of RC3) or idebenone, a ubiquinone analogue with enhanced bioavailability to act downstream of RC1. The challenge of accessing the inner mitochondrial membrane with gene therapy for LHON, and other mitochondrial diseases, may be overcome by incorporation of a specific mitochondrion-targeting sequence (MTS) that enables allotropic expression of a nucleus-transcribed ND4 transgene. Because LHON penetrance is incomplete among carriers of the aforementioned mutations, identification of environmental factors, such as heavy smoking, that interact with genetics in the phenotypic expression of LHON may be helpful toward preventing or delaying disease development. LHON has become a model for mitochondrial and neurogenerative diseases owing to it having a clearly identified genetic cause and its early onset and rapid progression characteristics. Hence, LHON studies and genetic treatment advances may inform research of other diseases."

In the early age of human gene therapy, setbacks due to problematic gene delivery vehicles plagued the exciting therapeutic outcome. However, gene delivery technologies rapidly evolved ever since. With the advancement of gene delivery techniques, gene therapy clinical trials surged during the past decade. As the first gene therapy product (Glybera) has obtained regulatory approval and reached clinic, human gene therapy finally realized the promise that genes can be medicines. The diverse gene delivery techniques available today have laid the foundation for gene therapy applications in treating a wide range of human diseases. Some of the most urgent unmet medical needs, such as cancer and pandemic infectious diseases, have been tackled by gene therapy strategies with promising results. Furthermore, combining gene transfer with other breakthroughs in biomedical research and novel biotechnologies opened new avenues for gene therapy. Such innovative therapeutic strategies are unthinkable until now, and are expected to be revolutionary. In part I of this review, we introduced recent development of non-viral and viral gene delivery technology platforms. As cell-based gene therapy blossomed, we also summarized the diverse types of cells and vectors employed in ex vivo gene transfer. Finally, challenges in current gene delivery technologies for human use were discussed. "

Even though revascularization strategies such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention and enhanced drug therapy significantly improved the outcome, about 30 % of patients develop chronic heart failure. Ischemic heart disease and heart failure are characterized by an adverse remodeling of the heart, featuring cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased fibrosis and capillary rarefaction. Therefore, gene therapeutic approaches for the treatment of heart failure, such as the modulating contractile function or therapeutic neovascularization, seem to be promising. To achieve an efficient transduction of the gene therapeutic agent, the time point and the application route seem to be important for the therapeutic success. In contrast to the classical systemic application regional intra-coronary application offers the possibility of higher transduction efficacy in the target area accompanied by a reduced off-target contamination. Antegrade delivery however, may be impaired by coronary heart disease, such as stenosis or occlusion of a coronary artery. Coronary veins appear not to be affected and might therefore be the preferable application route for gene therapy. For an effective and safe retrograde application in gene therapy, selective catheterization of the coronary vein draining the target area is necessary. In addition, to avoid coronary vein injury, a pressure regulated infusion enhances safety. Therefore, a selective pressure regulation of retroinfusion (SSR) seems to be a favorable approach for gene therapy transduction in combination with reduced systemic contamination."
