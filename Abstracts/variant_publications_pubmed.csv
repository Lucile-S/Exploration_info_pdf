This includes the strong evidence codes PS3 and BS3 for ""well-established"" functional assays demonstrating a variant has abnormal or normal gene/protein function, respectively. However, they did not provide detailed guidance on how functional evidence should be evaluated, and differences in the application of the PS3/BS3 codes are a contributor to variant interpretation discordance between laboratories. This recommendation seeks to provide a more structured approach to the assessment of functional assays for variant interpretation and guidance on the use of various levels of strength based on assay validation."

Studies on the pathogenicity of the germline splicing ATM variant c.1066-6T>G have provided conflicting results. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified two splice site ATM variants, c.1066-6T>G; [p.?], and c.2250G>A, [p.Ile709_Lys750del], in a compound heterozygous state in a 27-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as having congenital ocular motor apraxia type Cogan in her childhood. Reappraisal of her clinical phenotype revealed consistency with variant A-T. Functional analyses showed reduced expression of ATM protein and residual activity of the ATM kinase at a level consistent with variant A-T. Our results provide evidence for pathogenicity of the leaky ATM splice site variant c.1066-6T>G."

Fabry disease phenotypes are known to consist of a classic variant and a late-onset variant. In patients with Fabry disease, the phenotype is generally considered to be defined (at least partially) by the genotype. However, patients with the classic variant have been encountered in families with mutations that are expected to produce the late-onset variant. Here, we describe a 4-year-old boy with a classic variant of Fabry disease in a family with the M296I late-onset variant. The patient's grandfather, mother, and aunt experienced late-onset disease, characteristic of the M296I variant. Conversely, the patient experienced typical disease symptoms in childhood. He had symptoms of hypohidrosis and associated heat accumulation. He cried at night due to the occurrence of severe acroparaesthesia. This symptom became more pronounced in warmer climates. Although the patient's family had a late-onset variant mutation of Fabry disease, we determined that the patient's symptoms were similar to those of classic Fabry disease. Therefore, the patient began enzyme replacement therapy, which alleviated his symptoms. Notably, enzyme replacement therapy led to rapid improvement of the patient's subjective symptoms. Thus, we presumed that the patient's symptoms supported a diagnosis of classic Fabry disease. These findings suggest that childhood symptoms may occur in patients with Fabry disease, even in families with late-onset variant mutations. The genotype-phenotype correlation in Fabry disease remains controversial."

A few variant calling methods have been previously developed but they show a low concordance between their variant calls. A gold standard of variant sets generated from one human individual sample was established for variant calling tool evaluations, however hitherto no gold standard of crop variant set is available for wheat use.

Next- generation sequencing (NGS) is the most popular technology for genome-wide variant calling. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) has also recently been used in genetic studies. Although many variant callers are available, no single caller can call both types of variants on NGS or TGS data with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we systematically evaluated 11 variant callers on 12 NGS and TGS datasets. For germline variant calling, we tested DNAseq and DNAscope modes from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and WGS mode from DeepVariant. All the four callers had comparable performance on NGS data and 30× coverage of WGS data was recommended. For germline variant calling on TGS data, we tested DNAseq mode from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and PACBIO mode from DeepVariant. All the three callers had similar performance in SNP calling, while DeepVariant outperformed the others in InDel calling. TGS detected more variants than NGS, particularly in complex and repetitive regions. For somatic variant calling on NGS, we tested TNscope and TNseq modes from Sentieon, MuTect2 mode from GATK, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, and Strelka2. TNscope and Mutect2 outperformed the other callers. A higher proportion of tumor sample purity (from 10 to 20%) significantly increased the recall value of calling. Finally, computational costs of the callers were compared and Sentieon required the least computational cost. These results suggest that careful selection of a tool and parameters is needed for accurate SNP or InDel calling under different scenarios."

The causal variant was previously reported as a 11.7 kb deletion at approximately 129 Mb on chromosome 1 that affects the transcription of both FOXL2 and several long non-coding RNAs. In the meantime the presence of different versions of the PIS deletion was postulated and trials to establish genetic testing with the existing molecular genetic information failed. Therefore, we revisited this variant by long-read whole-genome sequencing of two genetically female (XX) goats, a PIS-affected and a horned control. This revealed the presence of a more complex structural variant consisting of a deletion with a total length of 10 159 bp and an inversely inserted approximately 480 kb-sized duplicated segment of a region located approximately 21 Mb further downstream on chromosome 1 containing two genes, KCNJ15 and ERG. Publicly available short-read whole-genome sequencing data, Sanger sequencing of the breakpoints and FISH using BAC clones corresponding to both involved genome regions confirmed this structural variant. A diagnostic PCR was developed for simultaneous genotyping of carriers for this variant and determination of their genetic sex. We showed that the variant allele was present in all 334 genotyped polled goats of diverse breeds and that all analyzed 15 PIS-affected XX goats were homozygous. Our findings enable for the first time a precise genetic diagnosis for polledness and PIS in goats and add a further genomic feature to the complexity of the PIS phenomenon."

In the initial surgery, one patient had a 36-mm lymph node metastasis in the lateral compartment, which was diagnosed as hobnail variant on pathology; 9 months post-surgery, metastases to the ipsilateral lateral lymph node, lung, and bone were newly detected. Her lung metastasis grew rapidly; its tumor volume-doubling time was 0.15 years and its tumor-doubling rate was 6.67/year. One patient underwent annual ultrasound examinations as postoperative follow-up after hemithyroidectomy for a benign nodule, but a 35-mm nodule diagnosed as PTC on cytology and lateral node metastases appeared within a short period, and she underwent a second surgery.

Herein, we subjected four patients with initial diagnostics of NS-ID in a consanguineous Iranian family. To find the possible genetic cause(s), Trio-WES was performed on the proband and his both healthy parents. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the identified variant by WES and also investigate whether it co-segregates with the patients' phenotype in the family. Using several online in-silico predictors, the probable impacts of the variant on structure and function of GPT2 protein were predicted. A novel variant, c.266A>G; p.(Glu89Gly), in exon 3 of GPT2 (NM_133443.3) was identified using Trio-WES. The candidate variant was also verified by Sanger sequencing. All affected members showed the common clinical features suffering from a non-progressive mild-to-severe ID. Also, different clinical observations compared to previously reported cases such as no facial features, no obvious structural malformations, ability to speak but with difficulty, and lack of any morphological defects were noted for the first time in this family. The c.266A>G; p.(Glu89Gly) variant reported here is the sixth variant identified up to now in the GPT2 gene, to be associated with NS-ID.

Because the #C levels are affected by plasma glucose levels, we investigated the usefulness of plasma glucose adjusted #C (PGa#C) for the screening of variant Hb complicated with diabetes mellitus. In this study, nine types of variant Hb in nine diabetic patients were included. HbA1c and the #C fraction were measured by Arkray's HPLC. Furthermore, we established a calculation formula for PGa#C by using the regression equation of #C and plasma glucose of 2,299 diabetic patients without variant Hb. If the cutoff value of PGa#C for the screening of variant Hb with diabetes mellitus was set at 1.3% or lower and 2.3% or higher, sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 99.8%, respectively. The PGa#C levels in all four slow moving variant Hb with diabetes were less than 1.3%, while the PGa#C levels of fast moving variant Hb with diabetes were abnormal values in four out of five patients [high #C level in one and low #C levels in three patients]. The screening of variant Hb with diabetes with high sensitivity and high specificity was possible by using the same cutoff values for the reference range of PGa#C as the #C values reported in non-diabetic subjects."

It is widely recognized that nested variant of urothelial carcinoma can closely mimic von Brunn nests. However, nested variant of urothelial carcinoma with tubule formation can also resemble nephrogenic adenoma, where immunohistochemical positivity for PAX8 has been used to establish the diagnosis of nephrogenic adenoma. Following anecdotal examples of PAX8 positive nested variant of urothelial carcinoma, we formally evaluated 23 cases of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma from 2011 to 2018. Cases were collected from our institution and evaluated for their architectural pattern and PAX8 expression. Except for 1 case from the renal pelvis, cases were located in the bladder. The majority (14/23 [61%]) showed solid nests with at least focal tubular differentiation. PAX8 immunoreactivity was strong (3+) in 7 (30%), moderate (2+) in 6 (26%), and negative in 10 (44%) cases. Four (57%) of the cases with strong expression and 3 (50%) of those with moderate staining showed diffuse immunoreactivity. Moderate-strong immunoreactivity was seen in 4/6 (66.7%) cases with solid nests, 8/14 (57.1%) with solid nests and tubules, and 1/3 (33.3%) with large nests. In conclusion, PAX8 can be positive in a significant proportion of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma cases, and recognition of this finding is important to avoid misdiagnosis of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma as nephrogenic adenoma based on PAX8 expression, particularly in cases with tubular differentiation and limited sampling."

Spelling impairments appear early in the development of the disorder, and the three PPA variants (non-fluent - nfvPPA; semantic - svPPA; logopenic - lvPPA) reportedly show fairly distinct spelling profiles. Given the theoretical and empirical evidence indicating that spelling may serve as a proxy for spoken language, the current study aimed to determine whether spelling performance alone, when evaluated with advanced statistical analyses, allows for accurate PPA variant classification. A spelling to dictation task (with real words and pseudowords) was administered to 33 PPA individuals: 17 lvPPA, 10 nfvPPA, 6 svPPA. Using machine learning classification algorithms, we obtained pairwise variant classification accuracies that ranged between 67 and 100%. In additional analyses that assumed no prior knowledge of each case's variant, classification accuracies ranged between 59 and 70%. To our knowledge, this is the first time that all the PPA variants, including the most challenging logopenic variant, have been classified with such high accuracy when using information from a single language task. These results underscore the rich structure of the spelling process and support the use of a spelling task in PPA variant classification."

Genomic DNA was amplified for ascertaining of UCP2 (G-866A; rs659366) variant exploiting the PCR-RFLP technique. A literature search was completed to investigate the involvement of this variant with obesity from various genetic databases. In this case-control study, the distribution of UCP2 (rs659366) variant showed a significant association with obesity among Egyptian subjects under allelic and dominant models (P value = 0.0006 and < 0.001, respectively). Overall, twenty-five comparisons for this variant (8652 obese patients and 10,075 non-obese controls) were recruited in this meta-analysis survey. A noteworthy association of UCP2 (rs659366) variant with obesity was identified among Asians and Africans but not Caucasians under allelic, dominant as well as heterozygote models. Nevertheless, this meta-analysis could not accomplish a noticeable association with overall subjects under different genetic models. This case-controlled study revealed a robust association for UCP2 (rs659366) variant with obesity susceptibility in Egyptian subjects; however, this meta-analysis survey failed to achieve an association for this variant with obesity in overall subjects except among Asians and Africans."

Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants.

Methods and Results We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with primary DCM who presented to our institution between 2008 and 2018. Variants identified by genetic testing were reevaluated for pathogenicity on the basis of current guidelines for variant classification. A total of 73 patients with primary DCM presented to our institution and 63 (86%) were probands that underwent cardiomyopathy-specific gene testing. A disease-causing variant was identified in 19 of 63 (30%) of cases, with at least 9/19 (47%) variants occurring de novo. Positive family history was not associated with identification of a causal variant. Reclassification of variants resulted in the downgrading of a large proportion of variants of uncertain significance and did not identify any new disease-causing variants. Conclusions Clinical genetic testing identifies a causal variant in one third of pediatric patients with primary DCM. Variant reevaluation significantly decreased the number of variants of uncertain significance, but a large burden of variants of uncertain significance remain. These results highlight the need for periodic reanalysis of genetic testing results, additional investigation of genotype-phenotype correlations in DCM through large, multicenter genetic studies, and development of improved tools for functional characterization of variants of uncertain significance."

Since host genetics is an important factor in strain modification, the identification of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infection in a PRNP 129 methionine/valine heterozygous individual has raised the possibility that the properties of the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent could change after transmission to this different genetic background and concerns that this could lead to a more virulent strain of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strain has to date been characterized only in methionine homozygous individuals, therefore to establish whether the strain characteristics of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had been modified by the host genotype, spleen material with prion protein deposition from a PRNP 129 methionine/valine individual was inoculated into a panel of wild-type mice. Three passages in mice were undertaken to allow stabilization of the strain characteristics following its passage into mice. In each passage, a combination of clinical signs, neuropathology (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy vacuolation and prion protein deposition) were analysed and biochemical analysis carried out. While some differences were observed at primary and first subpassage, following the second subpassage, strain characteristics in the methionine/valine individual were totally consistent with those of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmitted to 129 methionine/methionine individuals thus demonstrated no alteration in strain properties were imposed by passage through the different host genotype. Thus we have demonstrated variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strain properties are not affected by transmission through an individual with the PRNP methionine/valine codon 129 genotype and thus no alteration in virulence should be associated with the different host genotype."

Here, we report a family with two infants diagnosed with infantile-onset HCM and mitral valve dysplasia that led to death before one year of age. Using exome sequencing, we discovered that one of the affected children had a homozygous frameshift variant in Myosin light chain 2 (MYL2:NM_000432.3:c.431_432delCT: p.Pro144Argfs*57;MYL2-fs), which alters the last 20 amino acids of the protein and is predicted to impact the most C-terminal of the three EF-hand domains in MYL2. The parents are unaffected heterozygous carriers of the variant and the variant is absent in control cohorts from gnomAD. The absence of the phenotype in carriers and the infantile presentation of severe HCM is in contrast to HCM associated with dominant MYL2 variants. Immunohistochemical analysis of the ventricular muscle of the deceased patient with the MYL2-fs variant showed a marked reduction of MYL2 expression compared to an unaffected control. In vitro overexpression studies further indicate that the MYL2-fs variant is actively degraded. In contrast, an HCM-associated missense variant (MYL2:p.Gly162Arg) and three other MYL2 stop-gain variants (p.E22*, p.K62*, p.E97*) that result in loss of the EF domains are stably expressed but show impaired localization. The degradation of the MYL2-fs can be rescued by inhibiting the cell's proteasome function supporting a post-translational effect of the variant. In vivo rescue experiments with a Drosophila MYL2-homolog (Mlc2) knockdown model indicate that neither the MYL2-fs nor the MYL2:p.Gly162Arg variant supports normal cardiac function. The tools that we have generated provide a rapid screening platform for functional assessment of variants of unknown significance in MYL2. Our study supports an autosomal recessive model of inheritance for MYL2 loss-of-function variants in infantile HCM and highlights the variant-specific molecular differences found in MYL2-associated cardiomyopathy."

The pathogenesis of this novel complex I (CI) variant was verified by determining the mitochondrial respiration, assembly of CI, ATP, MMP and lactate production, and cell growth rate in cybrids with and without this variant. Results A novel m.14430A > G (p.W82R) variant in the NADH dehydrogenase 6 (ND6) gene was identified in the patient; the mutant loads of m.14430A > G (p.W82R) in the patient were much higher than those in his mother. Although the transmitochondrial cybrid-based study showed that mitochondrial CI assembly remains unaffected in cells with the m.14430G variant, control cells had significantly higher endogenous and CI-dependent mitochondrial respiration than mutant cells.

Despite the importance of glutamine in mitochondrial metabolism, the mitochondrial glutamine transporter has long been unknown. Here, we show that the SLC1A5 variant plays a critical role in cancer metabolic reprogramming by transporting glutamine into mitochondria. The SLC1A5 variant has an N-terminal targeting signal for mitochondrial localization. Hypoxia-induced gene expression of the SLC1A5 variant is mediated by HIF-2α. Overexpression of the SLC1A5 variant mediates glutamine-induced ATP production and glutathione synthesis and confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells. SLC1A5 variant knockdown and overexpression alter cancer cell and tumor growth, supporting an oncogenic role. This work demonstrates that the SLC1A5 variant is a mitochondrial glutamine transporter for cancer metabolic reprogramming."

The first mutation discovered in this class is the KRAS-variant, a let-7-binding site mutation in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene. The KRAS-variant predicts increased cancer risk for certain populations, is a predictive biomarker of cancer treatment response across cancer types, leads to conserved tumor biology and elevated AKT signaling in KRAS-variant patient tumors, and was recently found to predict elevated TGF-β and immunosuppression in cancer patients. Based on the functional biology of the KRAS-variant in cancer patients, here we chose to investigate altered normal cellular biology in the presence of the KRAS-variant, through interrogation of an isogenic normal breast epithelial cell line model with and without the KRAS-variant. We find that KRAS-variant normal breast epithelial cells exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype, which appears to be due to numerous molecular changes, including miRNA dysregulation and autocrine pathway alterations, including elevated TGF-β, resulting in ZEB and SNAIL upregulation.

Expandable primary human (upcyte®) hepatocytes and human PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells were lentivirally transduced with both PNPLA3 I148M variants and stimulated with lipids. Cytokine levels in culture supernatant and patient sera (n = 80) were analyzed by ELISA. Supernatants were assessed in transmigration experiments, tube formation, and proliferation assays. In vitro, lipid stimulation of transduced hepatocytes dose-dependently induced the production of interleukin-8 and CXCL1 in hepatocytes carrying the PNPLA3 148M variant. In line, sera from PNPLA3 148M-positive patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis contained higher levels of interleukin-8 and CXCL1 than patients with wild-type PNPLA3.

Such assessments should be performed in a consistent, transparent and reproducible fashion, using independently, orthogonally generated data.

ICR142 Benchmarker also automatically generates a single page report highlighting key performance metrics and how performance compares to widely-used open-source tools. We used ICR142 Benchmarker with VCF files outputted by GATK, OpEx and DeepVariant to create a benchmark for variant calling performance. This evaluation revealed pipeline-specific differences and shared challenges in variant calling, for example in detecting indels in short repeating sequence motifs. We next used ICR142 Benchmarker to perform regression testing with DeepVariant versions 0.5.2 and 0.6.1. This showed that v0.6.1 improves variant calling performance, but there was evidence of minor changes in indel calling behaviour that may benefit from attention. The data also allowed us to evaluate filters to optimise DeepVariant calling, and we recommend using 30 as the QUAL threshold for base substitution calls when using DeepVariant v0.6.1. Finally, we used ICR142 Benchmarker with VCF files from two commercial variant calling providers to facilitate optimisation of their in-house pipelines and to provide transparent benchmarking of their performance. ICR142 Benchmarker consistently and transparently analyses variant calling performance based on the ICR142 NGS validation series, using the standard VCF input and outputting informative metrics to enable user understanding of pipeline performance.

When asked how they approached counseling sessions involving variant interpretation discrepancies, the free responses emphasized that counselors considered family history, clinical information, and psychosocial concerns, showing that genetic counselors tailored the session to each individual. Discrepancies in variant interpretation are an ongoing concern for clinical cancer genetic counselors, as demonstrated by the fact that counselors desired further resources to aid in addressing these discrepancies, including a centralized database (89%), guidelines from a major organization (88%), continuing education about the issue (74%), and functional studies (58%). Additionally, most respondents reported that the ideal database would be owned by a non-profit organization (59%) and obtain information directly from laboratories (91%). This investigation was the first to address these discrepancies from a clinical point of view. The study demonstrates that discrepancies in variant interpretation are a concern for clinical cancer genetic counselors and outlines the need for additional support."

Accurate detection of these complex variants from whole genome sequencing data is influenced by a multitude of parameters. However, there are currently no tools for guiding study design nor are there applications that could predict the performance of somatic structural variant detection. To address this gap, we developed Shiny-SoSV, a user-friendly web-based calculator for determining the impact of common variables on the sensitivity, precision and F1 score of somatic structural variant detection, including choice of variant detection tool, sequencing depth of coverage, variant allele fraction, and variant breakpoint resolution. Using simulation studies, we determined singular and combinatoric effects of these variables, modelled the results using a generalised additive model, allowing structural variant detection performance to be predicted for any combination of predictors. Shiny-SoSV provides an interactive and visual platform for users to easily compare individual and combined impact of different parameters. It predicts the performance of a proposed study design, on somatic structural variant detection, prior to the commencement of benchwork. Shiny-SoSV is freely available at https://hcpcg.shinyapps.io/Shiny-SoSV with accompanying user's guide and example use-cases."

In about 2% hemophilia A patients, no exonic mutation of F8 gene was found. We aimed to identify deep intronic mutations of F8 gene. We reanalyzed the next-generation sequencing data of six hemophilia A patients with negative F8 variant in either coding region or splice site. Deep intronic F8 c.5999-27A>G variant (NM_000132.3) was found in two unrelated moderate hemophilia A patients from different region, and one patient's mother was mild hemophilia A patient. Splice site prediction algorithms showed no impact of this variant on F8 mRNA splicing of exon 19, including Human Splicing Finder 3.1, NNSPLICE 0.9, NetGene2, and Transcript-inferred Pathogenicity score. Exonic splicing enhancer was predicted by ESEfinder, and no difference was found between the wild type and mutant sequence. The branch point predicted by SVM-BPfinder suggested that F8 c.5999-27A>G variant may disrupt the branch point in intron 18 and affect the acceptor site splicing of F8 exon 19. Sanger sequencing of F8 cDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that F8 c.5999-27A>G variant caused F8 exon 19 skipping in proband and his mother. Skewed X chromosome inactivation was found in another X chromosome of this mother, combined with F8 c.5999-27A>G variant in trans. In conclusion, our study suggests that deep intronic F8 c.5999-27A>G variant may be responsible for F8 exon 19 skipping and lead to moderate hemophilia A. Systematic reanalysis of next-generation sequencing data could promote the diagnostic yields."

Hispanic patients with CF are known to have increased morbidity and mortality compared to non-Hispanic white patients with CF, and ongoing investigations are underway to identify contributing factors amenable to intervention in order to address the disparate health outcomes. One contributing factor is the different CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variant profile observed in Hispanic patients with CF. The most common CFTR variant, p.Phe508del (legacy name F508del), is proportionally underrepresented in Hispanic patients with CF. This difference has implications for prenatal screening, newborn screening (NBS), and CFTR variant-specific therapeutic options. In particular, the recent approval of a highly effective CFTR modulator for patients carrying at least one copy of F508del, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor triple combination therapy, underscores the potential for unequal access to personalized treatment for Hispanic patients with CF. We report the CFTR variant profiles of Hispanic patients with CF and non-CF Hispanic infants with a false-positive New York State CF NBS at a single center in New York City over a 5-year study period, as an opportunity to address the racial and ethnic disparities that currently exist in CF screening, diagnosis, and treatment. In addition to the previously documented disparate prevalence of the CFTR variant F508del in Hispanic patients, we observed two CFTR variants, p.His609Arg (legacy name H609R) and p.Thr1036Asn (legacy name T1036N), frequently identified in our Hispanic patients of Ecuadorian and Mexican ancestry, respectively, that are not well-described in the US population. The presence of population-specific and individually rare CFTR variants in Hispanic patients with CF further accentuates the disparity in health outcomes, as these CFTR variants are often absent from prenatal and NBS CFTR variant panels, potentially delaying diagnosis, and without an approved CFTR variant-specific therapy."

Given the paucity of evidence to accurately classify each variant and the difficulty of experimentally evaluating its clinical significance, a large number of variants generated by clinical tests are reported as variants of unknown clinical significance. Population-scale variant databases can improve clinical interpretation. Specifically, pathogenicity prediction for novel missense variants can use features describing regional variant constraint. Constrained genomic regions are those that have an unusually low variant count in the general population. Computational methods have been introduced to capture these regions and incorporate them into pathogenicity classifiers, but these methods have yet to be compared on an independent clinical variant data set. Here, we introduce one variant data set derived from clinical sequencing panels and use it to compare the ability of different genomic constraint metrics to determine missense variant pathogenicity. This data set is compiled from 17,071 patients surveyed with clinical genomic sequencing for cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, or RASopathies. We further use this data set to demonstrate the necessity of disease-specific classifiers and to train PathoPredictor, a disease-specific ensemble classifier of pathogenicity based on regional constraint and variant-level features. PathoPredictor achieves an average precision >90% for variants from all 99 tested disease genes while approaching 100% accuracy for some genes. The accumulation of larger clinical variant training data sets can significantly enhance their performance in a disease- and gene-specific manner."

Based on the premise that severe, early-onset disorders often result in a reduction of evolutionary fitness, several statistical methods have been developed to predict pathogenic variants or constrained genes based on the signatures of negative selection in human populations. However, we currently lack a statistical framework to jointly predict deleterious variants and constrained genes from both variant-level features and gene-level selective constraints. Here we present such a unified approach, UNEECON, based on deep learning and population genetics. UNEECON treats the contributions of variant-level features and gene-level constraints as a variant-level fixed effect and a gene-level random effect, respectively. The sum of the fixed and random effects is then combined with an evolutionary model to infer the strength of negative selection at both variant and gene levels. Compared with previously published methods, UNEECON shows improved performance in predicting missense variants and protein-coding genes associated with autosomal dominant disorders, and feature importance analysis suggests that both gene-level selective constraints and variant-level predictors are important for accurate variant prioritization. Furthermore, based on UNEECON, we observe a low correlation between gene-level intolerance to missense mutations and that to loss-of-function mutations, which can be partially explained by the prevalence of disordered protein regions that are highly tolerant to missense mutations. Finally, we show that genes intolerant to both missense and loss-of-function mutations play key roles in the central nervous system and the autism spectrum disorders. Overall, UNEECON is a promising framework for both variant and gene prioritization."

The TSHβ splice variant and native TSHβ exhibit different expression profiles, and research has been conducted to elucidate the role of the TSHβ splice variant in different diseases. However, understanding of the fundamental physiological characteristics of the TSHβ splice variant is currently limited. To verify whether the TSHβ splice variant has the potential to induce thyroid follicular cells to synthesize thyroid hormone, in vivo and in vitro stimulation experiments were conducted in the present study. A total of 60 C57BL/6 mice were divided into control‑, 5 and 10 µg TSHβ splice variant‑treated groups at random. Mice were sacrificed at 0.5, 1 and 4 h after intraperitoneal injection, and serum levels of tri‑iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were determined using a radioimmunoassay. Thyroid follicular cells were isolated from the thyroids of mice, and stimulated with 2 µg/ml TSHβ splice variant. Supernatants were collected, and the levels of T3 and T4 were detected. The protein expression levels of the sodium‑iodide symporter, thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin in thyroid follicular cells were quantified using western blot analysis. To verify whether the TSHβ splice variant expression was regulated by the hypothalamus‑pituitary‑thyroid (HPT) axis, similar to native TSHβ, a total of 60 C57BL/6 mice were equally divided into control, 2 mg/kg T3 intraperitoneal injection and 0.05 mg/kg thyroid‑releasing hormone intraperitoneal injection groups at random. Mice were sacrificed at 1 and 4 h after injection. Alterations in the expression of the TSHβ splice variant in the pituitary, thyroid, peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen tissues were detected using western blot analysis. The present study demonstrated that the TSHβ splice variant is not regulated by the HPT axis and may affect thyroid hormone synthesis.

The use of such technologies requires a PCR amplification step and a sequencing step, steps in which artifacts are introduced at very low frequencies. These artifacts are often confused with true low-frequency variants that can be found in tumor cells and cell-free DNA. The recent use of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) in targeted sequencing protocols has offered a trustworthy approach to filter out artefactual variants and accurately call low-frequency variants. However, the integration of UMI analysis in the variant calling process led to developing tools that are significantly slower and more memory consuming than raw-reads-based variant callers."

In 2018, samples from Ross 308 breeding hens aged 35 weeks were delivered for IBV diagnosis. IBV presence was detected, but all attempts to amplify the S gene fragment were negative. The field material was analysed using the Illumina MiSeq platform and a 1073-nt fragment of the S1 coding region was obtained. The gCoV/ck/Poland/516/2018 strain shared only 52.7-58.1% nucleotide identity to any known genotype of IBV and shared the highest identity of 81.4% to the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant. Based on the obtained sequence, a specific molecular test was constructed and used for screening of chicken samples from 35 field cases delivered to our laboratory between 2018 and 2019 for IBV diagnosis. Application of this test enabled detection of another three chicken flocks as positive for this new strain. All positives were identified in commercial layers with egg production problems. To date, the virus has not been detected in broiler chickens. Taking into account the proposed criteria for the definition of a new IBV genotype or lineage, it seems that the detected viruses in Poland, together with the unique North American PA/1220/98 variant, may be classified as separate lineages/genotype in the new IBV classification.

By multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, genomic sequencing, and T-A cloning on cDNA level, we identified one novel SMN1 subtle variant c.835G>C (p.Gly279Arg) in a non-homozygous patient with type 1 SMA. Full-length SMN1 (fl-SMN1) transcripts in the peripheral bloods of the patient were significantly decreased compared with those in healthy individuals and the carries (p < 0.05). And two fragments of SMN1 transcripts including fl-SMN1 and △7-SMN1 were observed by RT-PCR, which indicated Exon 7 skipping of SMN1 gene. To further evaluate its splicing effects on Exon 7, we performed ex vivo splicing analysis, which showed that the mutant mini gene with c.835G>C reduced Exon 7 inclusion to 54%. In addition, self-oligomerization between mutant SMN protein with the c.835G>C (p.Gly279Arg) and wild SMN was decreased in self-interaction assays. Our study clearly demonstrates that the c.835G>C (p.Gly279Arg) variant can lead to a decrease in fl-SMN1 transcripts by interrupting correct splicing of SMN1. What is more, the variant also affects SMN self-oligomerization via amino acid substitution from Gly to Arg at amino acid position of 279. This work presents the first evidence that it does exit double-hit events for the novel variant, which is crucial to understanding a severe SMA phenotype (type 1)."

However, recent studies have disputed that with the report of patients presenting with marked episodic memory impairment. Besides that, structural and functional changes in temporal lobe regions responsible for episodic memory processing are often detected in neuroimaging studies of both conditions. In this study, we investigated the gray matter features associated with the Papez circuit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and healthy controls to further explore similarities and differences between the two conditions. Our non-demented amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients showed no episodic memory deficits measured by a short-term delayed recall test while no changes in gray matter of the Papez circuit were found. Compared with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis group, the behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia group had lower performance on the short-term delayed recall test and marked atrophy in gray matter of the Papez circuit. Bilateral atrophy of entorhinal cortex and mammillary bodies distinguished behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients as well as atrophy in left cingulate, left hippocampus and right parahippocampal gyrus.

Currently, two approaches are usually applied to convert SNV annotations into SAV-harboring protein sequences. One approach generates one sequence containing exactly one SAV, and the other all SAVs. However, they may neglect the possibility of SAV combinations, e.g., haplotypes, existing in bio-samples. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all SAV combinations of a protein when generating SAV-harboring protein sequences. In this paper, we propose MinProtMaxVP, a novel approach which selects a minimized number of SAV-harboring protein sequences generated from the exhaustive approach, while still accommodating all possible variant peptides, by solving a classic set covering problem. Our study on known haplotype variations of TAS2R38 justifies the necessity for MinProtMaxVP to consider all combinations of SAVs. The performance of MinProtMaxVP is demonstrated by an in silico study on OR2T27 with five SAVs and real experimental data of the HEK293 cell line. Furthermore, assuming simulated somatic and germline variants of OR2T27 in tumor and normal tissues demonstrates that when adopting the appropriate somatic and germline SAV integration strategy, MinProtMaxVP is adaptable to labeling and label-free mass spectrometry-based experiments. SIGNIFICANCE: We present MinProtMaxVP, a novel approach to generate SAV-harboring protein sequences for constructing a customized protein sequence database, which is used in database searching for variant peptide identification. This approach outperforms the existing approaches in generating all possible variant peptides to be included in protein sequences and possibly leading to identification of more variant peptides in proteogenomic analysis."

Here, we show that the T300A variant confers protection against urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common infectious disease in women. Using knockin mice carrying the human T300A variant, we show that the variant limits the UTI-causing bacteria, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), from establishing persistent intracellular reservoirs, which can seed UTI recurrence. This phenotype is recapitulated in mice lacking Atg16l1 or Atg7 exclusively in the urothelium. We further show that mice with the T300A variant exhibit urothelial cellular abnormalities, including vesicular congestion and aberrant accumulation of UPK (uroplakin) proteins. Importantly, presence of the T300A variant in humans is associated with similar urothelial architectural abnormalities, indicating an evolutionarily conserved impact. Mechanistically, we show that the reduced bacterial persistence is independent of basal autophagic flux or proinflammatory cytokine responses and does not involve Atg14 or Epg5. However, the T300A variant is associated with increased expression of the small GTPase Rab33b; RAB33B interacts with ATG16L1, as well as other secretory RABs, RAB27B and RAB11A, important for UPEC exocytosis from the urothelium. Finally, inhibition of secretory RABs in bladder epithelial cells increases intracellular UPEC load. Together, our results reveal that UPEC selectively utilize genes important for autophagosome formation to persist in the urothelium, and that the presence of the T300A variant in ATG16L1 is associated with changes in urothelial vesicle trafficking, which disrupts the ability of UPEC to persist, thereby limiting the risk of recurrent UTIs.

As the number of states testing for Fabry disease on their newborn screening panel has increased, more people with this variant are being identified. The goal of this project was to learn how the uncertainty surrounding the clinical significance of the p.A143T variant affects those with this change. A self-response questionnaire was developed to explore this topic. In addition to evaluating participant feelings, the questionnaire explored individuals' beliefs regarding the pathogenicity of the variant. Results suggest that people have diverse feelings regarding reclassification of the p.A143T variant. Around half of those surveyed reported feeling frustrated by the lack of clear information. Despite the ambiguity regarding the health consequences of this variant, many participants felt that knowing this result helps guide medical management."

Decision support systems able to automate variant interpretation in the light of specific disease domains are demanded. We implemented CardioVAI (Cardio Variant Interpreter), an automated system for guidelines based variant classification in cardiovascular-related genes. Different omics-resources were integrated to assess pathogenicity of every genomic variant in 72 cardiovascular diseases related genes. We validated our method on benchmark datasets of high-confident assessed variants, reaching pathogenicity and benignity concordance up to 83 and 97.08%, respectively.

We investigate the validity of these two approaches in terms of false negatives (the true disease-causing variant does not pass all filters) and false positives (a harmless mutation passes all filters and is erroneously retained in the list of putative disease-causing variants) and compare it with an novel approach which we named the quantile-based approach.

To validate the pathogenicity of this variant and confirm its association with ACM, we established a knockin mouse model carrying the orthologous human homozygous PNPLA2 variant. Interestingly, mice with the homozygous variant presented with arrhythmias and significant cardiac dysfunction at 12 weeks, whereas heterozygous mice were not affected. Moreover, those homozygous mice suffered sudden death and/or heart failure by the age of 14 weeks.

The recombinant multi-variant epitope gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The expressed protein of the variant multi-variant epitope gene can react with positive sera and monoclonal antibodies of ALV-J, while cannot react with ALV-J negative sera. The multi-variant epitope vaccine that conjugated Freund's adjuvant complete/incomplete showed high immunogenicity that reached the titer of 1:64,000 at 42 days post immunization and maintained the immune period for at least 126 days in SPF chickens. Further, we demonstrated that the antibody induced by the variant multi-variant ensemble epitope vaccine recognized and neutralized different ALV-J strains (NX0101, TA1, WS1, BZ1224 and BZ4). Protection experiment that was evaluated by clinical symptom, viral shedding, weight gain, gross and histopathology showed 100% chickens that inoculated the multi-epitope vaccine were well protected against ALV-J challenge.

Its huge phenotypic variability cannot be explained solely by the repeat number. Recently, variant repeats within the DMPK expansions have emerged as potential disease modifiers. The frequency of variant expanded alleles was estimated in 242 DM1 patients from 174 Serbian families using repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). The patterns of variant repeats were determined by direct sequencing of RP-PCR or PCR products. PCR-based southern blot was performed to get insight into the intergenerational mutational dynamics of variant expanded alleles. All patients carrying variant repeats were clinically re-examined. Variant repeats were observed in eight patients from five families (2.9%). They were detected only at the 3' end of DMPK expansions. CCG variant repeats were present in seven patients, either as a part of regular runs of CCGCTG hexamer, individual repeats, or CCG blocks. Analyses of three intergenerational transmissions revealed a considerable stability or likely a contraction of variant expanded alleles. Intriguingly, a decrease in age at onset accompanied these transmissions. Overall, patients were characterized by a milder phenotype and/or some atypical symptoms that could be rather clinically suggestive of myotonic dystrophy type 2. In addition, the first case of de novo CTC variant repeat was observed. Variant repeats might explain a part of the phenotypic variability in a small percent of DM1 patients and likely display a stabilizing effect on the meiotic instability of DMPK expanded alleles."

Prediction accuracies for five traits increased in the MB analysis. Fitting MSTN-F94L as a fixed effect in PL, AL and MB analyses resulted in increased prediction accuracy in PL for eight traits. Prediction accuracies can be improved by including a causal variant in genomic evaluation compared with simply using whole-genome SNP markers. Fitting the causal variant as a fixed effect along with markers fitted as random effects resulted in greater prediction accuracies for most traits.

Likelihood ratios in favor of variant pathogenicity were determined for a report of the personal history of several TP53-related cancers, using data from 2,656 probands undergoing single-gene testing (SGT) and 15,483 undergoing multi-gene panel testing (MGPT). Overall, TP53-associated cancers were more predictive of pathogenicity, and demonstrated greater evidence weight, in the MGPT versus SGT dataset. This observation is almost certainly explained by differences in proband ascertainment for the two streams of testing, and these findings have implications for germline-variant classification using ACMG/AMP guidelines."

Utilizing these rules, classifications concordant with ClinVar assertions were achieved for 14/15 (93.3%) BEN/LBEN and 16/16 (100%) PATH/LPATH ClinVar consensus variants for an overall concordance of 96.8% (30/31). The variant where agreement was not reached was a synonymous variant near a splice donor with noncanonical sequence for which in silico models cannot predict the native site. Applying these rules to six VUS and five CONF variants, adding shared internal laboratory data enabled one VUS to be classified as LBEN and two CONF variants to be as classified as PATH and LPATH.

This has led to a paradigm shift in healthcare; caring for patients is now 99% information and 1% intervention. Reducing costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has made it possible to take genetic profiling to the clinical setting. This requires not just fast and accurate algorithms for variant detection, but also a knowledge-base for variant annotation and prioritization to facilitate tailored therapeutics based on an individual's genetic profile. Here we show that it is possible to provide a fast and easy access to all possible information about a variant and its impact on the gene, its protein product, associated pathways and drug-variant interactions by integrating previously reported knowledge from various databases. With this objective, we have developed a pipeline, Sequence Variants Identification and Annotation (SeqVItA) that provides end-to-end solution for small sequence variants detection, annotation and prioritization on a single platform. Parallelization of the variant detection step and with numerous resources incorporated to infer functional impact, clinical relevance and drug-variant associations, SeqVItA will benefit the clinical and research communities alike. Its open-source platform and modular framework allows for easy customization of the workflow depending on the data type (single, paired, or pooled samples), variant type (germline and somatic), and variant annotation and prioritization. Performance comparison of SeqVItA on simulated data and detection, interpretation and analysis of somatic variants on real data (24 liver cancer patients) is carried out. We demonstrate the efficacy of annotation module in facilitating personalized medicine based on patient's mutational landscape. SeqVItA is freely available at https://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/seqvita."

To date, less than 20 genes have been associated with MCHP, several of which are involved in the formation and function of the centrosome. Here, we report a novel missense variant in the TUBGCP5 gene in a patient with primary microcephaly and mild developmental delay. The TUBCGP5 gene (tubulin gamma complex associated protein 5) is a paralog of TUBGCP4 and TUBGCP6, both of which are known MCPH associated genes, and like its' paralogs, is involved in centrosome formation. Furthermore, the TUBGCP5 gene is located in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion Burnside-Butler susceptibility locus that is part of the larger Prader-Willi/Angelman region. Common clinical features of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion include general developmental and neurodevelopmental delay which may occasionally be accompanied by yet unexplained microcephaly. In our patient, the TUBGCP5:c.2180T > G, p.Phe727Cys missense variant was identified in compound heterozygous state with 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion using whole exome sequencing, after the initial analyses of known MCPH genes failed to identify a conclusively causative variant. The identified variant is rare and highly conserved, as shown by population allele frequency data from ExAC and GnomAD, as well as comparisons with all other vertebrates. Based on this evidence we suggest that the identified TUBGCP5 variant in our patient may thus represent a novel cause of MCPH with mild developmental delay and may play a role in occurrence of microcephaly in 15q11.2 microdeletion carriers. Further studies are required to further clarify the causality and penetrance of TBGCP5 variants in primary microcephaly."

Here we report on the phenotypic variability associated for this potential CRADD founder variant in 22 Finnish individuals. Exome sequencing was used to identify candidate genes in Finnish patients presenting with ID. Targeted Sanger sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis were applied to screen for the c.509G>A CRADD variant in cohorts from Finland. Detailed phenotyping and genealogical studies were performed. Twenty two patients were identified with the c.509G>A p.(Arg170His) homozygous variant in CRADD. The majority of the ancestors originated from Northeastern Finland indicating a founder effect. The hallmark of the disease is frontotemporal predominant pachygyria with mild cortical thickening. All patients show ID of variable severity. Aggressive behavior was found in nearly half of the patients, EEG abnormalities in five patients and megalencephaly in three patients. This study provides detailed data about the phenotypic spectrum of patients with lissencephaly due to a CRADD variant that affects function. High inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity was identified in patients with pachygyria caused by the homozygous CRADD founder variant. The phenotype variability suggests that additional genetic and/or environmental factors play a role in the clinical presentation. Since frontotemporal pachygyria is the hallmark of the disease, brain imaging studies are essential to support the molecular diagnosis for individuals with ID and a CRADD variant."

Herein, we have assessed the possible founder effect of PALB2 c.2257C>T (p.Arg753*) truncating variant among Greek breast cancer patients, while investigating possible correlations with cancer diagnoses. Following a lead deriving from a background study of highly selected Greek breast cancer patients, a total of 2496 breast and 697 ovarian cancer patients were directly genotyped for the PALB2 c.2257C>T truncating variant. Consequently, haplotype analysis was conducted on identified carriers, using seven microsatellite markers. The prevalence of the PALB2 variant was 0.24% (6/2496) and 0.14% (1/697) among breast and ovarian cases, respectively. Family history seems to be an important factor for the variant identification, although not reaching statistical significance. Microsatellite analysis on 12 carriers revealed a common shared haplotype, spanning a chromosomal region of ~1.2 Mb; the variant was possibly introduced in the Greek population ~1600 years ago. The variant confers high breast cancer risk, as illustrated by comparison with publicly available control groups. Genetic testing for PALB2, especially for the Greek founder c.2257C>T truncating variant, should be seriously considered in Greek breast cancer cases, since such findings could assist appropriate clinical management for the patients and their families."

Previous findings suggest that the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and its variants (i.e., frontal and temporo-limbic) may be related to the vulnerability of distinct functional connectivity networks. In this study, 82 bvFTD patients were included, and two patient groups were identified as frontal and temporo-limbic bvFTD variants. Two advanced multivariate analytical approaches were applied to FDG-PET data, i.e., sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) method and seed-based interregional correlation analysis (IRCA). These advanced methods allowed the assessment of (i) the whole-brain metabolic connectivity, without any a priori assumption, and (ii) the main brain resting-state networks of crucial relevance for cognitive and behavioural functions. In the whole bvFTD group, we found dysfunctional connectivity patterns in frontal and limbic regions and in all major brain resting-state networks as compared to healthy controls (HC N = 82). In the two bvFTD variants, SICE and IRCA analyses identified variant-specific reconfigurations of whole-brain connectivity and resting-state networks. Specifically, the frontal bvFTD variant was characterised by metabolic connectivity alterations in orbitofrontal regions and anterior resting-state networks, while the temporo-limbic bvFTD variant was characterised by connectivity alterations in the limbic and salience networks. These results highlight different neural vulnerabilities in the two bvFTD variants, as shown by the dysfunctional connectivity patterns, with relevance for the different neuropsychological profiles. This new evidence provides further insight in the variability of bvFTD and may contribute to a more accurate classification of these patients."

However, little is known about the biochemical properties of the exon α-containing Pol β (exon α Pol β) variant. Here, we first obtained evidence indicating expression of the 42 kDa exon α Pol β variant in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The exon α Pol β variant was then overexpressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized for its biochemical properties. Kinetic studies of exon α Pol β revealed that it is deficient in DNA binding to gapped DNA, has strongly reduced polymerase activity and higher Km for dNTP during gap-filling. On the other hand, the 5'-dRP lyase activity of the exon α Pol β variant is similar to that of wild-type Pol β.

A total of 383 in-house cases from 352 patients including 314 resection specimens and 69 biopsies from 2001 to 2014 were reviewed from a single institution. Histologic type, tumor grade, invasion, pathologic stage, nodal status, metastasis, and the presence and type of variant morphology for each case were evaluated. Variant morphology was identified in 5 biopsy specimens (7.2%) and 42 resection specimens (13.4%). The most common variant morphologic pattern was squamous differentiation (16 cases, 4.5%) followed by an inverted growth pattern (8 cases, 2.2%). The presence of variant morphology in resection specimens had a significant association with higher tumor grade, higher pT stage, and nonpapillary configuration. Of 69 patients with biopsies, 31 had a subsequent resection. In comparison, 181 consultation cases from 168 patients showed variant morphology in 6 biopsies (7.1%) and 27 resections (28.1%). In conclusion, the frequency of recognizing variant morphology in biopsies is about one-half of that in resections. The inclusion of consultation cases can inflate the incidence of variant morphology. As a result, the frequency of variant morphology in our in-house cases is lower than the percentage reported in the literature, most likely secondary to a consultation bias."

Importantly, gene-level concordance is not diminished for rare ECS conditions, suggesting that large panels do not balloon the panel-wide false-positive rate.

The other 2-year-old patient showed incipient signs of neurological involvement. In silico and cDNA sequencing studies showed that variant c.974dupG gives rise to skipping of exon 7. The expression of BSCL2-201 in fibroblasts was significantly higher in the index case than in the healthy child, although less than in the case with homozygous PELD due to c.985C>T variant.

We developed a bioinformatic solution to this problem-VarGrouper-that automatically recognizes individual variants that arise from a deletion-insertion variant and aggregates them into a single variant that can be properly annotated. This tool has been integrated into our routine clinical molecular diagnostics workflow for DNA sequencing of solid tumors. Over an 11-month period, VarGrouper variants were reported by all attending molecular pathologists involved in interpretation and represented 4.1% of all variants reported; 10.9% of cases with reportable variants contained at least one VarGrouper variant. VarGrouper improves the practice of molecular diagnostics by increasing the accuracy and consistency of variant annotation.

Thus, this study aimed to determine the implications of the variant on VWF functioning in vivo. Mice were engineered with humanized wild-type (WT*) VWF A1/A2 and VWF with the p.D1472H (1472H) variant along with humanized platelet GPIbα and bred to homozygosity. VWF antigen and VWF binding to GPIbα were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gel electrophoresis was used for VWF multimer analysis. Tail bleeding assays were performed at a 3-mm defined length. Normal VWF multimers were preserved in both WT* and 1472H mice. VWF expression was normal in the WT* and 1472H mice, and VWF binding to GPIbα did not statistically differ between the groups. Additionally, tail bleeding times were similar for WT* and 1472H mice. These results show the p.D1472H variant does not impair hemostasis in mice, and support the conclusion that p.D1472H is a normal variant in humans."

Therefore it is important to determine how variants of ABCG2 affect the transporter function in order to determine whether modified treatment regimens may be necessary for patients harboring ABCG2 variants. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between the ABCG2 Q141K variant and overall survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis. We report here that in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, those who carry the ABCG2 Q141K variant had a significantly shorter time to PSA recurrence post-prostatectomy than patients homozygous for wild-type ABCG2 (P=0.01). Transport studies showed that wild-type ABCG2 was able to efflux more folic acid than the Q141K variant (P<0.002), suggesting that retained tumoral folate contributes to the decreased time to PSA recurrence in the Q141K variant patients. In a seemingly conflicting study, it was previously reported that docetaxel-treated Q141K variant prostate cancer patients have a longer survival time. We found this may be due to less efficient docetaxel efflux in cells with the Q141K variant versus wild-type ABCG2. In human prostate cancer tissues, confocal microscopy revealed that all genotypes had a mixture of cytoplasmic and plasma membrane staining, with noticeably less staining in the two homozygous KK patients. In conclusion, the Q141K variant plays contrasting roles in prostate cancer: 1) by decreasing folate efflux, increased intracellular folate levels result in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and therefore time to recurrence decreases; and 2) in patients treated with docetaxel, by decreasing its efflux, intratumoral docetaxel levels and tumor cell drug sensitivity increase and therefore patient survival time increases. Taken together, these data suggest that a patient's ABCG2 genotype may be important when determining a personalized treatment plan."

However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P = .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011). Conclusion Specific ALK variants may be associated with the development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a molecular link between variant and clinical outcome. ALK variant thus represents a potentially important factor in the selection of next-generation ALK inhibitors."

However, a small subset of difficult-to-call variants that still do require orthogonal confirmation exist. For this reason, many clinical laboratories confirm NGS results using orthogonal technologies such as Sanger sequencing. Here, we report the development of a deterministic machine-learning-based model to differentiate between these two types of variant calls: those that do not require confirmation using an orthogonal technology (high confidence), and those that require additional quality testing (low confidence). This approach allows reliable NGS-based calling in a clinical setting by identifying the few important variant calls that require orthogonal confirmation."

Reclassification of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is expected, but other more certain calls, like pathogenic or benign, can also be reclassified once additional information is gathered. Variant reclassification can create difficult circumstances for both patients and clinicians.MethodsRetrospective review of all variant reclassifications in genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes at one clinic between September 2013 and February 2017 was completed. All variant reclassifications were completed and reported by the original testing laboratory.ResultsA total of 1,103 hereditary cancer tests were ordered. Fewer than 5% (40/1,103) of the initial reports were updated during that time period. Most reclassifications (29/40) were downgrades of VUS to likely benign. Only three reclassifications could potentially alter medical management.ConclusionThe majority of variant reclassifications do not impact medical management. Upgrading a variant call to pathogenic could be important for a patient's care and shows the importance of open communication between laboratories and clinicians.

It is generally important that enzyme preparations have no unwanted side activities. In the case of β-galactosidase preparations produced from K. lactis, an unwanted side activity could be the presence of arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1). Due to the action of arylsulfatase, an unpleasant ""cowshed-like"" off-flavor would occur in the final product. The best choice to avoid this is to use a yeast strain without this activity. Interestingly, we found that certain natural K. lactis strains express arylsulfatases, which only differ in one amino acid at position 139. The result of this difference is that K. lactis DSM 70799 (expressing R139 variant) shows no arylsulfatase activity, unlike K. lactis GG799 (expressing S139 variant). After recombinant production of both variants in Escherichia coli, the R139 variant remains inactive, whereas the S139 variant showed full activity. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the important posttranslational modification of C56 to formylglycine was not found in the R139 variant. By contrast, the C56 residue of the S139 variant was modified. We further investigated the packing and secondary structure of the arylsulfatase variants using optical spectroscopy, including fluorescence and circular dichroism. We found out that the inactive R139 variant exhibits a different structure regarding folding and packing compared to the active S139 variant. The importance of the amino acid residue 139 was documented further by the construction of 18 more variants, whereof only ten showed activity but always reduced compared to the native S139 variant."

Curation of the biomedical literature in an effort to extract this information is a challenging task due to: (i) the complexity of natural language processing, (ii) inconsistent use of standard recommendations for variant description, and (iii) the lack of clarity and consistency in describing the variant-genotype-phenotype associations in the biomedical literature. In this article, we employ text mining and word cloud analysis techniques to address these challenges. The proposed framework extracts the variant-gene-disease associations from the full-length biomedical literature and designs an evidence-based variant-driven gene panel for a given condition. We validate the identified genes by showing their diagnostic abilities to predict the patients' clinical outcome on several independent validation cohorts. As representative examples, we present our results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and prostate cancer. We compare these panels with other variant-driven gene panels obtained from Clinvar, Mastermind and others from literature, as well as with a panel identified with a classical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) approach. The results show that the panels obtained by the proposed framework yield better results than the other gene panels currently available in the literature."

From data mining, we found a novel prmt8e6+43 splicing variant with a 43-nucleotide (nt) extension at the 5' of exon 6 in chicken. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the existence of two splicing variants but also detected a third upper signal. The triplet pattern detected in chicken suggests that one strand from the prmt8e6+43 transcript and one strand from the regular splicing products form a heteroduplex with a bulb conformation and the two transcripts are of similar abundance. One short plus one faint upper heteroduplex signal detected in mouse and human indicate that the level of the variant is much less than the normal one in mammals. The relative expression of the normal and prmt8e6+43 variants in different species can be inferred from the reads of intron 5 that contains the 43-nt extension or not in the RNA-seq data of NCBI Gene database. The results of the analyses showed that the prmt8e6+43 variant is relatively abundant in birds but much less or even not detected in mammalian species. As conserved intron 5 sequences and evidences of alternative splicing (AS) are detected in elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish with the slowest-evolving genome, we propose that the prmt8e6+43 variant is present in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. The prmt8e6+43 variant includes a premature termination codon and thus should encode a truncated PRMT8 with deletion from the dimerization arm. Western blot analyses showed very weak low-molecular-weight signals in chicken, which might be the C-terminal truncated PRMT8. Why avian species maintain high RNA but not protein levels of the prmt8e6+43 variant and whether the evolutionary conserved sequence and AS might regulate PRMT8 expression require further investigation."

This condition is categorised as both a glycogen storage disease and a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Approximately 20 missense variants of PGM1 are linked to PGM1 deficiency, and biochemical studies have suggested that they fall into two general categories: those affecting the active site and catalytic efficiency, and those that appear to impair protein folding and/or stability. In this study, we characterise a novel variant of Arg422, a residue distal from the active site of PGM1 and the site of a previously identified disease-related variant (Arg422Trp). In prior studies, the R422W variant was found to produce insoluble protein in a recombinant expression system, precluding further in vitro characterisation. Here we investigate an alternative variant of this residue, Arg422Gln, which is amenable to experimental characterisation presumably due to its more conservative physicochemical substitution. Biochemical, crystallographic, and computational studies of R422Q establish that this variant causes only minor changes in catalytic efficiency and 3D structure, but is nonetheless dramatically reduced in stability. Unexpectedly, binding of a substrate analog is found to further destabilise the protein, in contrast to its stabilising effect on wild-type PGM1 and several other missense variants. This work establishes Arg422 as a lynchpin residue for the stability of PGM1 and supports the impairment of protein stability as a pathomechanism for variants that cause PGM1 deficiency. SYNOPSIS: Biochemical and structural studies of a missense variant far from the active site of human PGM1 identify a residue with a key role in enzyme stability."

Direct genomic sequencing of the coding regions of the GJA4 gene (encoding Cx37) was performed with the aim to identify a deleterious variant associated with POI and absent in ethnically matched controls. A single Cx37 variant absent in the control population was identified, namely a c.946G>A heterozygous substitution leading to a p.Gly316Ser variant that was present in two POI patients. This variant was absent in all Caucasian controls from various databases, and has been observed exclusively in African populations. This variant was identified to have a dominant negative effect in HeLa cells in vitro to alter connexon function (by 67.2±7.17%), as determined by Gap-fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The alteration principally resulted from a decrease of cell surface connexons due to altered trafficking (by 47.73±8.59%). In marked contrast to this observation, a p.Pro258Ser variant frequent in all ethnic populations in databases had no functional effect in vitro. In conclusion, the present study reported on a Cx37 variant in two Caucasian POI patients, which was absent in control Caucasian populations, and which had a deleterious effect in vitro. It is therefore suggested that in the genetic context of the Caucasian population, this variant may contribute to POI."

We refer to this as the penetrance, the fraction of all variant heterozygotes that will present with disease. We demonstrate this methodology using a well-established disease-gene pair, the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A and the heart arrhythmia Brugada syndrome. From a review of 756 publications, we developed a pattern mixture algorithm, based on a Bayesian Beta-Binomial model, to generate SCN5A penetrance probabilities for the Brugada syndrome conditioned on variant-specific attributes. These probabilities are determined from variant-specific features (e.g. function, structural context, and sequence conservation) and from observations of affected and unaffected heterozygotes. Variant functional perturbation and structural context prove most predictive of Brugada syndrome penetrance."

Classical single-marker association analyses for rare variants have limited power, and variant-set-based analyses are commonly used by researchers for analyzing rare variants. However, existing variant-set-based approaches need to pre-specify genetic regions for analysis; hence, they are not directly applicable to WGS data because of the large number of intergenic and intron regions that consist of a massive number of non-coding variants. The commonly used sliding-window method requires the pre-specification of fixed window sizes, which are often unknown as a priori, are difficult to specify in practice, and are subject to limitations given that the sizes of genetic-association regions are likely to vary across the genome and phenotypes. We propose a computationally efficient and dynamic scan-statistic method (Scan the Genome [SCANG]) for analyzing WGS data; this method flexibly detects the sizes and the locations of rare-variant association regions without the need to specify a prior, fixed window size. The proposed method controls for the genome-wise type I error rate and accounts for the linkage disequilibrium among genetic variants. It allows the detected sizes of rare-variant association regions to vary across the genome. Through extensive simulated studies that consider a wide variety of scenarios, we show that SCANG substantially outperforms several alternative methods for detecting rare-variant-associations while controlling for the genome-wise type I error rates. We illustrate SCANG by analyzing the WGS lipids data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study."

IB is one of the most highly contagious diseases, which results in many economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The nature of this virus is such that it generates new genotypes continuously. Proper vaccination is the most suitable way of combatting IB. One of the novel genotypes of IBV, which has been circulating in the Middle Eastern countries, is the variant 2 (IS-1494/GI-23) genotype. This study aims to design and produce an autogenous variant 2 vaccines. After isolation and characterization of the Iranian variant 2, the inactivated vaccine was formulated according to the OIE guidelines, and its different aspects (Purity, titration, inactivation, immunization) were evaluated. The designed vaccine passed all of OIE quality control standards. In the assessment process, the protection rate in the groups receiving the variant 2 and commercial vaccines was 67 % and 60 %, respectively. Although the differences were not significant, they indicated better protection, and the viral load in the feces and the kidney of the group receiving the variant 2 vaccine was lower than that in the commercial vaccine. It is suggested that the variant2 strain should be added as one of the local strains to the commercial inactivated vaccines in areas affected by this genotype. The use of this vaccine in layer and breeder flocks can help to protect them against variant 2 during the production phase. Also, the transfer of maternal antibodies to offspring can provide strain-specific immunity for one-day-old chickens."

Though patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia display changes in their pursuit of rewards, such as food, alcohol, money, and sex, the basis for these shifts is not clearly established. In particular, it is unknown whether patients' behaviour results from excessive focus on rewards, insensitivity to punishment, or to dysfunction in a particular stage of reward processing, such as anticipation, consumption, or action selection. Our goal was to determine the nature of the reward deficit in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and its underlying anatomy. We devised a series of tasks involving pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral olfactory stimuli, designed to separate distinct phases of reward processing. In a group of 25 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and 21 control subjects, diagnosis by valence interactions revealed that patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia rated unpleasant odours as less aversive than did controls and displayed lower skin conductance responses when anticipating an upcoming aversive odour. Subjective pleasantness ratings and skin conductance responses did not differ between behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and controls for pleasant or neutral smells. In a task designed to measure the effort subjects would expend to smell or avoid smelling a stimulus, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were less motivated, and therefore less successful than control subjects, at avoiding what they preferred not to smell, but had equivalent success at obtaining stimuli they found rewarding. Voxel-based morphometry of patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia revealed that the inability to subjectively differentiate the valence of pleasant and unpleasant odours correlated with atrophy in right ventral mid-insula and right amygdala. High pleasantness ratings of unpleasant stimuli correlated with left dorsal anterior insula and frontal pole atrophy. These findings indicate that insensitivity to negative information may be a key component of the reward-seeking behaviours in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and may relate to degeneration of structures that are involved in representing the emotional salience of sensory information."

Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that HOXB13 gene and protein expression did not differ between tumour samples from variant and wild-type carriers. Allele-specific transcription revealed that two of seven G84E carriers transcribed both the variant and wild-type allele, while five carriers transcribed the wild-type allele. Methylation of surrounding CpG sites was lower in the variant compared to the wild-type allele, however overall methylation across the region was very low. Notably, tumour characteristics were less aggressive in the two variant carriers that transcribed the variant allele compared to the five that did not. This study has shown that HOXB13 expression does not differ between tumour tissue of G84E variant carriers and non-carriers. Intriguingly, the G84E variant allele was rarely transcribed in carriers, suggesting that HOXB13 expression may be driven by the wild-type allele in the majority of carriers."

HPMRS, or Mabry syndrome, is now known to be one of 21 inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiencies (IGDs), or GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). Bi-allelic mutations in at least six genes result in HPMRS phenotypes. Disruption of four phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) biosynthesis genes, PIGV, PIGO, PIGW and PIGY, expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, result in HPMRS 1, 2, 5 and 6; disruption of the PGAP2 and PGAP3 genes, necessary for stabilizing the association of GPI anchored proteins (AP) with the Golgi membrane, result in HPMRS 3 and 4. We used exome sequencing to identify a novel homozygous missense PGAP2 variant NM_014489.3:c.881C > T, p.Thr294Met in two index patients and targeted sequencing to identify this variant in an unrelated patient. Rescue assays were conducted in two PGAP2 deficient cell lines, PGAP2 KO cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and PGAP2 deficient CHO cells, in order to examine the pathogenicity of the PGAP2 variant. First, we used the CHO rescue assay to establish that the wild type PGAP2 isoform 1, translated from transcript 1, is less active than the wild type PGAP2 isoform 8, translated from transcript 12 (alternatively spliced to omit exon 3). As a result, in our variant rescue assays, we used the more active NM_001256240.2:c.698C > T, p.Thr233Met isoform 8 instead of NM_014489.3:c.881C > T, p.Thr294Met isoform 1. Flow cytometric analysis showed that restoration of cell surface CD59 and CD55 with variant PGAP2 isoform 8, driven by the weak (pTA FLAG) promoter, was less efficient than wild type isoform 8. Therefore, we conclude that recessive inheritance of c.881C > T PGAP2, expressed as the hypomorphic PGAP2 c.698C > T, p.Thr233Met isoform 8, results in prototypical Mabry phenotype, HPMRS3 (GPIBD 8 [MIM: 614207]).

Microscopically, AFH is characterized by pseudovascular, blood-filled spaces that are surrounded by a multinodular proliferation of spindle and/or round cells and lymphoid cuffs. However, there is a wide morphological spectrum, including a myxoid variant. Examples with a prominent myxoid matrix are rare and may pose great diagnostic difficulty. Specific gene fusions have been found to play a significant role in AFH tumorigenesis. Gene fusions of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) with members of the cAMP response element-binding protein family (CREB) of transcription factors (CREB1, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), and cAMP response element modulator (CREM)) have been described in histopathologically diverse mesenchymal neoplasms such as AFH, hyalinising clear cell carcinomas of salivary glands, primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma. Classically, EWSR1-CREB is known to be the prominent gene fusion in AFH. Recently, a small series of intracranial mesenchymal tumors with EWSR1-CREB family gene fusions has been reported. These tumors seem to show histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenic features similar to those observed in the myxoid variant of AFH; therefore, there is a debate on whether these tumors merely represent a variant of AFH or a novel entity.

Following a series of pathological investigations, the diagnosis of an intracranial myxoid variant of AFH was made. This case report illustrates the need to consider the myxoid variant of intracranial AFH in the differential diagnosis of meningioma-like tumors. A high index of suspicion is required if the meningioma behaves abnormally with a much higher recurrence rate."

To address these challenges, ACMG/AMP published guidelines for variant interpretation in 2015. This study aimed to determine what impact these guidelines have on variant classification in clinical cardiovascular genetics. A retrospective chart review identified patients who underwent clinical genetic testing and had a variant identified in a gene associated with CVD. For each variant, systematic evidence review was performed and ACMG guidelines were applied for classification. These classifications were compared to those provided on patients' genetic test reports. This study identified 223 unique variants in 237 patients. Seventy-nine (35%) of the variants had classifications that differed from their clinical reports. Twenty-eight (35%) of these reclassifications would have changed medical management recommendations for 38 patients. Application of these guidelines resulted in reclassification for approximately one-third of the variants in this study. Clinicians can have a more active role in the process of variant classification. Variant classifications should be updated over time in the clinical CVD setting due to the impact reclassifications can have on clinical screening recommendations."

It is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and high levels of methylsuccinic, lactic, and ethylmalonic acids in body fluids. In this study, we report a patient with EE, who was identified through newborn screening, and the diagnosis was confirmed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The patient displayed recurrent petechiae, intermittent jaundice, protracted diarrhea, and extensive developmental regression. Genetic testing identified a homozygous nonsense variant, c.295C > T (p. Q99*), in the ETHE1 gene. A review of all known ETHE1 variants observed in other EE patients was conducted. This revealed the current difficulties in EE diagnosis. Besides, it also showed that patients with truncated variants of ETHE1 might exhibit pathological symptoms earlier and present more severe manifestations. Finally, a novel nonsense variant was identified, which supported and expanded our current knowledge of the variant spectrum for ETHE1. This novel variant also deepened our understanding of the genotype-phenotype associations that occur in EE patients."

In this report, we describe a 42-year-old female with Lynch syndrome who carries a germline variant, MLH1 c.678-3T>A, in the splice acceptor site of intron 8. Functional studies and semiquantitative analysis demonstrated that this variant causes a significant increase in the transcripts with exon 9 or exon 9 and 10 deletions, which presumably leads to premature protein truncation or abnormal protein. In addition, we also observed MSI-H and loss of MLH1 by IHC in patient's tumor tissue. This variant also segregated with Lynch Syndrome related cancers in three affected family members. Based on these evidence, the MLH1 c.678-3T>A variant is considered pathogenic."

METHODS Buccal swabs were collected from all cats in two BSH breeding catteries from the South Island and one from the North Island of New Zealand. DNA was extracted and was tested for the presence of the FASLG variant using PCR. Cats with the FASLG variant were identified and the frequency of the FASLG variant allele calculated. Pedigree analysis was performed and inbreeding coefficients were calculated for cats with the FASLG variant. RESULTS Of 32 BSH cats successfully tested for the presence of the FASLG variant, one kitten (3%) was homozygous (FALPS-affected), and seven (22%) cats were heterozygous (carriers) for the FASLG variant allele, and 24 (75%) cats were homozygous for the wild type allele. The overall frequency of the FASLG variant allele in these 32 cats was 0.14. Cats carrying the FASLG variant were from all three breeding catteries sampled, including two catteries that had not previously reported cases of FALPS. Pedigree analysis revealed common ancestry of FALPS-affected and carrier cats within six generations, as well as frequent inbreeding, with inbreeding coefficients >0.12 for five cats with the FASLG variant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE There was a high frequency of the FASLG variant allele (0.14) in this small sample of BSH cats, with 22% of healthy cats identified as carriers of the FASLG variant. For an inherited disease, lethal at a young age, in a small population in which inbreeding is common, these results are significant. To prevent future cases of disease and stop further spread of the FASLG variant allele within the BSH population in New Zealand, it is recommended that all BSH and BSH-cross cats be tested for the presence of the FASLG variant before mating. Cats identified as carriers of the variant allele should be desexed and not used for breeding. Results support the need for further investigations of the true frequency of the FASLG variant allele and occurrence of FALPS in the wider population of BSH cats in New Zealand."

Methods in which variants are grouped for analysis are also known as variant-set, gene-based, and aggregate unit tests. The burden test and sequence kernel association test (SKAT) are two widely used variant-set tests, which were originally developed for samples of unrelated individuals and later have been extended to family data with known pedigree structures. However, computationally efficient and powerful variant-set tests are needed to make analyses tractable in large-scale WGS studies with complex study samples. In this paper, we propose the variant-set mixed model association tests (SMMAT) for continuous and binary traits using the generalized linear mixed model framework. These tests can be applied to large-scale WGS studies involving samples with population structure and relatedness, such as in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. SMMATs share the same null model for different variant sets, and a virtue of this null model, which includes covariates only, is that it needs to be fit only once for all tests in each genome-wide analysis. Simulation studies show that all the proposed SMMATs correctly control type I error rates for both continuous and binary traits in the presence of population structure and relatedness. We also illustrate our tests in a real data example of analysis of plasma fibrinogen levels in the TOPMed program (n = 23,763), using the Analysis Commons, a cloud-based computing platform."

Homozygous variants of EMC1 are associated with GDD, scoliosis, and cerebellar atrophy, indicating the relevance of this pathway for neurogenetic disorders. EMC10 is a bone marrow-derived angiogenic growth factor that plays an important role in infarct vascularization and promoting tissue repair. However, this gene has not been previously associated with human disease. Herein, we describe a Saudi family with two individuals segregating a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. Both of the affected individuals showed mild ID, speech delay, and GDD. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify candidate genes. Further, to elucidate the functional effects of the variant, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)-based expression analysis was performed. WES revealed a homozygous splice acceptor site variant (c.679-1G>A) in EMC10 (chromosome 19q13.33) that segregated perfectly within the family. RT-qPCR showed a substantial decrease in the relative EMC10 gene expression in the patients, indicating the pathogenicity of the identified variant. For the first time in the literature, the EMC10 gene variant was associated with mild ID, speech delay, and GDD.

We investigated whether the African ancestry-specific PCa risk variant at 8q24, rs72725854, is enriched in men with a PCa family history in 9052 cases, 143 cases from high-risk families, and 8595 controls of African ancestry. We found the risk allele to be significantly associated with earlier age at diagnosis, more aggressive disease, and enriched in men with a PCa family history (32% of high-risk familial cases carried the variant vs 23% of cases without a family history and 12% of controls). For cases with two or more first-degree relatives with PCa who had at least one family member diagnosed at age <60 yr, the odds ratios for TA heterozygotes and TT homozygotes were 3.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13-7.22) and 33.41 (95% CI = 10.86-102.84), respectively. Among men with a PCa family history, the absolute risk by age 60 yr reached 21% (95% CI = 17-25%) for TA heterozygotes and 38% (95% CI = 13-65%) for TT homozygotes. We estimate that in men of African ancestry, rs72725854 accounts for 32% of the total familial risk explained by all known PCa risk variants. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that rs72725854, an African ancestry-specific risk variant, is more common in men with a family history of prostate cancer and in those diagnosed with prostate cancer at younger ages. Men of African ancestry may benefit from the knowledge of their carrier status for this genetic risk variant to guide decisions about prostate cancer screening."

Polymorphic differences between the two parental ChrXs may result in ChrX skewing of circulating WBCs (ChrX inactivation-ratio (XCI) > 3) driven by differences in stem cell selection and activity in the bone marrow or WBC trafficking at the periphery. Independent of the mechanism, ChrX skewing may result in genotype-phenotype discrepancies. This study aimed to develop an allele-specific assay and test its applicability in clinical samples to determine the ""direction"" of ChrX skewing in the variant IRAK1 haplotype, a common X-linked polymorphism with major clinical impacts. Because alternative splice variants of IRAK1 are also produced in the region surrounding the critical single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1059703), we also tested the abundance of alternative splice variant IRAK1 transcripts. The expression of splice variants IRAK1-B and IRAK1-C was about 30 and 50% of the full-length (IRAK1-A) in WBCs from healthy subjects (n = 53). IRAK1-A, B, and C showed about 30% lower expression level in males (n = 25) than females (n = 28). By contrast, the expression levels of IRAK1-A, B, and C were not affected by the variant IRAK1 haplotype in either sex. Allele-specific primers generated WT and variant-IRAK1 amplicons with high selectivity, and on average produced about half the expression levels of each transcript in heterozygous IRAK1-mosaic females. Because injury was shown to induce de novo ChrX skewing of WBCs, we tested the directional XCI ratio changes in WBC in a sample of trauma patients heterozygous for the variant IRAK1 haplotype (n = 18). Using the allele-specific assay in combination with the DNA methylation status at the polymorphic HUMARA locus, we found that at admission, about 60% the patients presented XCI ratios skewed toward WBCs with active ChrXs carrying the variant-IRAK1 similar to healthy controls. De novo, trauma-induced XCI ratio changes showed increased extravasation of the more abundant mosaic WBC subset without reversal in the direction of ChrX skewing during the injury course."

In the present study, a novel Msi1 transcript variant generated by alternative splicing was identified and termed Msi1 variant 2. This variant was observed to be ubiquitously expressed in cancerous and non-cancerous cells compared with its wild-type variant, which is preferentially expressed in cancer cells. Notably, the expression levels of Msi1 variant 2 were inversely associated with the protein expression levels of Msi1 in various cancer cells. This naturally truncated variant contains 899 nucleotides and a skipping event of exons 3 and 4, which leads to the emergence of a premature TGA stop codon in exon 5. The present results also demonstrated that hypoxia increased the resistance of H460 cells to cisplatin by suppressing the exon 3 and 4 skipping event of Msi1. In summary, the present study identified a novel splice variant of Msi1 lacking two complete RNA recognition motifs, and revealed the role of exon 3 and 4 skipping of Msi1 pre-mRNA in regulating cisplatin resistance under hypoxia. These observations indicate that targeting Msi1 alternative splicing could represent a valuable strategy to repress Msi1 signaling in tumors overexpressing this RNA-binding protein."

The human F11 gene comprises 15 exons, spanning over 23 kb of the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q35). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes typically show severe FXI deficiency, whereas heterozygotes show partial or mild deficiency. However, the genotype-phenotype relationship is difficult to establish, even among individuals within the same family. We report on a female patient with a heterozygous variant in F11 and FXI deficiency (49 IU/dL), who suffers from menorrhagia since menarche and easy bruising. She experienced excessive bleeding during thyroidectomy and after a cesarean section. Her younger sister, who carries the same heterozygous variant in F11 and has mild FXI deficiency (47 IU/dL), has menorrhagia without other bleeding difficulties although she has undergone several surgeries. Their father, who carries the same missense variant, has not experienced any bleeding difficulties (but he has not undergone any surgeries either). The family study revealed that the A428C mutation was inherited from the father. This variant has not previously been described in the literature and is the first F11 variant described in the Croatian population. Our study showed that even when family members have the same germline F11 variant, they still may experience phenotypic variability, making disease prognosis more complex."

Trypanosoma vivax is a related, livestock pathogen whose VSG lack structures that facilitate gene conversion in T. brucei and mechanisms underlying its antigenic diversity are poorly understood. Here we show that species-wide VSG repertoire is broadly conserved across diverse T. vivax clinical strains and has limited antigenic repertoire. We use variant antigen profiling, coalescent approaches and experimental infections to show that recombination plays little role in diversifying T. vivax VSG sequences. These results have immediate consequences for both the current mechanistic model of antigenic variation in African trypanosomes and species differences in virulence and transmission, requiring reconsideration of the wider epidemiology of animal African trypanosomiasis."

Here, we describe charge variant native mass spectrometry (CVMS), an integrated native ion exchange mass spectrometry-based charge variant analytical approach that delivers detailed molecular information in a single, semi-automated analysis. We utilized pure volatile salt mobile phases over a pH gradient that effectively separated variants based on minimal differences in isoelectric point. Characterization of variants such as deamidation, which are traditionally unattainable by intact mass due to their minimal molecular weight differences, were measured unambiguously by mass and retention time to allow confident MS1 identification. We demonstrate that efficient chromatographic separation allows introduction of the purified forms of the charge variant isoforms into the Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Our CVMS method allows confident assignment of intact monoclonal antibody isoforms of similar mass and relative abundance measurements across three orders of magnitude dynamic range."

Our previous exome-wide analyses found a Val1937Ile variant (rs17848945) in the 34th exon of fatty acid synthase (FASN) that showed a strong association with the risk of ESCC. In this study, we performed a series of functional assays to investigate the biological functions underlying this variant in the development of ESCC. We demonstrated that FASN was upregulated in ESCC and both knockdown and knockout of FASN significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoter role for this gene in ESCC. Furthermore, the results showed that overexpression of FASN[I] in the ESCC cells substantially enhanced cell proliferation, compared with overexpression of FASN[V], or the control vector. Intriguingly, we found that the FASN[I] variant can enhance the enzyme activity of FASN, and, thus, increase the amount of the FASN end-product, palmitate in the ESCC cells. We also observed elevated palmitate levels in the plasma of the FASN[I] genotype carriers among a total of 632 healthy Chinese adults. In conclusion, our results suggested that the FASN V1937I variant influenced ESCC cell proliferation and susceptibility by altering the catabolic activity of FASN on palmitate. These findings may highlight an important role of palmitate metabolism in the development of ESCC and may contribute to the personalized medicine of this disease."

The variant hemoglobin group reported #C fraction values of ≤1.3% in twelve subjects, ≥2.3% in five subjects, and within the reference range (1.4-2.2%) in three subjects. When the cutoff values of #C fraction were set at ≤1.3% and ≥2.3%, sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 100%, respectively. Most non-diabetic subjects with variant hemoglobin showed abnormal values of #C fraction. Measurement of #C fraction is a useful screening test for variant hemoglobin in non-diabetic subjects. "

The detection of F. necrophorum was carried out by PCR targeting the lktA gene fragment and identification of lktA variant strains was done by PCR-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and gene sequencing. Of the 450 swabs collected from footrot lesions of sheep, 117 were lktA-positive for F. necrophorum. Of the 50 swabs collected from apparently asymptomatic sheep, only one was lktA-positive for F. necrophorum. The overall prevalence of F. necrophorum in footrot affected sheep in Kashmir valley was 26%, and ranged from 20 to 34.8%, respectively. PCR-SSCP of lktA gene fragment analysis revealed three lktA variants, designated as JKS-F1/F2/F3, while two samples (1.7%) showed multiple lktA variant strains of F. necrophorum in a single footrot-affected sheep hoof. This appears to be the first report on the presence of more than one lktA variant of F. necrophorum in a footrot lesion of sheep. The JKS-F3 lktA variant was the most frequent (75.4%), followed by JKS-F2 (14.4%) and JKS-F1 (8.4%), respectively. Among the three lktA variants identified, JKS-F3 was detected in 74 (86.0%) samples from severe footrot affected sheep with a lesion score of 4. The data suggest that JKS-F3 is the predominant lktA variant of F. necrophorum and is associated with severe footrot in sheep. Hence, JKS-F3 may be a significant variant contributing to the severity and duration of the disease in sheep."

Deep investigation of the region resulted in one identified variant, the rs34311866 missense SNP (p.M393T) in TMEM175, which is 20 orders of magnitude more significant than any other SNP in the region. Because TMEM175 is a lysosomal gene that has been shown to influence α-synuclein phosphorylation and autophagy, the p.M393T variant is an attractive candidate, and we have examined its effect on TMEM175 protein and PD-related biology. After knocking down each of the genes located under the GWAS peak via multiple shRNAs, only TMEM175 was found to consistently influence accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn). Examination of the p.M393T variant showed effects on TMEM175 function that were intermediate between the wild-type (WT) and knockout phenotypes, with reduced regulation of lysosomal pH in response to starvation and minor changes in clearance of autophagy substrates, reduced lysosomal localization, and increased accumulation of p-α-syn. Finally, overexpression of WT TMEM175 protein reduced p-α-syn, while overexpression of the p.M393T variant resulted in no change in α-synuclein phosphorylation. These results suggest that the main signal in the chromosome 4p16.3 PD risk locus is driven by the TMEM175 p.M393T variant. Modulation of TMEM175 may impact α-synuclein biology and therefore may be a rational therapeutic strategy for PD."

This study included 253 Kuwaiti children with T1DM and 214 ethnically matched controls. The genotypes of PTPN22 gene functional variant C1858T (R620W; rs2476601) were detected by PCR-RFLP method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. HLA-DQ and DR alleles were determined by sequence-specific PCR. Three autoantibodies were detected in the T1DM patients using radio-immunoassays. A significant association was detected between the variant genotype of the PTPN22 gene (C1858T, rs2476601) and T1DM in Kuwaiti Arabs. HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles showed a strong association with T1DM. In T1DM patients which carried the variant TT-genotype of the PTPN22 gene, 93% had at least one DQ2 allele and 60% carried either a DQ2 or a DQ8 allele. Amongst the DR alleles, the DR3-DRB5, DR3-3, DR3-4 and DR4-4 showed a strong association with T1DM. Majority of T1DM patients who carried homozygous variant (TT) genotype of the PTPN22 gene had either DR3-DRB5 or DRB3-DRB4 genotypes. In T1DM patients who co-inherited the high risk HLA DQ, DR alleles with the variant genotype of PTPN22 gene, the majority were positive for three autoantibodies. Our data demonstrate that the variant T-allele of the PTPN22 gene along with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 alleles constitute significant determinants of genetic predisposition of T1DM in Kuwaiti children."

Four hundred and twenty patients (age 17-60 years) were analyzed for the TERT A1062T variant by direct sequencing. Fifteen patients (3.6%) carried the TERT A1062T variant. Patients with the TERT A1062T variant had a trend towards less favorable and more intermediate 2/adverse karyotypes/genotypes according to the European Leukemia Net classification. In univariate and multivariate analysis, patients with the TERT A1062T variant had a significantly inferior overall survival compared to wild-type patients (6-year overall survival 20 vs. 41%, p = 0.005). Patients with the TERT A1062T variant showed a high rate of treatment-related mortality: 5/15 (33%) died during induction therapy or in complete remission as compared to 62/405 (15%) of the wild-type patients. In patients with the TERT variant, 14/15 (93%) suffered from non-hematological/non-infectious grade 3/4 adverse events (mostly hepatic and/or mucosal) as compared to 216/405 (53%) wild-type patients (p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the TERT A1062T variant was an independent risk factor predicting for adverse events during induction chemotherapy. In conclusion, the TERT A1062T variant is an independent negative prognostic factor in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia and seems to predispose those patients to treatment-related toxicity."

The ACE I/D polymorphism has been associated with athletic performance in some studies. Studies have suggested that the ACE I/D gene variant is associated with ACE enzyme content in serum, and there is an interaction between ACE and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3). However, no studies have explored the effect of ACE I/D on ACE, UCP2, and UCP3 protein content in human skeletal muscle. Utilizing the Gene SMART cohort ( n = 81), we investigated whether the ACE I/D gene variant is associated with ACE enzyme content in blood and ACE, UCP2, and UCP3 protein content in skeletal muscle at baseline and following a session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Using a stringent and robust statistical analyses, we found that the ACE I/D gene variant was associated with ACE enzyme content in blood ( P < 0.005) at baseline but not the ACE, UCP2, and UCP3 protein content in muscle at baseline. A single session of HIIE tended (0.005 < P < 0.05) to increase blood ACE content immediately postexercise, whereas muscle ACE protein content was lower 3 h after a single session of HIIE ( P < 0.005). Muscle UCP3 protein content decreased immediately after a single session of HIIE ( P < 0.005) and remained low 3 h postexercise. However, those changes in the muscle were not genotype dependent.

An intensive wildlife rabies control program, in which field operations were initiated in 1989, resulted in elimination of the disease in eastern Ontario. However in southwestern Ontario, as numbers of rabid foxes declined the proportion of skunks confirmed to be infected with this rabies virus variant increased and concerted control efforts targeting this species were employed to eliminate the disease. Since 2012 no cases due to this viral variant were reported in southwestern Ontario until 2015 when a single case of rabies due to the arctic fox variant was reported in a bovine. Several additional cases have been documented subsequently. Since routine antigenic typing cannot discriminate between the variants which previously circulated in Ontario and those from northern Canada it was unknown whether these recent cases were the result of a new introduction of this variant or a continuation of the previous enzootic. To explore the origins of this new outbreak whole genome sequences of a collection of 128 rabies viruses recovered from Ontario between the 1990s to the present were compared with those representative of variants circulating in the Canadian north. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the variant responsible for current cases in southwestern Ontario has evolved from those variants known to circulate in Ontario previously and is not due to a new introduction from northern regions. Thus despite ongoing passive surveillance the persistence of wildlife rabies went undetected in the study area for almost three years. The apparent adaptation of this rabies virus variant to the skunk host provided the opportunity to explore coding changes in the viral genome which might be associated with this host shift. Several such changes were identified including a subset for which the operation of positive selection was supported. The location of a small number of these amino acid substitutions in or close to protein motifs of functional importance suggests that some of them may have played a role in this host shift."

Most APDs are sporadic, but rare familial forms have also been reported. Epidemiological and post-mortem studies associated APDs with oxidative stress and cellular protein aggregates. Identifying molecular mechanisms that translate stress into toxic protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in APDs is an active area of research. Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) stress granule (SG) pathways were discussed to be pathogenically relevant in several neurodegenerative disorders including APDs. Using whole genome sequencing, mRNA expression analysis, transfection assays and cell imaging, we investigated the genetic and molecular basis of a familial neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonian disorder. We investigated a family with six living members in two generations exhibiting clinical symptoms consistent with atypical parkinsonism. Two affected family members suffered from parkinsonism that was associated with ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these patients showed brainstem and cerebellar atrophy. Whole genome sequencing identified a heterozygous stop-gain variant (c.C811T; p.R271X) in the Poly(A) binding protein, cytoplasmic 4-like (PABPC4L) gene, which co-segregated with the disease in the family. In situ hybridization showed that the murine pabpc4l is expressed in several brain regions and in particular in the cerebellum and brainstem. To determine the functional impact of the stop-gain variant in the PABPC4L gene, we investigated the subcellular localization of PABPC4L in heterologous cells. Wild-type PABPC4L protein localized predominantly to the cell nucleus, in contrast to the truncated protein encoded by the stop-gain variant p.R271X, which was found homogeneously throughout the cell. Interestingly, the wild-type, but not the truncated protein localized to RasGAP SH3 domain Binding Protein (G3BP)-labeled cytoplasmic granules in response to oxidative stress induction. This suggests that the PABPC4L variant alters intracellular distribution and possibly the stress granule associated function of the protein, which may underlie APD in this family. In conclusion, we present genetic and molecular evidence supporting the role of a stop-gain PABPC4L variant in a rare familial APD. Our data shows that the variant results in cellular mislocalization and inability of the protein to associate with stress granules."

A series of six confidence thresholds for single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels from the exome data were applied to generate customized sequence databases of different stringency. In the searches against unfiltered databases, between 100 and 160 variant peptides were identified for each of the cell lines using X!Tandem and MS-GF+ search engines. The recovery rate for variant peptides was ∼1%, which is approximately three times lower than that of the wild-type peptides. Using unfiltered genomic databases for variant searches resulted in higher sensitivity and selectivity of the proteogenomic workflow and positively affected the ability to distinguish the cell lines based on variant peptide signatures."

One method to achieve this pairs microfluidic PCR with next generation sequencing. The PCR step of this pipeline creates challenges in accurate variant calling. This includes that most reads targeting a specific exon are duplicates that have been amplified from the PCR step. To reduce false positive variant calls from these experiments, previous studies have used threshold-based filtering of alternative allele depth ratio and manual inspection of the alignments. However even after manual inspection and filtering, many variants fail to be validated via Sanger sequencing. To improve the accuracy of variant calling from these experiments, we are challenged to design a variant filtering strategy that sufficiently models microfluidic PCR-specific issues."

The virus was easily grown in GPV antibody-free goose embryos and caused high mortality and severe lesions of goose embryos, indicating that the variant GPV has good adaptation and high pathogenicity to embryonated goose eggs similar to the classical GPV. Like the third egg-passage virus (strain H) of a classical GPV, the third egg-passage virus (strain JS1) of the variant GPV caused Derzsy's disease in 2-day-old goslings with high mortality. The findings suggest that the variant GPV strain, which had specifically adapted to Pekin ducks, still retained high pathogenicity for its original host. The mortality (73.3-80%) caused by the first and third egg-passages of the variant GPV was somewhat lower than that (93.3%) caused by the third passage virus of the classical GPV, reflecting the higher pathogenicity of the classical GPV for its original host.

Furthermore, focusing on the fibrillinopathies Marfan syndrome (MFS) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), we screened 500 genomes of our patients for co-occurring variants in FBN1 and FBN2. In gnomAD, we detected 2653 (likely) pathogenic variants in 253 genes associated with autosomal-dominant disorders, enabling the estimation of variant-filtering thresholds and disease predisposition/prevalence rates. In our database, we discovered two families with hitherto unreported co-occurrence of FBN1/FBN2 variants causing phenotypes with mixed or modified MFS/CCA clinical features. We show that (likely) pathogenic gnomAD variants may be more frequent than expected and are challenging to classify according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines as well as that fibrillinopathies are likely underdiagnosed and may co-occur. Consequently, selection of appropriate frequency cutoffs, recognition of digenic variants, and variant classification represent considerable challenges in variant interpretation.

More than 50 genes are responsible for SRNS. One such gene is the nucleoporin, 93-KD (NUP93). Thus far, few studies have reported mutations of NUP93 in SRNS. Here, we describe an NUP93 biallelic mutation in a 9-year-old boy with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). Notably, one mutation comprised an intronic variant; we conducted in vivo and in vitro analysis to characterize this variant. We found two heterozygous mutations in NUP93: c.2137-18G>A in intron 19 and a novel nonsense mutation c.727A>T (p.Lys243*) in exon 8. We conducted RNA sequencing and in vitro splicing assays by using minigene construction, combined with protein expression analysis to determine the pathogenicity of the intronic variant. Both RNA sequencing and in vitro splicing assay showed exon 20-skipping by the intronic variant. In protein expression analysis, aberrant subcellular localization with small punctate vesicles in the cytoplasm was observed for the intronic variant. Taken together, we concluded that c.2137-18G>A was linked to pathogenicity due to aberrant splicing. NUP93 variants are quite rare; however, we have shown that even intronic variants in NUP93 can cause SRNS. This study provides a fundamental approach to validate the intronic variant, as well as new insights regarding the clinical spectrum of SRNS caused by rare gene variants."

Physiologically active hCC is a monomer. However, all structural studies based on crystallization led to the dimeric structure formed as a result of a three-dimensional exchange of the protein domains (3D domain swapping). The monomeric structure was obtained only for hCC variant V57N and for the protein stabilized by an additional disulfide bridge. With this study, we extend the number of models of monomeric hCC by an additional hCC variant with a single amino acid substitution in the flexible loop L1.

We have previously demonstrated a form of canine dilated cardiomyopathy in the Doberman pinscher breed that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is associated with a splice site variant in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene, however, genetic heterogeneity exists in this species as well and not all affected dogs have the PDK4 variant. Whole genome sequencing of a family of Doberman pinchers with dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death without the PDK4 variant was performed. A pathologic missense variant in the titin gene located in an immunoglobulin-like domain in the I-band spanning region of the molecule was identified and was highly associated with the disease (p < 0.0001).

This large animal model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy shares many similarities with the human disease including mode of inheritance, clinical presentation, genetic heterogeneity and a pathologic variant in the titin gene.

In some applications, this characteristic can be deleterious, for example, resulting in inductive loss through eddy currents in motors designed for high efficiency operation. Therefore, it is important to investigate the electrical dynamics of systems with time-variant inductors. However, circuit analysis with time-variant inductors is nonlinear, resulting in difficulties in obtaining a closed form solution. Typical numerical algorithms used to solve the nonlinear differential equations are time consuming and require powerful processors. This investigation proposes a nonlinear method to analyze a system model consisting of the time-variant inductor with a constraint that the circuit is powered by DC sources and the derivative of the inductor is known. In this method, the Norton equivalent circuit with the time-variant inductor is realized first. Then, an iterative solution using a small signal theorem is employed to obtain an approximate closed form solution. As a case study, a variable inductor, with a time-variant part stimulated by a sinusoidal mechanical excitation, is analyzed using this approach. Compared to conventional nonlinear differential equation solvers, this proposed solution shows both improved computation efficiency and numerical robustness. The results demonstrate that the proposed analysis method can achieve high accuracy."

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) combined with small airway functional parameters in cough variant asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS Children with asthma (n=136) were divided into a cough variant asthma (CVA) group (n=57; mean age, 8.03±2.1 years) and a non-cough variant asthma (nCVA) group (n=79; mean age, 8.61±1.7 years). In both groups, FeNO and other pulmonary function parameters were measured including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), forced expiratory flow (FEF), and maximum expiratory flow at 25%, 50%, and 75% expired volume (MEF25, MEF50, and MEF75). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis compared the sensitivity and specificity between the diagnostic parameters. RESULTS The FeNO values were significantly increased in the CVA group compared with the nCVA group (Z=6.890, p<0.001). The MMEF, MEF25, MEF50, and MEF75 values were significantly lower in the CVA group compared with the nCVA group (p=0.000, p=0.014, p=0.000, and p=0.000, respectively). The FeNO values were negatively correlated with MEF25, MEF50, and MMEF (ρ=-0.334, ρ=-0.257 and ρ=-0.276, respectively). FeNO was significantly more efficient diagnosing cough variant asthma comparing with pulmonary parameters (p<0.05), and was most sensitive and specific when combined with MMEF/MEF50 compared with single diagnostic parameters (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS FeNO combined with pulmonary function parameters of MMEF/MEF50 showed increased sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of cough variant asthma."

We described a severely affected FH proband and their first-degree blood relatives; the proband was resistant to statin therapy and was managed on an LDL apheresis program. In order to find the causative genetic variant in this family, direct exon sequencing of the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes was performed. We identified a compound heterozygous mutation in the proband with missense p.(W577C) and frameshift p.(G676Afs33) variants at exons 12 and 14 of the LDLR gene respectively. DNA sequencing of LDLR gene from the parents demonstrated that the missense variant was inherited from the mother and frameshift variant was inherited from the father. The frameshift variant resulted in a stop signal 33 codons downstream of the deletion, which most likely led to a truncated protein that lacks important functional domains, including the trans-membrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail domain. The missense variant is also predicted to be likely pathogenic and affect EGF-precursor homology domain of the LDLR protein. The segregation pattern of the variants was consistent with the lipid profile, suggesting a more severe FH phenotype when the variants are in the compound heterozygous state. The finding of a compound heterozygous mutation causing severe FH phenotype is important for the genotype-phenotype correlation and also enlarges the spectrum of FH-causative LDLR variants in the Arab population, including the Saudi population."

Moreover, we demonstrated that human NPT1 is localized to the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubule, and that I269T is the gain-of-function variant which increases the NPT1-mediated urate export. However, the mechanism by which I269T variant increases the urate export remains to be clarified. Thus, we performed immunostaining and functional analysis of human NPT1 using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. For comparison of human NPT1 expression levels of oocyte membrane between 269I (wild type) and 269T (variant), immunostaining was performed with anti-human NPT1 antibodies. As a result, we showed that NPT1 I269T variant did not change the human NPT1 membrane expression levels, although NPT1 I269T variant increased the urate transport compared with NPT1 wild type. Combined with the previous report that I269T variant did not induce Km changes but increased the Vmax of urate transport in a proteoliposome system, our findings suggest that I269T variant increases NPT1-mediated urate export without increase of NPT1 expression levels on the membrane. Thus, I269T, a common missense variant of NPT1, might have faster conformation changes than NPT1 wild type in terms of the alternating-access model of transporters, and increases renal urate export in humans."

However, challenges exist in paired tumor-normal testing, including increased cost of dual sample testing and identification of germline cancer predisposing variants. Alternatively, somatic variants can be identified by in silico tumor-only variant filtration precluding the need for matched normal testing. The barrier to tumor-only variant filtration is defining a reliable approach, with high sensitivity and specificity to identify somatic variants. In this study, we used retrospective data sets from paired tumor-normal samples tested on small (48 gene) and large (555 gene) targeted next-generation sequencing panels, to model algorithms for tumor-only variants classification. The optimal algorithm required an ordinal filtering approach using information from variant population databases (1000 Genomes Phase 3, ESP6500, ExAC), clinical mutation databases (ClinVar), and information on recurring clinically relevant somatic variants. Overall the tumor-only variant filtration strategy described in this study can define clinically relevant somatic variants from tumor-only analysis with sensitivity of 97% to 99% and specificity of 87% to 94%, and with significant potential utility for clinical laboratories implementing tumor-only molecular profiling."

We used data from 80 patients who underwent singleton whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the ability of the framework to rank causative variants highly, and compared it against the performance of other gene and variant prioritization tools. Causative variants were identified in 59 of the patients. Using the MGHA prioritization framework the average rank of the causative variant was 2.24, with 76% ranked as the top priority variant, and 90% ranked within the top five.

Approximately 5%-10% of SMA patients are believed to have SMN1 variants. c.22 dupA (p.Ser8lysfs*23) has been identified as the most frequent variant in the Chinese SMA population and to be associated with a severe phenotype. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the variant on the pathogenesis of SMA is unclear. We observed that SMN1 mRNA and the SMN protein in the peripheral blood cells of a patient with c.22 dupA were lower than those of controls. The aim of this study is to investigate whether nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) plays a role in the mechanism of the c.22 dupA variant of the SMN1 gene as it causes SMA. Two lymphoblasts cell lines from two patients (patient 1 and 2) with the c.22 dupA, and one dermal fibroblasts cell line from patient 2 were included in our study. Two-stage validation of the NMD mechanism was supplied. We first measured the changes in the transcript levels of the SMN1 gene by real-time quantitative PCR after immortalized B-lymphoblasts and dermal fibroblasts cells of the SMA patients were treated with inhibitors of the NMD pathway, including puromycin and cyclohemide. Next, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of the key NMD factor-Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)-was performed in the fibroblasts cell line to further clarify whether the variant led to NMD, as UPF1 recognizes abnormally terminated transcripts as NMD substrates during translation. SC35 1.7-kb transcripts, a physiological NMD substrate was determined to be a NMD positive gene in our experiments. The two inhibitors resulted in a dramatic escalation of the levels of the full-length SMN1 (fl-SMN1) transcripts. Additionally, the SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels were also increased, suggesting that NMD pathway is suppressed by the two inhibitors. For the 3 cell lines, the fold increase of the SMN1 transcript levels of cycloheximide ranged from 2.5±0.4 to 8.3±0.1, 1.9±0.2 to 5.0±0.7 and 2.2±0.1 to 4.9±0.2 for two lymphoblastoid cell lines and one fibroblasts cell line, respectively. For these cell lines, the fold increases of the SMN1 transcript levels of puromycin were as follows: 5.5±0.2 to 19.5±4.0, 3.1±0.3 to 9.9±1.8 and 1.5±0.2 to 6.5±0.5. Meanwhile, the SC35 1.7-kb transcript levels were markedly increased in all 3 cell lines. In addition, lentivirus-mediated UPF1 knockdown lead to a reduction of the UPF1 protein level to 22.5% compared to the negative control lentivirus. Additionally, knockdown of the UPF1 gene also promoted mRNA expression of the SC35 1.7kb and fl-SMN1 genes. The increases of the SMN1 and SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels reached about 4- and 6.5-fold in fibroblasts derived from the patient 2, respectively. Altogether, our study provides the first evidence that the c.22 dupA variant in the SMN1 gene triggers NMD. SMA pathogenesis in the patient is associated with mRNA degradation of SMN1, but not the truncated SMN protein."

It has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, hence is more prevalent in populations with frequent consanguineous marriages that occur in the Pakistani population. Mutations in the CYP1B1 gene are commonly associated with PCG. The aim of the present study was to identify genetic mutations in the CYP1B1 gene in PCG cases belonging to 38 Pakistani families. DNA was extracted using blood samples collected from all enrolled patients, their available unaffected family members and controls. Direct sequencing of the CYP1B1 gene revealed a novel 3' splice acceptor site causative variant segregating in an autosomal recessive manner in a large consanguineous family with four PCG-affected individuals. The novel variant was not detected in 93 ethnically matched controls. Furthermore, four already reported mutations, including p.G61E, p.R355X, p.R368H, and p.R390H were also detected in patients belonging to nine different families. All identified causative variants were evaluated by computational programs, that is, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and MutationTaster. Pathogenicity of the novel splice site variant identified in this study was analyzed by Human Splicing Finder and MaxEntScan. Ten out of 38 families with PCG had the disease due to CYP1B1 mutations, suggesting CYP1B1 was contributing to PCG in these Pakistani patients. Identification of this novel 3' splice acceptor site variant in intron 2 is the first report for the CYP1B1 gene contributing to genetic heterogeneity of disease."

Numerous variant association studies for this MMD variant have been performed in Japan to date. Since another genetic study that utilized approximately 140,000 single nucleotide polymor (SNPs) has indicated that there still are genetic differences among mainland Japanese, there is a possibility that the variant distribution in patients with MMD and normal individuals varies between different Japanese regions. Additionally, the majority of variant association studies have used Sanger sequencing, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In this study, we analyzed the frequency of the variant genotype in patients with MMD and normal individuals in Kyushu using pyrosequencing, which is an accurate, cost-effective, and automated method. We found differences in the genotype frequencies in familial patients from Kyushu and normal populations in Tohoku compared with west Japan, which suggested that there were differences in the frequency of the variant among different regions in Japan."

Youth who have close and prolonged contact with influenza-infected swine at agricultural fairs may be at increased risk of acquiring influenza virus infection from swine. Animal and human health officials have issued written measures to minimize influenza transmission at agricultural exhibitions; however, there is little information on the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of these measures among animal exhibitors. After an August 2016 outbreak of influenza A(H3N2) variant (""H3N2v"") virus infections (i.e., humans infected with swine influenza viruses) in Michigan, we surveyed households of animal exhibitors at eight fairs (including one with known H3N2v infections) to assess their KAP related to variant virus infections and their support for prevention measures. Among 170 households interviewed, most (90%, 151/167) perceived their risk of acquiring influenza from swine to be low or very low. Animal exhibitor households reported high levels of behaviours that put them at increased risk of variant influenza virus infections, including eating or drinking in swine barns (43%, 66/154) and hugging, kissing or snuggling with swine at agricultural fairs (31%, 48/157). Among several recommendations, including limiting the duration of swine exhibits and restricting eating and drinking in the animal barns, the only recommendation supported by a majority of households was the presence of prominent hand-washing stations with a person to monitor hand-washing behaviour (76%, 129/170). This is a unique study of KAP among animal exhibitors and highlights that animal exhibitor households engage in behaviours that could increase their risk of variant virus infections and have low support for currently recommended measures to minimize infection transmission. Further efforts are needed to understand the lack of support for recommended measures and to encourage healthy behaviours at fairs."

We used 1,073 extensively phenotyped AD cases with relatively young age at onset as extreme cases (66.3 ± 7.9 years), 1,664 age-matched controls (66.0 ± 6.5 years) and 255 cognitively healthy centenarians as extreme controls (101.4 ± 1.3 years).

By analysis of whole-genome sequencing data of one CCR we identified a novel genetic cause for curly fur. We found a novel structural variant in exon 7 of the KRT71 gene (c.1266_1273delinsACA) that was predicted to result in a frameshift and stop loss, therefore significantly affecting the structure of the protein, if translated. The variant was also found at lower frequencies in five other breeds, including Lagotto Romagnolo, Bichon Frise, Spanish Water Dog, Chesapeake Bay Retriever and Irish Terrier. One curly-coated Lagotto carried neither of the two KRT71 variants. These results identify a second variant for curly coat in KRT71 and suggest the existence of additional alleles. This study enables the development of an additional KRT71 gene test for breeders to understand and manage coat types."

It depicts the heterogeneity of charge variant forms, some of which may differ by only minor modifications of a single amino acid. The analysis ensures product consistency with no unwanted changes to the protein. With increasing numbers of new mAb drug products emerging in the market, the need for a robust charge variant analysis has intensified. The charge variant profiles often display partially resolved peaks on shoulders of larger peaks. This puts considerably more pressure on the robustness of the method to maintain the suboptimum selectivity. New products and techniques have emerged to address these requirements, in addition to the pre-existing older methods that may not have been optimized correctly in the past. This has led to some confusion as to the best approach and strategies in optimization of charge variant analysis. We show studies from several different approaches using on-line pH monitoring to check the performance characteristics of the methods. This has led to new insights on the interactions between the protein, column, and buffer constituents. We dispel some inaccurate assumptions about the different ion-exchange elution mechanisms and suggest ways to develop high-throughput methods that remain robust and of high resolution. Streamlined automatable method development tools are presented that will result in more efficient method optimization. The mechanisms behind poor chromatography design have provided an alternative explanation behind some methods failing when in the QC laboratories."

FXIII deficiency is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Severe phenotypes lead to spontaneous, traumatic and surgical bleeding. Umbilical cord bleeding is especially common, and intracranial bleeding may occur in up to one third of patients without prophylaxis. In this work, we used NGS for screening all the coding and intronic boundary regions of F13A1 and F13B genes in two families affected by severe FXIII deficiency. Outcome confirmation analysis and variant studies in related patients was done by Sanger sequencing. Two variants were found: c.34A > G (p.Arg12Gly; NM_00129.3) and c.514C > T (p.Arg172Ter; NM_00129.3), both located in the F13A1 gene. The variant p.Arg172Ter is already described in literature and was found in homozygosis in one family and in compound heterozygosis in the other family. The variant p.Arg12Gly variant has not been described previously. This variant is located in the activation peptide of the FXIII A-subunit which is highly conserved among FXIII homologs. Given the high risk of dangerous bleeding and early manifestation in severe FXIII-deficient patients, a prompt genetic confirmation is imperative. In this sense, NGS technology allows a rapid and simultaneous analysis of all regions of all the genes involved in the pathology."
