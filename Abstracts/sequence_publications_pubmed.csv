Some of these proteins pre-dominantly interact through the minor groove and are often described as not having strong sequence preference. In contrast, lac-repressor binds to DNA with strong sequence specificity, also interacts with the minor groove of its operator by partially intercalating two Leucine side-chains between two CG base pairs, in addition to its interaction with the major groove base atoms. The role of this interaction in the operator recognition has not been fully elucidated. We have done extensive quantum chemical calculations, from molecular dynamics derived snapshots, using dispersion-corrected density functional theory to show that this unstacking is energetically slightly unfavorable. However, among all the base-amino acid pairs studied, the CG/CG-Leucine pair, the natural sequence, is among the most stable ones. The bending of the DNA resulting from this intercalation is important for aligning the major dimeric protein and the DNA interfaces. Thus, the sacrifice of modest binding energy enhances the sequence-specificity. Given many prokaryotic repressors belong to the lac repressor family, this could be a general mechanism for augmenting sequence specificity."

Among diverse dynamic systems, redox-responsive DNA assembly holds great promise for broad applications, especially considering that redox processes widely exist in various physiological environments. However, only a few studies have been reported on redox-sensitive dynamic DNA assembly. Albeit ingenious, most of these studies are either dependent on the DNA sequence or involve chemical modification. Herein, a facile and universal mechanism to realize redox-responsive self-assembly of DNA nanocages (tetrahedron and cube) driven by the interconversion between cystamine and cysteamine toward dynamic DNA nanotechnology is reported."

In the present work, an unusual sequence effect in the 5'-CTTCTG1G2TCCTCATTC-3' DNA duplex is reported for ABP- and AF-modified G. Specifically, the ABP modification at G1 resulted in a mixture of 67% major groove B-type (B) and 33% stacked (S) conformers, while at the ABP modification at G2 exclusively resulted in the B-conformer. The AF modification at G1 and G2 lead to 25%:75% and 83%:17% B:S population ratios, respectively. These differences in preferred conformation are due to an interplay between stabilizing (hydrogen bonding and stacking that is enhanced by lesion planarity) and destabilizing (solvent exposure) forces at the lesion site. Furthermore, while the B-conformer is a thermodynamic stabilizer and the S-conformer is a destabilizer in duplex settings, the situation is reversed at the single strands/double strands (ss/ds) junction. Specifically, the twisted biphenyl is a better stacker at the ss/ds junction than the coplanar AF. Therefore, the ABP modification leads to a stronger strand binding affinity of the ss/ds junction than the AF modification. Overall, the current work provides conformational insights into the role of sequence and lesion effects in modulating DNA replication."

In addition, several contradictory base pairs have been proposed as their binding sites on the 16S rRNA. This study investigated the binding of minocycline and doxycycline to short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) of random base sequences. These tetracyclines caused a dose-dependent decrease in the fluorescence intensities of 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labelled dsRNA and ethidium bromide (EtBr)-stained dsRNA, indicating that both drugs bind to dsRNA of random base sequence in a manner that is competitive with the binding of EtBr and other nucleic acid ligands often used as stains. This effect was observable in the presence of Mg(2+). The binding of the tetracyclines to dsRNA changed features of the fluorescence emission spectra of the drugs and the CD spectra of the RNA, and inhibited RNase III cleavage of the dsRNA. These results indicate that the double-stranded structures of RNAs may have a more important role in their interaction with the tetracyclines than the specific base pairs, which had hitherto been the subject of much investigation. Given the diverse functions of cellular RNAs, the binding of the tetracyclines to their double-stranded helixes may alter the normal processing and functioning of the various biological processes they regulate. This could help to explain the wide range of action of the tetracyclines against various pathogens and disease conditions."

An example is the pair of N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-AF) and N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (dG-C8-AAF) adducts that differ by a single acetyl group. The NER efficiencies in human HeLa cell extracts of these lesions are significantly different when placed at G(1), G(2) or G(3) in the duplex sequence (5'-CTCG(1)G(2)CG(3)CCATC-3') containing the NarI mutational hot spot. Furthermore, the dG-C8-AAF adduct is a better substrate of NER than dG-C8-AF in all three NarI sequence contexts. The conformations of each of these adducts were investigated by Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. In the base-displaced conformational family, the greater repair susceptibility of dG-C8-AAF in all sequences stems from steric hindrance effects of the acetyl group which significantly diminish the adduct-base stabilizing van der Waals stacking interactions relative to the dG-C8-AF case. Base sequence context effects for each adduct are caused by differences in helix untwisting and minor groove opening that are derived from the differences in stacking patterns. Overall, the greater NER efficiencies are correlated with greater extents of base sequence-dependent local untwisting and minor groove opening together with weaker stacking interactions."

Analysis of the 128 water samples for presence of the mip gene by nested-PCR revealed, 18 (23%) positive cases in Kerman and 7(14%) in Bam. However, when samples were tested by real-time PCR, we identified 4 more new cases of L. pneumophila in the hospitals as well as nursing homes water systems that were missed by nested-PCR. The highest rate of contamination was detected in water obtained from hospitals cooling towers in both the cities (p≤0.05). Dendrogram analysis and clonal relationship by PCR-base sequence typing (SBT) of the L. pneumophila genomic DNAs in Kerman water samples showed close clonal similarities among the isolates, in contrast, isolates identified from Bam city demonstrated two fingerprint patterns. The clones from hospital water samples were more related to the L. pneumophila serogroup- 1."

Here, we systematically analyzed the specificity of DNMT1, revealing a pronounced influence of the DNA sequences flanking the target CpG site on DNMT1 activity. We determined DNMT1 structures in complex with preferred DNA substrates revealing that DNMT1 employs flanking sequence-dependent base flipping mechanisms, with large structural rearrangements of the DNA correlating with low catalytic activity. Moreover, flanking sequences influence the conformational dynamics of the active site and cofactor binding pocket. Importantly, we show that the flanking sequence preferences of DNMT1 highly correlate with genomic methylation in human and mouse cells, and 5-azacytidine triggered DNA demethylation is more pronounced at CpG sites with flanks disfavored by DNMT1. Overall, our findings uncover the intricate interplay between CpG-flanking sequence, DNMT1-mediated base flipping and the dynamic landscape of DNA methylation."

In the present paper, we discuss the role played by the title nucleosides X and Y (where X and Y stand for A, C, G, or T) on the formation and stability of 2Q structures formed by the XGGYGGT oligodeoxynucleotides. We found that the above mentioned dimerization pathway is not peculiar to the CGGTGGT sequence, but is possible for all the remaining CGGYGGT sequences (with Y = A, C, or G). Furthermore, we have found that the TGGAGGT sequence, despite the absence of the 5'-ending C, is also capable of forming a 2Q-like higher order quadruplex by using a slightly different dimerization interface, as characterized by NMR spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a quadruplex multimer formed by an oligodeoxynucleotide presenting a thymine at its 5'-end. Examples of such structures were observed previously only in crystals and in the presence of non-physiological cations. Our results expand the repertoire of DNA quadruplex nanostructures of chosen length and add further complexity to the structural polymorphism of G-rich DNA sequences. "

While the SP presents excellent sensitivity for the target, it gives subtle discrimination between the perfect target sequence and several mismatch sequences. Its sequence-specificity for the target was greatly enhanced by using nucleic acid blockers (NABs), which are unlabeled, non-fluorescent hairpin oligonucleotides that are perfectly complementary to those mismatch sequences. This approach is simple, feasible at room temperature, requires no amplification enzymes, and it is suitable for applications requiring routine nucleic acids sequence detection and quantification methods such as genetic testing and biomedical diagnostics."

We examined this assumption by comparing direct-type end products produced in films of d(CTCTCGAGAG)(2) with those produced in films of d(GCACGCGTGC)(2). Here we report the product yields in d(CTCTCGAGAG)(2) hydrated to Γ = 2.5 and 15, where Γ is the hydration level given in moles of H(2)O/mole of nucleotide. Of the 17 products monitored by GC/MS, seven exhibited statistically significant yields: 8-oxoGua, 8-oxoAde, 5-OHMeUra, 5,6-diHUra, 5,6-diHThy, 5-OHCyt, and 5-OHUra. These yields at Γ = 2.5 are compared with the yields from our previously reported study of d(GCACGCGTGC)(2) (after projecting the yields to a CG/AT ratio of 1). The ratio of projected yields, d(CTCTCGAGAG)(2) divided by d(GCACGCGTGC)(2), are 1.3 ± 0.9, 1.8 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.6, 11.4 ± 4.7, 0.2 ± 0.1, >28, and 0.8 ± 1.1, respectively. Considering just d(CTCTCGAGAG)(2), the ratios of yields at Γ = 2.5 divided by yields at Γ = 15 are 0.7 ± 0.2, 0.5 ± 0.1, 2.3 ± 4.0, 3.4 ± 1.2, 3.5 ± 3.3, 1.2 ± 0.2, and 0.4 ± 0.2, respectively. The effects of sequence and hydration on base product yields are explained by a working model emphasizing the difference between two distinctly different types of reaction: (i) radical reactions that progress to nonradical intermediates and product prior to dissolution and (ii) reactions that stem from radicals trapped in the solid state at room temperature that go on to yield nonradical product after sample dissolution. Based on these findings, insights into rates of hole and excess electron-transfer relative to rates of proton transfer are discussed."

In the case of normal sequences, the primary position of Guanine oxidations by one-electron oxidants such as carbonate radical anions, BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene), and riboflavin are 5'-G in GG doublets and the central G in a GGG triplet. According to results, the properties of guanine oxidation on abasic site containing sequences are independent from the position of AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the presence of carbonate radical anions under a short irradiation time, although this radical is exposed to solvent by the existence of an abasic site. The lack of abasic site effect on guanine oxidative damage by the carbonate radical may be due to a sequence-independent property of the initial electron transfer rate in the hole injection step, or may relate to an electron transfer mechanism with large reorganization energy dependency. Consequently, the carbonate radical anions may easily migrate to another single G in the charge re-distribution step. Meanwhile, there is a strong dependency on the presence of an AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the cleavage patterns of guanine oxidations by physically large oxidizing agents, such as BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene) and riboflavin.

The PBD dimer SJG-136, which has a C8-O-(CH(2))(3)-O-C8'' central linker joining the two PBD moieties, is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials and current research is focused on developing analogues of SJG-136 with different linker lengths and substitution patterns. Using a reversed-phase ion pair HPLC/MS method to evaluate interaction with oligonucleotides of varying length and sequence, we recently reported (JACS, 2009, 131, 13 756) that SJG-136 can form three different types of adducts: inter- and intrastrand cross-linked adducts, and mono-alkylated adducts. These studies have now been extended to include PBD dimers with a longer central linker (C8-O-(CH(2))(5)-O-C8'), demonstrating that the type and distribution of adducts appear to depend on (i) the length of the C8/C8'-linker connecting the two PBD units, (ii) the positioning of the two reactive guanine bases on the same or opposite strands, and (iii) their separation (i.e. the number of base pairs, usually ATs, between them). Based on these data, a set of rules are emerging that can be used to predict the DNA-interaction behaviour of a PBD dimer of particular C8-C8' linker length towards a given DNA sequence.

It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the current analysis, we searched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the human genome. To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol. These analogs might be valuable in the treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections."

Using incremental mountain height, a representation of structural information computable in cubic time, RNAmountAlign implements quadratic time pairwise local, global and global/semiglobal (query search) alignment using a weighted combination of sequence and structural similarity. RNAmountAlign is capable of performing progressive multiple alignment as well. Benchmarking of RNAmountAlign against LocARNA, LARA, FOLDALIGN, DYNALIGN, STRAL, MXSCARNA, and MUSCLE shows that RNAmountAlign has reasonably good accuracy and faster run time supporting all alignment types. Additionally, our extension of RNAmountAlign, called RNAmountAlignScan, which scans a target genome sequence to find hits having high sequence and structural similarity to a given query sequence, outperforms RSEARCH and sequence-only query scans and runs faster than FOLDALIGN query scan."

Our results demonstrate that 20-30% DNA extension is sufficient for breaking B-DNA around and significantly above cellular supercoiling, and that the DNA sequence is crucial for understanding structural changes under mechanical stress. Our findings have important implications for the activities of protein machinery interacting with DNA in all cells."

These proteins include the oxidative DNA damage glycosylases 8-oxo-guanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and mutY homolog (MYH) as well as DNA polymerase beta (Polβ). While deletion of oxidative BER genes leads to decreased HIV infection and integration efficiency, the mechanism remains unknown. One hypothesis is that BER proteins repair the DNA gapped integration intermediate. An alternative hypothesis considers that the most common oxidative DNA base damages occur on guanines. The subtle consensus sequence preference at HIV integration sites includes multiple G:C base pairs surrounding the points of joining. These observations suggest a role for oxidative BER during integration targeting at the nucleotide level. We examined the hypothesis that BER repairs a gapped integration intermediate by measuring HIV infection efficiency in Polβ null cell lines complemented with active site point mutants of Polβ. A DNA synthesis defective mutant, but not a 5'dRP lyase mutant, rescued HIV infection efficiency to wild type levels; this suggested Polβ DNA synthesis activity is not necessary while 5'dRP lyase activity is required for efficient HIV infection. An alternate hypothesis that BER events in the host genome influence HIV integration site selection was examined by sequencing integration sites in OGG1 and MYH null cells. In the absence of these 8-oxo-guanine specific glycosylases the chromatin elements of HIV integration site selection remain the same as in wild type cells. However, the HIV integration site sequence preference at G:C base pairs is altered at several positions in OGG1 and MYH null cells. Inefficient HIV infection in the absence of oxidative BER proteins does not appear related to repair of the gapped integration intermediate; instead oxidative damage repair may participate in HIV integration site preference at the sequence level."

We constructed two duplexes containing the same minor groove-aligned 10S (+)-trans-anti-B[a]P-N(2)-dG (G*) DNA adduct, derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P): 5'-C-C-A-T-C-G*-C-T-A-C-C-3' (CG*C-I), and 5'-C-A-C3-A4-C5-G*-C-A-C-A-C-3' (CG*C-II). We used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to compare the extent of DNA bending, and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structural characteristics of these two DNA duplexes. The NER efficiencies are 1.6(+/-0.2)-fold greater in the case of the CG*C-II than the CG*C-I sequence context in 135-mer duplexes. Gel electrophoresis and self-ligation circularization experiments revealed that the CG*C-II duplex is more bent than the CG*C-I duplex, while molecular dynamics simulations showed that the unique -C3-A4-C5- segment in the CG*C-II duplex plays a key role. The presence of a minor groove-positioned guanine amino group, the Watson-Crick partner to C3, acts as a wedge; facilitated by a highly deformable local -C3-A4- base step, this amino group allows the B[a]P ring system to produce a more enlarged minor groove in CG*C-II than in CG*C-I, as well as a local untwisting and enlarged and flexible Roll only in the CG*C-II sequence. These structural properties fit well with our earlier findings that in the case of the family of minor groove 10S (+)-trans-anti-B[a]P-N(2)-dG lesions, flexible bends and enlarged minor groove widths constitute NER recognition signals, and extend our understanding of sequence context effects on NER to the neighbors that are distant to the lesion."

DNA oligonucleotides can, however, exhibit a great deal of local structural diversity. DNA conformation is strongly linked to both environmental conditions and the nucleobase identities inherent in the oligonucleotide sequence, but the exact relationship between sequence and local structure is not completely understood. This study examines how a single-nucleotide addition to a class of self-assembling DNA 13-mers leads to a significantly different overall structure under identical crystallization conditions. The DNA 13-mers self-assemble in the presence of Mg(2+) through a combination of Watson-Crick and noncanonical base-pairing interactions. The crystal structures described here show that all of the predicted Watson-Crick base pairs are present, with the major difference being a significant rearrangement of noncanonical base pairs. This includes the formation of a sheared A-G base pair, a junction of strands formed from base-triple interactions, and tertiary interactions that generate structural features similar to tandem sheared G-A base pairs. The adoption of this alternate noncanonical structure is dependent in part on the sequence in the Watson-Crick duplex region. These results provide important new insights into the sequence-structure relationship of short DNA oligonucleotides and demonstrate a unique interplay between Watson-Crick and noncanonical base pairs that is responsible for crystallization fate."

Although overall variation in open-reading frame (ORF) regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95), respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes.

The frequency of occurrence of individual nucleotides at the 50,000 most frequently cleaved sites was calculated and C nucleotides were found to be most prevalent at the cleavage site, followed by G and T, with A being the least prevalent. 5'-C*C and 5'-CC* dinucleotides (where * is the cleavage site) were found to be the present at the highest frequency at the cleavage site; while it was 5'-CC*C for trinucleotides and 5'-GCC*C and 5'-CC*CC for tetranucleotides. The frequency of occurrence of individual nucleotides at the most frequently cleaved sites was determined and the nucleotides in the sequence 5'-GGC*MH (where M is A or C, H is any nucleotide except G) were found to occur most frequently for DNA that was treated with endonuclease IV (to remove blocking 3'-phosphoglycolate termini); and 5'-GSC*MH (where S is G or C) for non-endonuclease IV-treated DNA.

The hierarchy depends on both the assumed range of energetic couplings, and the extent of sequence dependence of the model parameters. A significant feature of the models is that they exhibit the phenomenon of frustration: each base cannot simultaneously minimize the energy of all of its interactions. As a consequence, an arbitrary DNA oligomer has an intrinsic or pre-existing stress, with the level of this frustration dependent on the particular sequence of the oligomer. Attention is focussed on the particular model in the hierarchy that has nearest-neighbor interactions and dimer sequence dependence of the model parameters. For a Gaussian version of this model, a complete coarse-grain parameter set is estimated. The parameterized model allows, for an oligomer of arbitrary length and sequence, a simple and explicit construction of an approximation to the configuration-space equilibrium probability density function for the oligomer in solution. The training set leading to the coarse-grain parameter set is itself extracted from a recent and extensive database of a large number of independent, atomic-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of short DNA oligomers immersed in explicit solvent. The Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability density functions is used to make several quantitative assessments of our nearest-neighbor, dimer-dependent model, which is compared against others in the hierarchy to assess various assumptions pertaining both to the locality of the energetic couplings and to the level of sequence dependence of its parameters. It is also compared directly against all-atom MD simulation to assess its predictive capabilities. The results show that the nearest-neighbor, dimer-dependent model can successfully resolve sequence effects both within and between oligomers. For example, due to the presence of frustration, the model can successfully predict the nonlocal changes in the minimum energy configuration of an oligomer that are consequent upon a local change of sequence at the level of a single point mutation."

In this representation, the bio-chemical properties of the nucleotides are considered. The novelty of this method is that the sequences of unequal lengths are represented by vectors of the same length and each of the tri-nucleotide formed out of the given sequence has its unique representation. To validate the proposed method, it is verified on several data sets related to mammalians, viruses and bacteria. The results of this method are further compared with those obtained by methods such as probabilistic method, natural vector method, Fourier power spectrum method, multiple encoding vector method, and feature frequency profiles method.

All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide ""breakpoint sequences"", similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This ""breakpoint sequence hypothesis"" provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild."

First, we analyzed the effects of 10 MARs on transfected CHO cells and then analyzed the consensus motifs from these MARs using a bioinformatics method. The consensus sequence was synthesized and cloned upstream or downstream of the eukaryotic vector. The constructs were transfected into CHO cells and the expression levels and stability of enhanced green fluorescent protein were detected by flow cytometry. The results indicated that eight of the ten MARs increased transgene expression in transfected CHO cells. Three consensus motifs were found after bioinformatics analyses. The consensus sequence tandemly enhanced transgene expression when it was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector; the effect of the addition upstream was stronger than that downstream.

It is assumed that sequence recognition via direct base readout suffices for specificity and that spurious nonfunctional sites are rendered inaccessible by chromatin. We tested these assumptions through genome-wide mapping of GRFs in vivo and in purified biochemical systems at near-base pair (bp) resolution using several ChIP-exo-based assays. We find that computationally predicted DNA shape features (e.g., minor groove width, helix twist, base roll, and propeller twist) that are not defined by a unique consensus sequence are embedded in the nonunique portions of GRF motifs and contribute critically to sequence-specific binding. This dual source specificity occurs at GRF sites in promoter regions where chromatin organization starts. Outside of promoter regions, strong consensus sites lack the shape component and consequently lack an intrinsic ability to bind cognate GRFs, without regard to influences from chromatin. However, sites having a weak consensus and low intrinsic affinity do exist in these regions but are rendered inaccessible in a chromatin environment. Thus, GRF site-specificity is achieved through integration of favorable DNA sequence and shape readouts in promoter regions and by chromatin-based exclusion from fortuitous weak sites within gene bodies. This study further revealed a severe G/C nucleotide cross-linking selectivity inherent in all formaldehyde-based ChIP assays, which includes ChIP-seq. However, for most tested proteins, G/C selectivity did not appreciably affect binding site detection, although it does place limits on the quantitativeness of occupancy levels."

DsRNA must tightly bend to fit inside viral capsids or deform upon the interaction with proteins that regulate gene silencing or the immune response against viral attacks. However, the question of how the nucleotide sequence affects the global mechanical properties of dsRNA has so far remained largely unexplored. Here, we have employed state-of-the-art atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the mechanical response of different RNA duplexes to an external force. Our results reveal that, similarly to dsDNA, the mechanical properties of dsRNA are highly sequence-dependent. However, we find that the nucleotide sequence affects in a strikingly different manner the stretching and twisting response of RNA and DNA duplexes under force. We find that the elastic response of dsRNA is dominated by the local high flexibility of pyrimidine-purine steps. Moreover, the flexibility of pyrimidine-purine steps is independent of the sequence context, and the global flexibility of the duplex reasonably scales with the number of this kind of base-pair dinucleotides. We conclude that disparities of the mechanical response of dinucleotides are responsible for the differences observed in the mechanical properties of RNA and DNA duplexes."

The selective oxidation of guanine was initiated by photoexcitation of the aromatic sensitizers riboflavin and a pyrene derivative, and by the relatively small negatively charged carbonate radical anion. The relative rates of oxidation of the 5'- and 3' side G in runs of 5'⋅⋅⋅GG⋅⋅⋅ (evaluated by standard hot alkali treatment of the damaged DNA strand followed by high resolution gel electrophoresis of the cleavage fragments) are markedly affected by adjacent abasic sites either on the same or opposite strand. For example, in fully double-stranded DNA or one with an Ab adjacent to the 5'-G, the 5'-G/3'-G damage ratio is ≥4, but is inverted (<1.0) with the Ab adjacent to the 3'-G. These striking effects of Ab are attributed to the preferential localization of the ""hole"" on the most solvent-exposed guanine regardless of the size, charge, or reduction potential of the oxidizing species."

We determined three crystal structures of BZ junctions with diverse sequences followed by spectroscopic validation of DNA conformation. The structural features of the BZ junctions were well conserved regardless of sequences via the continuous base stacking through B-to-Z DNA with A-T base extrusion. However, the sequence-dependent structural heterogeneity of the junctions was also observed in base step parameters that are correlated with steric constraints imposed during Z-DNA formation. Further, circular dichroism and fluorescence-based analysis of BZ junctions revealed that a base extrusion was only found at the A-T base pair present next to a stable dinucleotide Z-DNA unit. Our findings suggest that Z-DNA formation in the genome is influenced by the sequence preference for BZ junctions."

Significant sequence effects on solvation and ion localization were observed in these simulations. The results were compared to essentially all known experimental data on the subject. Proximity analysis was employed to highlight the sequence dependent differences in solvation and ion localization properties in the grooves of DNA. Comparison of the MD-calculated DNA structure with canonical A- and B-forms supports the idea that the G/C-rich sequences are closer to canonical A- than B-form structures, while the reverse is true for the poly A sequences, with the exception of the alternating ATAT sequence. Analysis of hydration density maps reveals that the flexibility of solute molecule has a significant effect on the nature of observed hydration. Energetic analysis of solute-solvent interactions based on proximity analysis of solvent reveals that the GC or CG base pairs interact more strongly with water molecules in the minor groove of DNA that the AT or TA base pairs, while the interactions of the AT or TA pairs in the major groove are stronger than those of the GC or CG pairs. Computation of solvent-accessible surface area of the nucleotide units in the simulated trajectories reveals that the similarity with results derived from analysis of a database of crystallographic structures is excellent. The MD trajectories tend to follow Manning's counterion condensation theory, presenting a region of condensed counterions within a radius of about 17 A from the DNA surface independent of sequence. The GC and CG pairs tend to associate with cations in the major groove of the DNA structure to a greater extent than the AT and TA pairs. Cation association is more frequent in the minor groove of AT than the GC pairs. In general, the observed water and ion atmosphere around the DNA sequences is the MD simulation is in good agreement with experimental observations."

Here, we report that indirect effects of the helix sequence on RNA tertiary stability are, in fact, significant but are nevertheless predictable from a simple computational model called RNAMake-∆∆G. When tested through the RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) experimental platform, blind predictions for >1500 variants of the tectoRNA heterodimer model system achieve high accuracy (rmsd 0.34 and 0.77 kcal/mol for sequence and length changes, respectively). Detailed comparison of predictions to experiments support a microscopic picture of how helix sequence changes subtly modulate conformational fluctuations at each base-pair step, which accumulate to impact RNA tertiary structure stability. Our study reveals a previously overlooked phenomenon in RNA structure formation and provides a framework of computation and experiment for understanding helix conformational preferences and their impact across biological RNA and RNA-protein assemblies."

The supporting body of evidence is growing and it comes from multiple areas, including astrobiology, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and, in particular, from computer simulations. Such methods frequently assume the existence of a hypothetical species on Earth, around three billion years ago, with a base sequence probably dissimilar from any in known genomes. However, it is often hard to verify whether or not a hypothetical sequence has the characteristics of biological sequences, and is thus likely to be functional. The primary objective of the presented research was to verify the possibility of building a computational 'life probe' for determining whether a given genetic sequence is biological, and assessing the sensitivity of such probes to the signatures of life present in known biological sequences. We have proposed decision algorithms based on the normalized compression distance (NCD) and Levenshtein distance (LD). We have validated the proposed method in the context of the RNA World hypothesis using short genetic sequences shorter than the error threshold value (i.e., 100 nucleotides). We have demonstrated that both measures can be successfully used to construct life probes that are significantly better than a random decision procedure, while varying from each other when it comes to detailed characteristics. We also observed that fragments of sequences related to replication have better discriminatory power than sequences having other molecular functions. In a broader context, this shows that the signatures of life in short RNA samples can be effectively detected using relatively simple means."

In this article, we have studied the effect of base sequences in a series of oligonucleotide trimers by the analysis of damage remaining within the nonvolatile condensed phase after LEE irradiation. The model compounds include TXT, where X represents one of the four normal bases of DNA (thymine (T), cytosine (C), adenine (A), and guanine (G)). Using HPLC-UV analysis, several known fragments were quantified from the release of nonmodified nucleobases (T and X) as well as from phosphodiester C-O bond cleavage (pT, pXT, Tp, and TXp). The total damage was estimated by the disappearance of the parent peaks in the chromatogram of nonirradiated and irradiated samples. When trimers were irradiated with LEE (10 eV), the total damage decreased 2-fold in the following order: TTT > TCT > TAT > TGT. The release of nonmodified nuclobases (giving from 17 to 24% of the total products) mainly occurred from the terminal sites of trimers (i.e., T) whereas the release of central nucleobases was minor (C) or not at all detected (A and G). In comparison, the formation of products arising from phosphodiester bond cleavage accounted for 9 to 20% of the total damage and it partitioned to the four possible sites of cleavage present in trimers. This study indicates that the initial LEE capture and subsequent bond breaking within the intermediate anion depend on the sequence and electron affinity of the bases, with the most damage attributed to the most electronegative base, T."

Each of the heteroduplex fragments was treated with Ban I endonuclease and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Our results showed that heteroduplex fragments containing mismatched bases at either the first or third position of the Ban I recognition sequence or, because of the symmetrical structure of the sequence, the sixth or fourth position on the opposite strand were cleaved by the enzyme. Furthermore, these cleaved fragments contained at least one strand corresponding to the original Ban I recognition sequence. Fragments with mismatches formed by an A (noncanonical, nc) opposite a purine (canonical, ca) or a T (nc) opposite a pyrimidine (ca) were cleaved more efficiently than other types of mismatched bases.

A sequence graph represents a set of individual haploid reference genomes as paths in a single graph. When that set of reference genomes is sufficiently diverse, the sequence graph implicitly contains all frequent human genetic variations, including translocations, inversions, deletions, and insertions. In representing a set of genomes as a sequence graph, one encounters certain challenges. One of the most important is the problem of graph linearization, essential both for efficiency of storage and access, and for natural graph visualization and compatibility with other tools. The goal of graph linearization is to order nodes of the graph in such a way that operations such as access, traversal, and visualization are as efficient and effective as possible. A new algorithm for the linearization of sequence graphs, called the flow procedure (FP), is proposed in this article. Comparative experimental evaluation of the FP against other algorithms shows that it outperforms its rivals in the metrics most relevant to sequence graphs."

However, the advent of next-generation sequencing has rapidly facilitated an imbalance between accurate sequence data and accurate annotation data. To increase the annotation accuracy of the Caulobacter vibrioides CB13b1a (CB13) genome, we compared the PGAP and RAST annotations of the CB13 genome. A total of 64 unique genes were identified in the PGAP annotation that were either completely or partially absent in the RAST annotation, and a total of 16 genes were identified in the RAST annotation that were not included in the PGAP annotation. Moreover, PGAP identified 73 frameshifted genes and 22 genes with an internal stop. In contrast, RAST annotated the larger segment of these frameshifted genes without indicating a change in reading frame may have occurred. The RAST annotation did not include any genes with internal stop codons, since it chose start codons that were after the internal stop. To confirm the discrepancies between the two annotations and verify the accuracy of the CB13 genome sequence data, we re-sequenced and re-annotated the entire genome and obtained an identical sequence, except in a small number of homopolymer regions. A genome sequence comparison between the two versions allowed us to determine the correct number of bases in each homopolymer region, which eliminated frameshifts for 31 genes annotated as frameshifted genes and removed 24 pseudogenes from the PGAP annotation. Both annotation systems correctly identified genes that were missed by the other system. In addition, PGAP identified conserved gene fragments that represented the beginning of genes, but it employed no corrective method to adjust the reading frame of frameshifted genes or the start sites of genes harboring an internal stop codon. In doing so, the PGAP annotation identified a large number of pseudogenes, which may reflect evolutionary history but likely do not produce gene products. These results demonstrate that re-sequencing and annotation comparisons can be used to increase the accuracy of genomic data and the corresponding gene annotation."

Absorption of UV photons by DNA leads to dimerisation of pyrimidine bases and produces two major photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs). A previous study had determined that two hexanucleotide sequences, 5'-GCTC*AC and 5'-TATT*AA, were high intensity UV-induced DNA damage sites. The UV clone plasmid was constructed by systematically altering each nucleotide of these two hexanucleotide sequences. One of the main goals of this study was to determine the influence of single nucleotide alterations on the intensity of UV-induced DNA damage. The sequence 5'-GCTC*AC was designed to examine the sequence specificity of 6-4PPs and the highest intensity 6-4PP damage sites were found at 5'-GTTC*CC nucleotides. The sequence 5'-TATT*AA was devised to investigate the sequence specificity of CPDs and the highest intensity CPD damage sites were found at 5'-TTTT*CG nucleotides. It was proposed that the tetranucleotide DNA sequence, 5'-YTC*Y (where Y is T or C), was the consensus sequence for the highest intensity UV-induced 6-4PP adduct sites; while it was 5'-YTT*C for the highest intensity UV-induced CPD damage sites.

The unstacking transition of poly(dA) at high force reveals that the intrinsic electrostatic tension on the molecule varies significantly more weakly on salt concentration than mean-field predictions. Further, we provide a model-independent estimate of the free energy difference between stacked poly(dA) and unstacked polypyrimidine, finding it to be ∼-0.25 kBT/base and nearly constant over three orders of magnitude in salt concentration.

Based on this, it has been proposed that cognate mRNA/protein pairs may bind in a co-aligned manner, especially if unstructured. Here, we study the dependence of mRNA/protein sequence complementarity on the properties of the nucleobase/amino-acid affinity scales used. Specifically, we sample the space of randomly generated scales by employing a Monte Carlo strategy with a fitness function that depends directly on the level of complementarity. For model organisms representing all three domains of life, we show that even short searches reproducibly converge upon highly optimized scales, implying that the topology of the underlying fitness landscape is decidedly funnel-like. Furthermore, the optimized scales, generated without any consideration of the physicochemical attributes of nucleobases or amino acids, resemble closely the nucleobase/amino-acid binding affinity scales obtained from experimental structures of RNA-protein complexes. This provides support for the claim that mRNA/protein sequence complementarity may indeed be related to binding between the two. Finally, we characterize suboptimal scales and show that intermediate-to-high complementarity can be reached by substantially diverse scales, but with select amino acids contributing disproportionally. Our results expose the dependence of cognate mRNA/protein sequence complementarity on the properties of the underlying nucleobase/amino-acid affinity scales and provide quantitative constraints that any physical scales need to satisfy for the complementarity to hold."

Prior work with in vitro systems suggests that structural remodeling of RNA is difficult to achieve through the accumulation of point mutations or through recombination events. Sequence duplication may represent an alternative mechanism that can more readily lead to the evolution of new structures. Structural and sequence elements in many RNAs and proteins appear to be the products of duplication events, indicating that this mechanism plays a major role in molecular evolution. Despite the potential significance of this mechanism, little experimental data is available concerning the structural and evolutionary consequences of duplicating biopolymer sequences. To assess the structural consequences of sequence duplication on the evolution of RNA, we mutagenized an RNA sequence containing two copies of an ATP aptamer and subjected the resulting population to multiple in vitro evolution experiments. We identified multiple routes by which duplication, followed by the accumulation of functional point mutations, allowed our populations to sample two entirely different secondary structures. The two structures have no base pairs in common, but both structures contain two copies of the same ATP-binding motif. We do not observe the emergence of any other functional secondary structures beyond these two. Although this result suggests a limited capacity for duplication to support short-term functional innovation, major changes in secondary structure, like the one observed here, should be given careful consideration as they are likely to frustrate attempts to infer deep evolutionary histories of functional RNAs."

While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging. In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family. Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus species. We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA. These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies."

In this work, we have investigated the thermodynamic contributions of the loops on the stable formation of G-quadruplexes. Specifically, we use a combination of UV, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopies, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine thermodynamic profiles, including the differential binding of ions and water, for the unfolding of the thrombin aptamer: d(GGT2GGTGTGGT2GG) that is referred to as G2. The sequences in italics, TGT and T2, are known to form loops. Other sequences examined contained base substitutions in the TGT loop (TAT, TCT, TTT, TAPT, and UUU), in the T2 loops (T4, U2), or in both loops (UGU and U2, UUU and U2). The CD spectra of all molecules show a positive band centered at 292 nm, which corresponds to the ""chair"" conformation. The UV and DSC melting curves of each G-quadruplex show monophasic transitions with transition temperatures (T(M)s) that remained constant with increasing strand concentration, confirming their intramolecular formation. These G-quadruplexes unfold with T(M)s in the range from 43.2 to 56.5 degrees C and endothermic enthalpies from 22.9 to 37.2 kcal/mol. Subtracting the contribution of a G-quartet stack from each experimental profile indicated that the presence of the loops stabilize each G-quadruplex by favorable enthalpy contributions, larger differential binding of K+ ions (0.1-0.6 mol K+/ mol), and a variable uptake/release of water molecules (-6 to 8 mol H2O/mol). The thermodynamic contributions for these specific base substitutions are discussed in terms of loop stacking (base-base stacking within the loops) and their hydration effects."

In the present study the DRB5 genes from 18 subjects alleles were cloned and sequenced; haplotype analysis showed that 17 of them had a single copy of DRB5 and one consanguineous subject was homozygous at all HLA loci. Methodological approaches including robust and efficient long-range PCR amplification, molecular cloning, nucleotide sequencing and de novo sequence assembly were combined to characterize DRB5 alleles. DRB5 sequences covering from 5'UTR to the end of intron 5 were obtained for DRB5*01:01, 01:02 and 02:02; partial coverage including a segment spanning exon 2 to exon 6 was obtained for DRB5*01:03, 01:08N and 02:03. Phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences showed that the DRB5 alleles group together and have distinctive differences with other DRB loci. Novel intron variants of DRB5*01:01:01, 01:02 and 02:02 were identified. The newly characterized DRB5 intron variants of each DRB5 allele were found in subjects harboring distinct associations with alleles of DRB1, B and/or ethnicity. The new information provided by this study provides reference sequences for HLA typing methodologies. Extending sequence coverage may lead to identify the disease susceptibility factors of DRB5 containing haplotypes while the unexpected intron variations may shed light on understanding of the evolution of the DRB region."

Since B cell malignancies result from the clonal expansion of a single cell, IG genes represent a unique molecular signature common to all the malignant cells within an individual patient; thus, IG gene rearrangements can be used as clonal markers. In addition to serving as an important clonal identifier, the IG gene sequence can act as a 'molecular timeline' since it is associated with specific developmental stages and hence reflects the history of the B cell involved in the neoplastic transformation. Moreover, for certain malignancies, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the IG gene sequence holds prognostic and potentially predictive capabilities. That said, extrapolating meaningful conclusions from IG gene sequence analysis would be impossible if robust methods and tools were not available to aid in their analysis. This article, drawing on the vast experience of the European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC), details the technical aspects and essential requirements necessary to ensure reliable and reproducible IG gene sequence analysis in CLL, a test that is now recommended for all CLL patients prior to treatment. More specifically, the various analytical stages are described ranging from the identification of the clonotypic IG gene rearrangement and the determination of the nucleotide sequence to the accurate clinical interpretation of the IG gene sequence data."

The native enal-mediated cross-linking occurs in the 5'-CpG-3' sequence context but not in the 5'-GpC-3' sequence context. The ability of the native enal-derived 1,N(2)-dG adducts to induce interstrand DNA cross-links in the 5'-CpG-3' sequence as opposed to the 5'-GpC-3' sequence is attributed to the destabilization of the DNA duplex in the latter sequence context. Here, we report higher accuracy solution structures of the synthetically derived trimethylene cross-links, which are refined from NMR data with the AMBER force field. When the synthetic trimethylene cross-links are placed into either the 5'-CpG-3' or the 5'-GpC-3' sequence contexts, the DNA duplex maintains B-DNA geometry with structural perturbations confined to the cross-linked base pairs. Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding is conserved throughout the duplexes. Although different from canonical B-DNA stacking, the cross-linked and the neighbor base pairs stack in the 5'-CpG-3' sequence. In contrast, the stacking at the cross-linked base pairs in the 5'-GpC-3' sequence is greatly perturbed. The pi-stacking interactions between the cross-linked and the neighbor base pairs are reduced. This is consistent with remarkable chemical shift perturbations of the C(5) H5 and H6 nucleobase protons that shifted downfield by 0.4-0.5 ppm. In contrast, these chemical shift perturbations in the 5'-CpG-3' sequence are not remarkable, consistent with the stacked structure. The differential stacking of the base pairs at the cross-linking region probably explains the difference in stabilities of the trimethylene cross-links in the 5'-CpG-3' and 5'-GpC-3' sequence contexts and might, in turn, account for the sequence selectivity of the interstrand cross-link formation induced by the native enal-derived 1,N(2)-dG adducts."

UV light induces two major damage adducts: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs). Employing capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence and taking advantages of the distinct properties of the CPDs and 6-4PPs, we studied the sequence specificity of UV-induced DNA damage in a purified DNA sequence using two approaches: end-labelling and a polymerase stop/linear amplification assay. A mitochondrial DNA sequence that contained a random nucleotide composition was employed as the target DNA sequence. With previous methodology, the UV sequence specificity was determined at a dinucleotide or trinucleotide level; however, in this paper, we have extended the UV sequence specificity to a hexanucleotide level. With the end-labelling technique (for 6-4PPs), the consensus sequence was found to be 5'-GCTC*AC (where C* is the breakage site); while with the linear amplification procedure, it was 5'-TCTT*AC. With end-labelling, the dinucleotide frequency of occurrence was highest for 5'-TC*, 5'-TT* and 5'-CC*; whereas it was 5'-TT* for linear amplification. The influence of neighbouring nucleotides on the degree of UV-induced DNA damage was also examined.

These regions also have the potential to fold into G-quadruplexes (G4). The human RAD17 promoter sequence has such a region in the template strand of the gene. In this work, the potential G-quadruplex sequence (PQS) of the RAD17 gene promoter was analyzed in different sequence contexts. With two extra nucleotides of the native sequence on either side of the G4, the structure was found to fold into a hybrid-like G4, similar to the hybrid-1 fold that the human telomere sequence can adopt. With only one nucleotide on either side of the PQS, the topology of the structure was observed to be mixed, and without extra nucleotides on the ends, the sequence adopted a parallel fold. Next, the sequence was studied with synthetic incorporation of the oxidative modification OG into specific sites and installed into the promoter of plasmids with a luciferase gene. These plasmids were transfected into a human cell line to observe the effect of the G4s on transcription. The RAD17 PQS was found to decrease luciferase expression with the presence of OG that is consistent with RAD17 expression under oxidative stress. This serves as an example of how oxidative modification could affect transcription in the context of a G4."

Base pair opening is the first step of base flipping and the exact mechanism is still not well understood. We investigate sequence effects on base pair opening using extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations targeting the opening of 11 different canonical base pairs in two DNA sequences. Two popular biomolecular force fields are applied. To enhance sampling and calculate free energies, we bias the simulation along a simple distance coordinate using a newly developed adaptive sampling algorithm. The simulation is guided back and forth along the coordinate, allowing for multiple opening pathways. We compare the calculated free energies with those from an NMR study and check assumptions of the model used for interpreting the NMR data. Our results further show that the neighboring sequence is an important factor for the opening free energy, but also indicates that other sequence effects may play a role. All base pairs are observed to have a propensity for opening toward the major groove. The preferred opening base is cytosine for GC base pairs, while for AT there is sequence dependent competition between the two bases. For AT opening, we identify two non-canonical base pair interactions contributing to a local minimum in the free energy profile. For both AT and CG we observe long-lived interactions with water and with sodium ions at specific sites on the open base pair."

This property is used by inhibitors, such as camptothecin, that stabilize, by inhibiting the religation step, the cleavage complex, in which the enzyme is covalently attached to the 3'-phosphate of the cleaved DNA strand. These drugs are used in clinics as antitumor agents. Because three-dimensional structural studies have shown that camptothecin derivatives act as base pair mimics and intercalate between two base pairs in the ternary DNA-topoisomerase-inhibitor complex, we hypothesized that base pairs mimics could act like campthotecin and inhibit the religation reaction after the formation of the topoisomerase I-DNA cleavage complex. We show here that three base pair mimics, nucleobases analogues of the aminophenyl-thiazole family, once targeted specifically to a DNA sequence were potent topoisomerase IB inhibitors. The targeting was achieved through covalent linkage to a sequence-specific DNA ligand, a triplex-forming oligonucleotide, and was necessary to position and keep the nucleobase analogue in the cleavage complex. In the absence of triplex formation, only a weak binding to the DNA and topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage was observed. The three compounds were equally active once conjugated, implying that the intercalation of the nucleobase upon triplex formation is the essential feature for the inhibition activity."

Recently we developed a computational method called REPdenovo that constructs consensus repeat sequences directly from short sequence reads, which outperforms an existing tool called RepARK. One major issue with REPdenovo is that it doesn't perform well for repeats with relatively high divergence rates or low copy numbers. In this paper, we present an improved approach for constructing consensus repeats directly from short reads.

In vitro studies here show that at the same shift motif HIV reverse transcriptase generates -1 and +1 indels with their ratio being sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs specified by the RNA template slippage-prone sequence and its 5' adjacent base. The GGG sequence 3' adjacent to the U6A shift/slippage site, which is important for ribosomal frameshifting, is shown here to limit reverse transcriptase base substitution and indel 'errors' in the run of A's in the product. The indels characterized here have either 1 more or less A, than the corresponding number of template U's. cDNA with 5 A's may yield novel Gag product(s), while cDNA with an extra base, 7 A's, may only be a minor contributor to GagPol polyprotein. Synthesis of a proportion of non-ribosomal frameshift derived GagPol would be relevant in efforts to identify therapeutically useful compounds that perturb the ratio of GagPol to Gag, and pertinent to the extent in which specific polymerase slippage is utilized in gene expression."

The G+* in ODN, produced by oxidation with SO4-*, deprotonates to form the neutral G radical (G(-H)*). In experiments using 5-substituted cytosine-modified ODN, substitution of the cytosine C5 hydrogen by a methyl group increased the rate constant of deprotonation, whereas replacement by bromine decreased the rate constant. Kinetic solvent isotope effects on the kinetics of deoxyguanosine (dG) and ODN duplexes were examined in H2O and D2O. The rate constant of formation of G(-H)* in dG was 1.7-fold larger in H2O than D2O, whereas the rate constant in the ODN duplex was 3.8-fold larger in H2O than D2O. These results suggest that the formation of G(-H)* from G+* in the ODN corresponds to the deprotonation of the oxidized hydrogen-bridged (G+*-C) base pair by a water molecule. The characteristic absorption maxima of G+* around 400 nm were shifted to a longer wavelength in the order of G<GG<GGG-containing ODNs. In contrast, the spectra of G(-H)* were not affected by the sequence and were essentially similar to that of free dG. These results suggest that the positive charge in G+* in ODN is delocalized over the extended pi orbitals of DNA base. The rate constant of the deprotonation was altered by the sequence of ODNs, where bases adjacent to guanine are important factors for deprotonation."

However, recent reports suggest that additional base pair interactions occur between HCV RNA and miR-122. We searched 606 sequences from a public database (genotypes 1 to 6) and identified two conserved, putatively single-stranded RNA segments, upstream of S1 (nt 2 and 3) and S2 (nt 30 to 34), with potential for base pairing to miR-122 (nt 15 and 16 and nt 13 to 16, respectively). Mutagenesis and genetic complementation experiments confirmed that HCV nt 2 and 3 pair with nt 15 and 16 of miR-122 bound to S1, while HCV nt 30 to 33 pair with nt 13 to 16 of miR-122 at S2. In genotype 1 and 6 HCV, nt 4 also base pairs with nt 14 of miR-122. These 3' supplementary base pair interactions of miR-122 are functionally important and are required for Ago2 recruitment to HCV RNA by miR-122, miR-122-mediated stabilization of HCV RNA, and production of infectious virus. However, while complementary mutations at HCV nt 30 and 31 efficiently rescued the activity of a 15C,16C miR-122 mutant targeting S2, similar mutations at nt 2 and 3 failed to rescue Ago2 recruitment at S1. These data add to the current understanding of miR-122 interactions with HCV RNA but indicate that base pairing between miR-122 and the 5' 43 nt of the HCV genome is more complex than suggested by existing models."

The protein contains a C-terminal DNA binding domain with four tandem zinc-fingers (ZF1-4). An alternative splicing of Wt1 can add three additional amino acids-lysine (K), threonine (T) and serine (S)-between ZF3 and ZF4. In the -KTS isoform, ZF2-4 determine the sequence-specificity of DNA binding, whereas the function of ZF1 remains elusive. Three X-ray structures are described here for wild-type -KTS isoform ZF1-4 in complex with its cognate DNA sequence. We observed four unique ZF1 conformations. First, like ZF2-4, ZF1 can be positioned continuously in the DNA major groove forming a 'near-cognate' complex. Second, while ZF2-4 make base-specific interactions with one DNA molecule, ZF1 can interact with a second DNA molecule (or, presumably, two regions of the same DNA molecule). Third, ZF1 can intercalate at the joint of two tail-to-head DNA molecules. If such intercalation occurs on a continuous DNA molecule, it would kink the DNA at the ZF1 binding site. Fourth, two ZF1 units can dimerize. Furthermore, we examined a Denys-Drash syndrome-associated ZF1 mutation (methionine at position 342 is replaced by arginine). This mutation enhances WT1 affinity for a guanine base. X-ray crystallography of the mutant in complex with its preferred sequence revealed the interactions responsible for this affinity change. These results provide insight into the mechanisms of action of WT1, and clarify the fact that ZF1 plays a role in determining sequence specificity of this critical transcription factor."

Benzo[a]pyrene,diol epoxide (BPDE) is a potent cigarette smoke carcinogen that forms guanine adducts at TP53 CpG mutation hotspot sites including codons 157, 158, 245, 248 and 273. We performed molecular modelling of BPDE-adducted TP53 duplex sequences to determine the degree of local distortion caused by adducts which could influence the ability of nucleotide excision repair. We show that BPDE adducted codon 157 has greater structural distortion than other TP53 G:C>T:A hotspot sites and that sequence context more distal to adjacent bases must influence local distortion. Using TP53 trinucleotide mutation signatures for lung cancer in smokers and non-smokers we further show that codons 157 and 273 have the highest mutation probability in smokers. Combining this information with adduct structural data we predict that G:C>T:A mutations at codon 157 in lung tumours of smokers are predominantly caused by BPDE. Our results provide insight into how different DNA sequence contexts show variability in DNA distortion at mutagen adduct sites that could compromise DNA repair at well characterized cancer related mutation hotspots.

Based on this DNA sequence, we constructed a plasmid clone to explore this bleomycin cleavage preference. By systematic variation of single nucleotides in the 5'-RTGT*AY sequence, we were able to investigate the effect of nucleotide changes on bleomycin cleavage efficiency. We observed that the preferred consensus DNA sequence for bleomycin cleavage in the plasmid clone was 5'-YYGT*AW (where W is A/T). The most highly cleaved sequence was 5'-TCGT*AT and, in fact, the seven most highly cleaved sequences conformed to the consensus sequence 5'-YYGT*AW. A comparison with genome-wide results was also performed and while the core sequence was similar in both environments, the surrounding nucleotides were different."

However, GWs suffer high attenuation when they propagate in long bones, resulting in a low SNR. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a base-sequence-modulated Golay code (BSGC) to produce larger amplitude and improve the SNR in the ultrasound evaluation of long bones. A 16-bit Golay code was used for excitation in computer simulation. The decoded GWs and the traditional GWs, which were generated by a single pulse, agreed well after decoding the received signals, and the SNR was improved by 26.12 dB. In the experiments using bovine bones, the BSGC excitation produced the amplitudes which were at least 237 times greater than those produced by a single pulse excitation. The BSGC excitation also allowed the GWs to be received over a longer distance between two transducers. The results suggest the BSGC excitation has the potential to measure GWs and assess long bones."

For instance, dicationic diamindines, a well-known class of minor groove binding compounds, have been shown to inhibit interactions of transcription factors binding to genomic DNA. The applications of these compounds could be significantly expanded if we understand sequence-specific recognition of DNA better and could use the information to design more sequence-specific compounds. Aside from polyamides, minor groove binders typically recognize DNA at A-tract or alternating AT base pair sites. Targeting sites with GC base pairs, referred to here as mixed base pair sequences, is much more difficult than those rich in AT base pairs. Compound 1 is the first dicationic diamidine reported to recognize a mixed base pair site. It binds in the minor groove of ATGA sequences as a dimer with positive cooperativity. Due to the well-characterized behavior of 1 with ATGA and AT rich sequences, it provides a paradigm for understanding the elements that are key for recognition of mixed sequence sites. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is a powerful method to screen DNA complexes formed by analogues of 1 for specific recognition. We also report a novel approach to determine patterns of recognition by 1 for cognate ATGA and ATGA-mutant sequences. We found that functional group modifications and mutating the DNA target site significantly affect binding and stacking, respectively. Both compound conformation and DNA sequence directionality are crucial for recognition. "

During host colonization, many fungal pathogens secrete effectors to perturb such responses, but these in turn may become recognized by host immune receptors. To facilitate the evolution of effector repertoires, such as the elimination of recognized effectors, effector genes often reside in genomic regions that display increased plasticity, a phenomenon that is captured in the two-speed genome hypothesis. The genome of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae displays regions with extensive presence/absence polymorphisms, so-called lineage-specific regions, that are enriched in in planta-induced putative effector genes. As expected, comparative genomics reveals differential degrees of sequence divergence between lineage-specific regions and the core genome. Unanticipated, lineage-specific regions display markedly higher sequence conservation in coding as well as noncoding regions than the core genome. We provide evidence that disqualifies horizontal transfer to explain the observed sequence conservation and conclude that sequence divergence occurs at a slower pace in lineage-specific regions of the V. dahliae genome. We hypothesize that differences in chromatin organisation may explain lower nucleotide substitution rates in the plastic, lineage-specific regions of V. dahliae."

Here, we present a patient with glomerular nephritis and hyperchloremia who underwent kidney transplant. Progressively increasing bicarbonate reabsorption by the renal graft, which thereby changed the arterial carbon dioxide tension-to-bicarbonate ratio, resulted in a time-sequence swing of an acid-base interpretation despite persistent mixed respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation syndrome and nongap metabolic acidosis due to preexisting hyperchloremia. Specifically, the sequence was mixed primary metabolic acidosis and primary respiratory acidosis immediately after surgery, primary metabolic acidosis and secondary respiratory alkalosis on postoperative days 1 and 2, mixed primary hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and primary respiratory alkalosis on postoperative day 3, and finally primary respiratory alkalosis and secondary hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis on postoperative day 7. This swing in the acid-base interpretation indicates that the acid-base imbalance described here does not fit the empirical relationship for calculating the expected bicarbonate or carbon dioxide tension value, suggesting that ""correct"" interpretation of acid-base status may not lead to ""correct"" diagnosis of acid-base status.

However, the relevant knowledge so far mainly comes from studies on isolated base pair radical anions, and their behavior in the DNA environment is less understood. In this study, we focus on how the nucleobase sequence affects the properties of the guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair radical anion. The energetic barrier and reaction energy for the proton transfer along the N(1)(G)-H···N(3)(C) hydrogen bond and the stability of GC˙(-) (i.e., electron affinity of GC) embedded in different sequences of base-pair trimer were evaluated using density functional theory. The computational results demonstrated that the presence of neighboring base pairs has an important influence on the behavior of GC˙(-) in the gas phase. The excess electron was found to be localized on the embedded GC and the charge leakage to neighboring base pairs was very minor in all of the investigated sequences. Accordingly, the sequence behavior of the proton-transfer reaction and the stability of GC˙(-) is chiefly governed by electrostatic interactions with adjacent base pairs. However, the effect of base stacking, due to its electrostatic nature, is severely screened upon hydration, and thus, the sequence dependence of the properties of GC˙(-) in aqueous environment becomes relatively weak and less than that observed in the gas phase. The effect of geometry relaxation associated with neighboring base pairs as well as the possibility of proton transfer along the N(2)(G)-H···O(2)(C) channel have also been investigated. The implications of the present findings to the electron transport and radiation damage of DNA are discussed."

The visualization of anchor-points alongside other DNA features, such as transcription factor binding sites, allows users to precisely examine whether a binding site of interest is conserved, even if the surrounding region exhibits poor sequence identity. This approach also aids in identifying orthologous segments of regulatory DNA, facilitating studies of regulatory sequence evolution.

Then a specially designed assistant probe with both terminals complementary to the target DNA and a G-quadruplex-forming sequence in the center was introduced into the detection solution. In the presence of both the target DNA and the assistant probe, the target DNA can be captured on the electrode surface and then a continuous HCR can be conducted due to the mutual recognition of the target DNA and the assistant probe, leading to the formation of a large number of G-quadruplex on the electrode surface. With the help of hemin, a pronounced electrochemical signal can be observed in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), due to the formation of G-quadruplex-hemin complex. The peak current is linearly related with the logarithm of the concentration of the target DNA in the range from 10 fM to 10 pM. The electrochemical sensor has high selectivity to clearly discriminate single-base mismatched and three-base mismatched sequences from the original HIV DNA sequence.

Its binding to deoxyhexanucleotides sequence d-(ATCGAT)2 has been studied by proton and phosphorous-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The stoichiometry reveals that 1:1 and 2:1 mitoxantrone-d(ATCGAT)2 complexes are formed in solution. Significant upfield shifts in 6H/7H, 2H/3H, 11NH, and 12NH protons (∼.5 ppm) of mitoxantrone and T6NH imino protons (∼.3 ppm) are observed. The phosphorous resonances do not shift significantly indicating that the base pairs do not open at any nucleotide step along the sequence of hexamer. Several inter-molecular Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement connectivities between mitoxantrone and hexanucleotide protons indicate that mitoxantrone chromophore stacks with terminal A1-T6 base pair and side chains involving 12CH2, 12NH, and 14OH protons are in close proximity of A1, T2, A5, and T6 bases. Absorption and emission spectra show red shift in wavelength maxima, which is characteristic of stacking interaction. At higher mitoxantrone to nucleic acid ratios, electrostatic interactions are dominant. The 2:1 drug/DNA stoichiometric structure obtained by restrained Molecular Dynamics simulations shows considerable distortions in backbone torsional angles and helicoidal parameters although structural fluctuations in 25 ps analysis of trajectory are found to be negligible. Mitoxantrone binds as a monomer at either or both ends of hexamer externally with side chains interacting specifically with DNA. The findings are relevant to the understanding of pharmacological action of drug. "

The associated sequence pattern, a 3-nt bulge and G-A, A-G base-pairs, generates an angle of ∼50° along the helical axis due to A-minor interactions. The conserved sequence and distinct secondary structures of kink-turns (k-turn) suggest computational folding rules to predict k-turn-like topologies from sequence. Here, we annotate observed k-turn motifs within a non-redundant RNA dataset based on sequence signatures and geometrical features, analyze bending and torsion angles, and determine distinct knowledge-based potentials with and without k-turn motifs. We apply these scoring potentials to our RAGTOP (RNA-As-Graph-Topologies) graph sampling protocol to construct and sample coarse-grained graph representations of RNAs from a given secondary structure. We present graph-sampling results for 35 RNAs, including 12 k-turn and 23 non k-turn internal loops, and compare the results to solved structures and to RAGTOP results without special k-turn potentials. Significant improvements are observed with the updated scoring potentials compared to the k-turn-free potentials. Because k-turns represent a classic example of sequence/structure motif, our study suggests that other such motifs with sequence signatures and unique geometrical features can similarly be utilized for RNA structure prediction and design."

The gene with deletions and substitutions in the 5'-flanking sequence was used to transfect HeLa cells and its transcriptional activity was evaluated from the cellular level of 4.5SI RNA. Single-nucleotide substitutions in the region adjacent to the transcription start site (positions -2 to -8) decreased the expression activity of the gene down to 40%-60% of the control. The substitution of the conserved pentanucleotide AGAAT (positions -14 to -18) could either decrease (43%-56%) or increase (134%) the gene expression. A TATA-like box (TACATGA) was found at positions -24 to -30 of the 4.5SI RNA gene. Its replacement with a polylinker fragment of the vector did not decrease the transcription level, while its replacement with a GC-rich sequence almost completely (down to 2%-5%) suppressed the transcription of the 4.5SI RNA gene. The effect of plasmid sequences bordering the gene on its transcription by RNA polymerase III is discussed."

Although many studies have investigated expression differences of genes putatively governing resistance to producing fungi, few have confirmed a resistance role, or examined putative resistance gene structure in more than a couple of inbreds. The pericarp expression of maize Px5 has previously been associated with resistance to Aspergillus flavus growth and insects in a set of inbreds. Genes from 14 different inbreds that included ones with resistance and susceptibility to A. flavus, Fusarium proliferatum, F. verticillioides and F. graminearum and/or mycotoxin production were cloned using high fidelity enzymes, and sequenced. The sequence of Px5 from all resistant inbreds was identical, except for a single base change in two inbreds, only one of which affected the amino acid sequence. Conversely, the Px5 sequence from several susceptible inbreds had several base variations, some of which affected amino acid sequence that would potentially alter secondary structure, and thus enzyme function. The sequence of the maize peroxidase Px5 common to inbreds resistant to mycotoxigenic fungi was overexpressed in maize callus. Callus transformants overexpressing the gene caused significant reductions in growth for fall armyworms, corn earworms, and F. graminearum compared to transformant callus with a β-glucuronidase gene. This study demonstrates rarer transcripts of potential resistance genes overlooked by expression screens can be identified by sequence comparisons. A role in pest resistance can be verified by callus expression of the candidate genes, which can thereby justify larger scale transformation and regeneration of transgenic plants expressing the resistance gene for further evaluation.

Such cell type-specific binding specificity is expected to result from interplay between the TF's intrinsic sequence preferences, cooperative interactions with other regulatory proteins, and cell type-specific chromatin landscapes. Cell type-specific TF binding events are highly correlated with patterns of chromatin accessibility and active histone modifications in the same cell type. However, since concurrent chromatin may itself be a consequence of TF binding, chromatin landscapes measured prior to TF activation provide more useful insights into how cell type-specific TF binding events became established in the first place. Here, we review the various sequence and chromatin determinants of cell type-specific TF binding specificity. We identify the current challenges and opportunities associated with computational approaches to characterizing, imputing, and predicting cell type-specific TF binding patterns. We further focus on studies that characterize TF binding in dynamic regulatory settings, and we discuss how these studies are leading to a more complex and nuanced understanding of dynamic protein-DNA binding activities. We propose that TF binding activities at individual sites can be viewed along a two-dimensional continuum of local sequence and chromatin context. Under this view, cell type-specific TF binding activities may result from either strongly favorable sequence features or strongly favorable chromatin context."

The correspondence between regions of the nucleotide and protein sequence spaces is understood in general but not in detail. One of the unexplored questions is how many sequences a protein can reach with a certain number of nucleotide substitutions in its gene sequence. Here I propose an algorithm to calculate the volume of protein sequence space accessible to a given protein sequence as a function of the number of nucleotide substitutions made in the protein-coding sequence. The algorithm utilizes the power of the dynamic programming approach, and makes all calculations within a couple of seconds on a desktop computer. I apply the algorithm to green fluorescence protein, and get the number of sequences four times higher than estimated before. However, taking into account the astronomically huge size of the protein sequence space, the previous estimate can be considered as acceptable as an order of magnitude estimation. The proposed algorithm has practical applications in the study of evolutionary trajectories in sequence space."

To explore the folding landscapes of tRNA, we performed ion concentration-dependent coarse-grained TIS model MD simulations of several E. coli tRNAs to compare their thermodynamic melting profiles to the classical absorbance spectra of Crothers and co-workers. To independently validate our findings, we also performed atomistic empirical force field MD simulations of tRNAs, and we compared the base-to-base distances from coarse-grained and atomistic MD simulations to empirical base-stacking free energies. We then projected the free energies to the secondary structural elements of tRNA, and we observe distinct, parallel folding mechanisms whose differences can be inferred on the basis of their sequence-dependent base-stacking stabilities. In some cases, a premature, nonproductive folding intermediate corresponding to the Ψ hairpin loop must backtrack to the unfolded state before proceeding to the folded state. This observation suggests a possible explanation for the fast and slow phases observed in tRNA folding kinetics. "

However, there is a need for better markers to resolve the problems that have limited their usefulness. In this report, we introduce the protein tag (Ptag) sequence, a highly polymorphic amino acid sequence within the C-terminal region of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, as a new systematic tag sequence for delineating the evolutionary history of medically important fungi. As Ptag sequences are highly polymorphic between species and low within species, 42 fungal species representing the main taxonomic groups in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were tested. The phylogenetic tree inferred from the Ptag sequences showed high consistency with the accepted classification of the Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life (AFTOL) project. Moreover, it could resolve the interspecies phylogenetic relationships of the tested taxa. In contrast, the phylogeny inferred from the nucleotide tag (Ntag) sequence, encoding the Ptag peptide, displayed lesser discriminatory power in resolving the phylogenetic relationships among distantly related taxa. In the case of closely related fungal species, the phylogenetic trees for Ptag and Ntag sequences were consistent with the tree for ITS1 sequences of 11 dermatophytic species. Taken together, the Ptag sequences should contribute to inferring phylogeny among species whereas the Ntag sequences should be useful to analyze variations among closely related species to resolve taxonomic issues in fungi."

We found that DNA minicircle topoisomers can have multiple bend locations under high torsional stress and that the positions of these sharp bends are determined by the sequence, and by a positive mechanical correlation along the sequence. We showed that simulations and theory are able to provide sequence-specific information about individual DNA minicircles observed by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). We provided a sequence-specific cryo-ET tomogram fitting of DNA minicircles, registering the sequence within the geometric features.

The most critical types of radiation-induced DNA damage are DNA double-strand breaks, and these breaks are repaired by either the homologous recombination (HR) pathway or the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. The HR pathway is not as mutagenic as the NHEJ pathway, and it is expected that radiation-induced deletions would usually have little sequence similarity around the deletion junction points. Here we report sequence data from the regions around the rejoined junctions of 33 de novo copy-number mutations (27 deletions and 6 duplications) obtained from offspring sired by male mice that were irradiated at the spermatogonia stage and from nonirradiated controls. The results indicate that deletions can be classified into three major groups. In group 1, nine deletions were found to share long blocks of similar sequences (200-6,000 bp) at the junctions and the deletion size varied extensively (1 kb to 2 Mb) (e.g., illegitimate recombination). In group 2, five deletions shared short identical sequences (0-7 bp) at the junctions, and the deletion sizes were shorter than 200 kb (e.g., micro-homology-mediated repair). Additional three-deletion candidates of this group were also found but turned out to be inherited from mosaic parents. They are therefore not included in germline mutations. In group 3, twelve deletions shared little sequence similarity (only 0-2 bp) at the junctions (likely due to NHEJ repair) and deletion sizes were longer than 200 kb. Group 1 consisted of deletions found in both spontaneous and irradiated genomes and thus, were probably caused by spontaneous events during meiosis or DNA replication. Group 2 consisted mainly of deletions found in nonexposed genomes. Group 3 consisted primarily of deletions that occurred in the irradiated genomes. Among the duplications, we found no indication of any association with radiation exposures.

The local sequence-dependent features of DNA found in high-resolution structures introduce irregularities in the disposition of adjacent residues that facilitate the specific binding of proteins and modulate the global folding and interactions of double helices with hundreds of basepairs. These features also determine the positions of nucleosomes on DNA and the lengths of the interspersed DNA linkers. Like the patterns of basepair association within DNA, the arrangements of nucleosomes in chromatin modulate the properties of longer polymers. The intrachromosomal loops detected in genomic studies contain hundreds of nucleosomes, and given that the simulated configurations of chromatin depend on the lengths of linker DNA, the formation of these loops may reflect sequence-dependent information encoded within the positioning of the nucleosomes. With knowledge of the positions of nucleosomes on a given genome, methods are now at hand to estimate the looping propensities of chromatin in terms of the spacing of nucleosomes and to make a direct connection between the DNA base sequence and larger-scale chromatin folding."

Of CpG sites that fell within CpG islands, 11% and 1% contained significant 5mC and 5hmC, respectively. 5mC levels were substantially higher for genes with lower mRNA abundance and showed a prominent nadir around the transcription start site. In contrast, 5hmC levels were higher in genes with higher expression.

Objetivo. Evaluar la relación genética entre aislamientos de Salmonella Enteritidis de aves de corral y humanos con gastroenteritis mediante multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

Materiales y métodos. Se aisló Salmonella spp., de casos clínicos de gastroenteritis (n=110). Se realizó test de sensibilidad antibiótica, seguido de serotipificación y tipificación por medio de MLST y se comparó S. Enteritidis de humanos frente a S. Enteritidis de granjas ponedoras y de huevo comercializado (n=6).

Resultados. Se aislaron 10 cepas de Salmonella spp., a partir de heces de humanos con gastroenteritis. Se obtuvo una prevalencia de Salmonella spp. de 9.09%, siendo S. Enteritidis (n=4), S. Typhymurium (n=2), S. Newport (n=1), S. Grupensis (n=1), S. Uganda (n=1) y S. Braenderup (n=1) los serotipos presentes en pacientes con gastroenteritis. El MLST indico que un tipo de secuencia común (ST11) de S. Enteritidis estuvo presente en todas las tres fuentes y mostraron el mismo patrón de resistencia antibiótica.

Conclusión. S. Enteritidis ST11 constituye un vínculo entre el consumo/manipulación de huevos contaminados y gastroenteritis humana en Ibagué. Son necesarios estudios complementarios para conocer si otros serovares de Salmonella aislados de carne de pollo cruda también se asocian con la gastroenteritis humana."

Our objective was to determine the properties of these sequence variations with regard to prevalence, the range of variation, and effect on disease prognosis. We screened a multi-national cohort (n = 6981) for the HREM and samples with deviant RP-PCR curves were identified. The deviant samples were subsequently sequenced to determine sequence alteration. Our results show that in the USA and European cohorts (n = 6508) 10.7% carried the HREM and 3% had a sequence variant, while no HREM or sequence variants were observed in the Japanese cohort (n = 473).

RBPs often recognize their RNA targets in a specific manner. In addition to the RNA primary sequence, the structure of the RNA has been shown to play a central role in RNA recognition by RBPs. In recent years, many experimental approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, were developed and employed to identify and characterize RBP targets and extract their binding specificities. In vivo binding techniques, such as CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP)-based methods, enable the characterization of protein binding sites on RNA targets. However, these methods do not provide information regarding the structural preferences of the protein. While methods to obtain the structure of RNA are available, inferring both the sequence and the structure preferences of RBPs remains a challenge. Here we present SMARTIV, a novel computational tool for discovering combined sequence and structure binding motifs from in vivo RNA binding data relying on the sequences of the target sites, the ranking of their binding scores and their predicted secondary structure. The combined motifs are provided in a unified representation that is informative and easy for visual perception. We tested the method on CLIP-seq data from different platforms for a variety of RBPs.

By varying the position of single 8-oxoG in a functional gene and manipulating the nucleotide sequence surrounding the lesion, we found that the degree of transcriptional inhibition is independent of the distance from the transcription start or the localization within the transcribed or the non-transcribed DNA strand. However, it is strongly dependent on the sequence context and also proportional to cellular expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-demonstrating that transcriptional arrest does not take place at unrepaired 8-oxoG and proving a causal connection between 8-oxoG excision and the inhibition of transcription. We identified the 5'-CAGGGC[8-oxoG]GACTG-3' motif as having only minimal transcription-inhibitory potential in cells, based on which we predicted that 8-oxoG excision is particularly inefficient in this sequence context. This anticipation was fully confirmed by direct biochemical assays. Furthermore, in DNA containing a bistranded Cp[8-oxoG]/Cp[8-oxoG] clustered lesion, the excision rates differed between the two strands at least by a factor of 9, clearly demonstrating that the excision preference is defined by the DNA strand asymmetry rather than the overall geometry of the double helix or local duplex stability.

It is known that the methylation state of these regions confers transcriptional control over their associated genes. Given its governance on the transcriptome, cellular functions and identity, genome-wide DNA methylation pattern is tightly regulated and evidently predefined. However, how is the methylation pattern determined in vivo remains enigmatic. Based on in silico and in vitro evidence, recent studies proposed that the regional hypomethylated state is primarily determined by local DNA sequence, e.g., high CpG density and presence of specific transcription factor binding sites. Nonetheless, the dependency of DNA methylation on nucleotide sequence has not been carefully validated in vertebrates in vivo. Herein, with the use of medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model, the sequence dependency of DNA methylation was intensively tested in vivo. Our statistical modeling confirmed the strong statistical association between nucleotide sequence pattern and methylation state in the medaka genome. However, by manipulating the methylation state of a number of genomic sequences and reintegrating them into medaka embryos, we demonstrated that artificially conferred DNA methylation states were predominantly and robustly maintained in vivo, regardless of their sequences and endogenous states. This feature was also observed in the medaka transgene that had passed across generations. Thus, despite the observed statistical association, nucleotide sequence was unable to autonomously determine its own methylation state in medaka in vivo. Our results apparently argue against the notion of the governance on the DNA methylation by nucleotide sequence, but instead suggest the involvement of other epigenetic factors in defining and maintaining the DNA methylation landscape. Further investigation in other vertebrate models in vivo will be needed for the generalization of our observations made in medaka."

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of Hfq in the regulation by sRNAs binding to the 5'-untranslated mRNA regions. However, it remains unknown how Hfq affects those sRNAs that target the coding sequence. Here, the contribution of Hfq to the annealing of three sRNAs, RybB, SdsR, and MicC, to the coding sequence of Salmonella ompD mRNA was investigated. Hfq bound to ompD mRNA with tight, subnanomolar affinity. Moreover, Hfq strongly accelerated the rates of annealing of RybB and MicC sRNAs to this mRNA, and it also had a small effect on the annealing of SdsR. The experiments using truncated RNAs revealed that the contributions of Hfq to the annealing of each sRNA were individually adjusted depending on the structures of interacting RNAs. In agreement with that, the mRNA structure probing revealed different structural contexts of each sRNA binding site. Additionally, the annealing of RybB and MicC sRNAs induced specific conformational changes in ompD mRNA consistent with local unfolding of mRNA secondary structure. Finally, the mutation analysis showed that the long AU-rich sequence in the 5'-untranslated mRNA region served as an Hfq binding site essential for the annealing of sRNAs to the coding sequence. Overall, the data showed that the functional specificity of Hfq in the annealing of each sRNA to the ompD mRNA coding sequence was determined by the sequence and structure of the interacting RNAs."

Whether such a catalytic RNA could emerge in an RNA World or not, there would need to be prior routes to increasing complexity in order to produce it. It is hypothesized here that increasing sequence variety, if not complexity, can in fact readily emerge in response to a dynamic equilibrium between synthesis and degradation. A model system in which T4 RNA ligase catalyzes synthesis and Benzonase catalyzes degradation was constructed. An initial 20-mer served as a seed and was subjected to 180 min of simultaneous ligation and degradation. The seed RNA rapidly disappeared and was replaced by an increasing number and variety of both larger and smaller variants. Variants of 40-80 residues were consistently seen, typically representing 2-4% of the unique sequences. In a second experiment with four individual 9-mers, numerous variants were again produced. These included variants of the individual 9-mers as well as sequences that contained sequence segments from two or more 9-mers. In both cases, the RNA products lack large numbers of point mutations but instead incorporate additions and subtractions of fragments of the original RNAs. The system demonstrates that if such equilibrium were established in a prebiotic world it would result in significant exploration of RNA sequence space and likely increased complexity. It remains to be seen if the variety of products produced is affected by the presence of small peptide oligomers."

We show that monomeric XPD unwinds duplex DNA in 1-bp steps, yet exhibits frequent backsteps and undergoes conformational transitions manifested in 5-bp backward and forward steps. Quantifying the sequence dependence of XPD stepping dynamics with near base pair resolution, we provide the strongest and most direct evidence thus far that forward, single-base pair stepping of a helicase utilizes the spontaneous opening of the duplex.

In its host responses and serological properties, AVB-PX most resembled AVB-T, whereas AVB-6A most resembled AVB-O. Complete genomic sequences of the RNA-1 and RNA-2 of each isolate were obtained following high-throughput sequencing of RNA extracts from isolates preserved for 38 (AVB-PX) or 32 (the other 3 isolates) years, and compared with a genomic sequence of AVB-O obtained previously (PV-0082). RNA-2 was unexpectedly divergent compared to RNA-1, with the nucleotide (nt) sequence identity of different AVB isolates varying by up to 76% (RNA-2) and 89% (RNA-1). The coat protein amino acid sequences were the most divergent, with AVB-O and AVB-6A having only 68% identity to AVB-T and AVB-PX. Since the RNA2 sequence differences between the two isolate groupings also coincided with host range, symptom, and serological differences, AVB demonstrates considerable intraspecific divergence."

Importantly, such elements are known to be tissue-specifically expressed and to play a widespread role in gene regulation across thousands of genomic loci. However, very little is known of the mechanisms for the evolutionary biogenesis of these RNA elements, especially given their poor conservation across species. It has been proposed that lincRNAs might arise from pseudogenes. To test this systematically, we developed a novel method that searches for remnants of protein-coding sequences within lincRNA transcripts; the hypothesis is that we can trace back their biogenesis from protein-coding genes or posterior transposon/retrotransposon insertions. Applying this method, we found 203 human lincRNA genes with regions significantly similar to protein-coding sequences. Our method provides a visualization tool to trace the evolutionary biogenesis of lincRNAs with respect to protein-coding genes by sequence divergence. Subsequently, we show the expression correlation between lincRNAs and their identified parental protein-coding genes using public RNA-seq repositories, hinting at novel gene regulatory relationships. In summary, we developed a novel computational methodology to study non-coding gene sequences, which can be applied to identify the evolutionary biogenesis and function of lincRNAs."

Here, we tested the hypothesis that β- and γ-actin functions are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence, using targeted editing of the mouse genome. Although previous studies have shown that disruption of β-actin gene critically impacts cell migration and mouse embryogenesis, we demonstrate here that generation of a mouse lacking β-actin protein by editing β-actin gene to encode γ-actin protein, and vice versa, does not affect cell migration and/or organism survival. Our data suggest that the essential in vivo function of β-actin is provided by the gene sequence independent of the encoded protein isoform. We propose that this regulation constitutes a global 'silent code' mechanism that controls the functional diversity of protein isoforms."

Arabidopsis thaliana encodes an ortholog of the DNA primase-helicase from bacteriophage T7, dubbed AtTwinkle, that localizes in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Herein, we report that AtTwinkle synthesizes RNA primers from a 5'-(G/C)GGA-3' template sequence. Within this sequence, the underlined nucleotides are cryptic, meaning that they are essential for template recognition but are not instructional during RNA synthesis. Thus, in contrast to all primases characterized to date, the sequence recognized by AtTwinkle requires two nucleotides (5'-GA-3') as a cryptic element. The divergent zinc finger binding domain (ZBD) of the primase module of AtTwinkle may be responsible for template sequence recognition. During oligoribonucleotide synthesis, AtTwinkle shows a strong preference for rCTP as its initial ribonucleotide and a moderate preference for rGMP or rCMP incorporation during elongation. RNA products synthetized by AtTwinkle are efficiently used as primers for plant organellar DNA polymerases. In sum, our data strongly suggest that AtTwinkle primes organellar DNA polymerases during lagging strand synthesis in plant mitochondria and chloroplast following a primase-mediated mechanism. This mechanism contrasts to lagging-strand DNA replication in metazoan mitochondria, in which transcripts synthesized by mitochondrial RNA polymerase prime mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ."

Here, we investigate these relationships by leveraging the sequence diversity of endogenous genes and recently available genome-wide estimates of translation efficiency. We show that-after accounting for predicted mRNA structure-aSD sequence complementarity increases the translation of endogenous mRNAs by roughly 50%. Further, we observe that this relationship is nonlinear, with translation efficiency maximized for mRNAs with intermediate levels of aSD sequence complementarity. The mechanistic insights that we observe are highly robust: we find nearly identical results in multiple datasets spanning three distantly related bacteria. Further, we verify our main conclusions by re-analysing a controlled experimental dataset."

Here, we characterized the sequence specificity of eight other members of the Mini-III RNase family from different bacterial species. High-throughput analysis of the cleavage products of Φ6 bacteriophage dsRNA indicated subtle differences in sequence preference between these RNases, which were confirmed and characterized by systematic analysis of the cleavage kinetics of a set of short dsRNA substrates.

Recently, the R. solanacearum species complex strains have been reclassified into three genospecies: R. solanacearum, Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum and Ralstonia syzygii. An unidentified R. solanacearum strain is considered a select agent in the US until proven to be a non-race 3 biovar 2 (non-phylotype IIB sequevars 1&2). Currently, sequevars of R. solanacearum species complex strains can only be determined by phylogenetic analysis of a partial endoglucanase (egl) sequence of approximately 700-bp in length. Such analysis, however, requires expert knowledge to properly trim the sequence, to include the correct reference strains, and to interpret the results. By comparing GenBank egl sequences of representative R. solanacearum species-complex strains, we identified genospecies- and sequevar 1 and 2-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also designed primers to amplify a shorter, 526-bp, egl fragment from R. solanacearum species complex strains for easy sequencing of the amplicon, and to facilitate direct and specific amplification of egl from R. solanacearum-infected plant samples without the need of bacterial isolation. We wrote a computer program (Ralstonia solanacearum typing program) that analyzes a minimum 400-bp user-input egl sequence from a R. solanacearum strain for egl homology and SNP content to determine 1) whether it belongs to the R. solanacearum species complex, 2) if so, to which genospecies, and 3) whether it is of the sequevar type (sequevars 1 and 2) associated with the select agent/quarantined R. solanacearum strain. The program correctly typed all 371 tested egl sequences with known sequevars, obtained either from GenBank or through personal communication. Additionally, the program successfully typed 25 R. solanacearum strains in our collection with no prior sequevar information, as well as 4 strains in infected plant samples, using their partial egl sequences amplified and sequenced with primers designed in this study. The Ralstonia solanacearum typing program does not require expertise or specific knowledge to use, gives results in seconds, and provides data interpretation for the user. The program and primers can help expert or non-expert users to quickly type an unknown R. solanacearum species-complex strain and determine whether it is a highly regulated R. solanacearum strain. The program can also serve as a confirmation method, since it is the only method that can easily and directly determine whether the strain in question is a sequevar 1 or 2 strain of R. solanacearum.

The isolate from the USA was complete sequenced. The genome is 7592 bp in length and contains three open reading frames with an arrangement similar to that of other members of the genus Badnavirus. The largest open reading frame (ORF3) encodes a putative polyprotein, with predicted domains including zinc finger, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNase H, in that order. The USA and Nigeria isolates of the virus had a high level (98%) of nucleotide sequence identity in the RT+RNase H region. Within the genus Badnavirus, these viruses were most closely related to schefflera ringspot virus (SRV), sharing 63% identity at the nucleotide level. Based on the ICTV species demarcation criteria for the genus Badnavirus (more than 20% nucleotide sequence divergence in the RT+RNase H region), the Polyscias virus is proposed to be a new member of the genus, and the name polyscias mosaic virus (PoMV) is proposed.

The database included two types of probes with signals derived from (i) a combination of specific signal and cross-hybridization and (ii) genomic cross-hybridization only. All probes from the database were grouped into bins according to their sequence characteristics, where both hybridization signals were averaged separately. For selection of specific probes, we analyzed the following sequence characteristics: vulnerability to self-folding, nucleotide composition bias, numbers of G nucleotides and GGG-blocks, and occurrence of probe's k-mers in the human genome. Increases in bin ranges for these characteristics are simultaneously accompanied by a decrease in hybridization specificity-the ratio between specific and cross-hybridization signals. However, both averaged hybridization signals exhibit growing trends along with an increase of probes' binding energy, where the hybridization specific signal increases significantly faster in comparison to the cross-hybridization. The same trend is evident for the S function, which serves as a combined evaluation of probe binding energy and occurrence of probe's k-mers in the genome. Application of S allows extracting a larger number of specific probes, as compared to using only binding energy. Thus, we showed that high values of specific and cross-hybridization signals are not mutually exclusive for probes with high values of binding energy and S. In this study, the application of a new set of sequence characteristics allows detection of probes that are highly specific to their targets for array design and other bio-techniques that require selection of specific probes."

We explore a novel approach involving sequence-specific covalent cross-linking of a probe to target DNA combined with single-molecule nanopore detection of the cross-linked DNA. Here, we exploited the selective reaction of mechlorethamine at a C-C mismatch for covalent capture of a target DNA sequence corresponding to a cancer-driving mutation at position 1799 of the human BRAF kinase gene. We then demonstrated that the α-hemolysin protein nanopore can be employed for the unambiguous, single-molecule detection of the cross-linked probe-target complex.

In this work, we make a systematic analysis of RBP-RNA and RNA-RNA datasets to better characterize the interaction landscape with information about multi-motifs on the same RNAs. To achieve this goal, we updated our BEAM algorithm to combine both sequence and structure information to create pairs of patterns that model motifs of interaction. This algorithm was applied to several RNA binding proteins and ncRNAs interactors, confirming already known motifs and discovering new ones. This landscape analysis on interaction variability reflects the diversity of target recognition and underlines that often both primary and secondary structure are involved in molecular recognition."

At shallow timescales, such as within species, RAD-Seq has been widely adopted among researchers, although there has been little discussion of the potential limitations and benefits of RAD-Seq and sequence capture. We discuss a series of issues that may impact the utility of sequence capture and RAD-Seq data for shallow systematics in non-model species. We review prior studies that used both methods, and investigate differences between the methods by re-analyzing existing RAD-Seq and sequence capture data sets from a Neotropical bird (Xenops minutus). We suggest that the strengths of RAD-Seq data sets for shallow systematics are the wide dispersion of markers across the genome, the relative ease and cost of laboratory work, the deep coverage and read overlap at recovered loci, and the high overall information that results. Sequence capture's benefits include flexibility and repeatability in the genomic regions targeted, success using low-quality samples, more straightforward read orthology assessment, and higher per-locus information content. The utility of a method in systematics, however, rests not only on its performance within a study, but on the comparability of data sets and inferences with those of prior work. In RAD-Seq data sets, comparability is compromised by low overlap of orthologous markers across species and the sensitivity of genetic diversity in a data set to an interaction between the level of natural heterozygosity in the samples examined and the parameters used for orthology assessment. In contrast, sequence capture of conserved genomic regions permits interrogation of the same loci across divergent species, which is preferable for maintaining comparability among data sets and studies for the purpose of drawing general conclusions about the impact of historical processes across biotas. We argue that sequence capture should be given greater attention as a method of obtaining data for studies in shallow systematics and comparative phylogeography."

Co-occurrence of both interrupted and intronless SOC1 genes was detected in few Brassica species. In silico analysis characterised Brassica SOC1 as MADS intervening, K-box, C-terminal (MIKC(C)) transcription factor, with highly conserved MADS and I domains relative to K-box and C-terminal domain. Phylogenetic analyses and multiple sequence alignments depicting shared pattern of silent/non-silent mutations assigned Brassica SOC1 homologs into groups based on shared diploid base genome. In addition, a sub-genome structure in uncharacterised Brassica genomes was inferred. Expression analysis of putative MF2 and LF (Brassica diploid base genome A (AA)) sub-genome-specific SOC1 homeologs of Brassica juncea revealed near identical expression pattern. However, MF2-specific homeolog exhibited significantly higher expression implying regulatory diversification. In conclusion, evidence for polyploidy-induced sequence and regulatory evolution in Brassica SOC1 is being presented wherein differential homeolog expression is implied in functional diversification."

The results suggested that 08TC170 was the product of both intertypic recombination and point mutation, whose effects on viral neurovirulence will be investigated in a further study. The high homology between 08TC170 and other strains revealed their co-circulation in mainland China and Hong Kong and indicates that further surveillance is needed. "

The p53-binding affinity and the activity of CATTAG were lower than for the mutant CATATG core sequence. Wild-type p53 acts as a tetramer to bind to the whole site; however, it also can bind to a half site by one of its dimers. Wild-type p53 can only bind to a half site with core sequence CATG but not to CATATG. The 1.5-fold half site or whole site with core sequence CATATG can be bound by wild-type p53. A p53 mutant, A344, forms dimeric p53; it can only bind to CATG, and not to CATATG.

Typically, they are structurally disordered in the inactive state, but in response to an external stimulus, like a suitable ligand, they change their conformation, thereby activating DNA transcription in a spatiotemporal fashion. The observed disorder or fuzziness is functionally beneficial because it can add adaptability, versatility, and reversibility to the interaction. In this context, mimetics of the basic region of the GCN4 transcription factor (Tf) and their interaction with dsDNA sequences would be suitable models to explore the concept of conformational fuzziness experimentally. Herein, we present the first example of a system that mimics the DNA sequence-specific recognition by the GCN4 Tf through the formation of a non- covalent tetra-component complex: peptide-azoβ-CyD(dimer)-peptide-DNA. The non-covalent complex is constructed on the one hand by a 30 amino acid peptide corresponding to the basic region of GCN4 and functionalized with an adamantane moiety, and on the other hand an allosteric receptor, the azoCyDdimer, that has an azobenzene linker connecting two β-cyclodextrin units. The azoCyDdimer responds to light stimulus, existing as two photo-states: the first thermodynamically stable with an E:Z isomer ratio of 95:5 and the second obtained after irradiation with ultraviolet light, resulting in a photostationary state with a 60:40 E:Z ratio. Through electrophoretic shift assays and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the E isomer is responsible for dimerization and recognition. The formation of the non-covalent tetra component complex occurs in the presence of the GCN4 cognate dsDNA sequence ('5-..ATGA cg TCAT..-3') but not with ('5-..ATGA c TCAT..-3') that differs in only one spacing nucleotide. Thus, we demonstrated that the tetra-component complex is formed in a specific manner that depends on the geometry of the ligand, the peptide length, and the ds DNA sequence. We hypothesized that the mechanism of interaction is sequential, and it can be described by the polymorphism model of static fuzziness. We argue that chemically modified peptides of the GCN4 Tf are suitable minimalist experimental models to investigate conformational fuzziness in protein-DNA interactions."

Three incomplete ALS genes were identified in the genome sequence for Candida orthopsilosis strain 90-125 (GenBank assembly ASM31587v1): CORT0C04210 (named CoALS4210), CORT0C04220 (CoALS4220) and CORT0B00800 (CoALS800). To complete the gene sequences, new data were derived from strain 90-125 using Illumina (short-read) and Oxford Nanopore (long-read) methods. Long-read sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of 3 ALS genes in C. orthopsilosis 90-125 and resolved the gaps located in repetitive regions of CoALS800 and CoALS4220. In the new genome assembly (GenBank PQBP00000000), the CoALS4210 sequence was slightly longer than in the original assembly. C. orthopsilosis Als proteins encoded features well-known in C. albicans Als proteins such as a secretory signal peptide, N-terminal domain with a peptide-binding cavity, amyloid-forming region, repeated sequences, and a C-terminal site for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition that, in yeast, suggest localization of the proteins in the cell wall. CoAls4210 and CoAls800 lacked the classic C. albicans Als tandem repeats, instead featuring short, imperfect repeats with consensus motifs such as SSSEPP and GSGN. Quantitative RT-PCR showed differential regulation of CoALS genes by growth stage in six genetically diverse C. orthopsilosis clinical isolates, which also exhibited length variation in the ALS alleles, and strain-specific gene expression patterns. Overall, long-read DNA sequencing methodology was instrumental in generating an accurate assembly of CoALS genes, thus revealing their unconventional features and first insights into their allelic variability within C. orthopsilosis clinical isolates."

We found that protein expression was increased when a gene sequence of Dictyostelium discoideum was placed upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence located between the promoter and the initiation codon of a target gene. The most effective sequence among the genes examined was mlcR, which encodes the myosin regulatory light chain, a subunit of myosin II. Serial deletion analysis revealed that at least 10 bases of the 3' end of the mlcR gene enhanced the production of green fluorescent protein in cells.

Thus, current protein production systems can be improved by combination with TED."

The genome-wide bleomycin cleavage data were analysed by four different methods to determine the cellular DNA sequence specificity of bleomycin strand breakage. For the most highly cleaved DNA sequences, the preferred site of bleomycin breakage was at 5'-GT* dinucleotide sequences (where the asterisk indicates the bleomycin cleavage site), with lesser cleavage at 5'-GC* dinucleotides. This investigation also determined longer bleomycin cleavage sequences, with preferred cleavage at 5'-GT*A and 5'- TGT* trinucleotide sequences, and 5'-TGT*A tetranucleotides. For cellular DNA, the hexanucleotide DNA sequence 5'-RTGT*AY (where R is a purine and Y is a pyrimidine) was the most highly cleaved DNA sequence. It was striking that alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences were highly cleaved by bleomycin. The highest intensity cleavage sites in cellular and purified DNA were very similar although there were some minor differences. Statistical nucleotide frequency analysis indicated a G nucleotide was present at the -3 position (relative to the cleavage site) in cellular DNA but was absent in purified DNA. "

Aptamers with high binding-affinity and target specificity are identified using an in vitro procedure called high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (HT-SELEX). However, the development of aptamer affinity reagents takes a considerable amount of time and is costly because HT-SELEX produces a large dataset of candidate sequences, some of which have insufficient binding-affinity. Here, we present RNA aptamer Ranker (RaptRanker), a novel in silico method for identifying high binding-affinity aptamers from HT-SELEX data by scoring and ranking. RaptRanker analyzes HT-SELEX data by evaluating the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure simultaneously, and by ranking according to scores reflecting local structure and sequence frequencies. To evaluate the performance of RaptRanker, we performed two new HT-SELEX experiments, and evaluated binding affinities of a part of sequences that include aptamers with low binding-affinity. In both datasets, the performance of RaptRanker was superior to Frequency, Enrichment and MPBind. We also confirmed that the consideration of secondary structures is effective in HT-SELEX data analysis, and that RaptRanker successfully predicted the essential subsequence motifs in each identified sequence."

They are maintained by telomerase that adds short G-rich telomeric repeats at chromosomal ends in most eukaryotes and determines the TnAmGo sequence of canonical telomeres. We employed an experimental approach that was based on detection of repeats added by telomerase to identify the telomere sequence type forming the very ends of chromosomes. Our previous studies that focused on the algal order Chlamydomonadales revealed several changes in telomere motifs that were consistent with the phylogeny and supported the concept of the Arabidopsis-type sequence being the ancestral telomeric motif for green algae. In addition to previously described independent transitions to the Chlamydomonas-type sequence, we report that the ancestral telomeric motif was replaced by the human-type sequence in the majority of algal species grouped within a higher order clade, Caudivolvoxa. The Arabidopsis-type sequence was apparently retained in the Polytominia clade. Regarding the telomere sequence, the Chlorogonia clade within Caudivolvoxa bifurcates into two groups, one with the human-type sequence and the other group with the Arabidopsis-type sequence that is solely formed by the Chlorogonium species. This suggests that reversion to the Arabidopsis-type telomeric motif occurred in the common ancestral Chlorogonium species. The human-type sequence is also synthesized by telomerases of algal strains from Arenicolinia, Dunaliellinia and Stephanosphaerinia, except a distinct subclade within Stephanosphaerinia, where telomerase activity was not detected and a change to an unidentified telomeric motif might arise. We discuss plausible reasons why changes in telomeric motifs were tolerated during evolution of green algae."

The most stable triplexes form on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences, and pyrimidine interruptions in the purine strand are destabilizing. Sequence stringency is imparted by specific Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds between third strand bases and the purine bases in the duplex. Appropriate base and sugar modifications of triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) confer chromosome targeting activity in living cells. However, broad utilization of TFOs as gene targeting reagents in mammalian cells has been limited by the requirement for homopurine target sequences. Although there have been a number of base analogues described that appear to be promising as candidates for triplex target expansion, none has been examined in a biological system. We have employed a postsynthetic strategy to prepare a collection of TFOs with base analogues at a defined position. Following assessment of affinity for a triplex target with a single C:G inversion, TFOs with a second generation of analogues were synthesized. One of these, TFO-5a, with 2'-OMe-guanidinylethyl-5-methylcytosine at the position corresponding to the C:G interruption in the target sequence, was further modified to confer bioactivity. The activity of this TFO, linked to psoralen, was measured in a mammalian cell line that was engineered by directed sequence conversion to carry a triplex target with a single C:G interruption. TFO-5a was active against this target and inactive against the corresponding target with an uninterrupted polypurine:polypyrimidine sequence."

Both finite-range and long-range correlated situations are considered. It is shown that finite-range correlations increase stability of DNA with respect to the external unzipping force. Due to long-range correlations the number of unzipped base pairs displays two widely different scenarios depending on the details of the base sequence: either there is no unzipping phase transition at all, or the transition is realized via a sequence of jumps with magnitude comparable to the size of the system. Both scenarios are different from the behavior of the average number of unzipped base pairs (non-self-averaging). The results can be relevant for explaining the biological purpose of correlated structures in DNA."

Here we show, through the use of modified hardware, that we are able to simultaneously analyze multiple (4) samples, and detect a 26-mer ssDNA sequence at femtomolar concentrations in minutes. As such, this work represents an improvement in throughput and a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity, compared to that reported previously. Here, we also investigate the design parameters of the target sequence, in an effort to maximize the sensitivity of HIA and to use as a guide in future applications of this work. Modifications were made to the original 26-mer oligonucleotide sequence to evaluate the effects of: (1) non-complementary flanking bases, (2) target sequence length, and (3) single base mismatches on aggregation response. The aggregation response decreased as the number of the non-complementary flanking bases increased, with only a five base addition lowering the LOD by four orders of magnitude. Low sensitivity was observed with short sequences of 6 and 10 complementary bases, which were only detectable at micromolar concentrations. Target sequences with 20, 26 or 32 complementary bases provided the greatest sensitivity and were detectable at femtomolar concentrations. Additionally, HIA could effectively differentiate sequences that were fully complementary from those containing 1, 2 or 3 single base mismatches at micromolar concentrations. The robustness of the HIA system to other buffer components was explored with nine potential assay interferents that could affect hybridization (aggregation) or falsely induce aggregation. Of these, purified BSA and lysed whole blood induced a false aggregation. None of the interferents inhibited aggregation when the hybridizing target was added. Having delineated the fundamental parameters affecting HIA-target hybridization, and demonstrating that HIA had the selectivity to detect single base mismatches, this fluor-free end-point detection has the potential to become a powerful tool for microfluidic DNA detection.

The variant carrying the insertion appears to be less damaging than the one with the deletion. A possible explanation could be that the additional sequence is located in the C to E interhelical region, and is less disturbing to the general structure of the globin chain. This insertion/deletion (ins/del) is likely favored by the repetition, at an interval of 16 nucleotides, of an eight nucleotide sequence.

Here, we discovered that two short sequence motifs at the 3' end of the targeting sequence are almost exclusively present in inefficient sgRNAs of published sgRNA-activity datasets. By specific knock-in of sgRNA target sequences with or without these motifs and quantitative measurement of knockout efficiency, we show that the presence of these motifs in sgRNAs per se results in a 10-fold reduction of gene knockout frequencies. Mechanistically, the cause of the low efficiency differs between the two motifs. These sequence motifs are relevant for future sgRNA design approaches and studies of Cas9-DNA interactions."

Comparing closely related genomes sheds light on molecular events shaping phage evolution. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) variations impart over half of the genomic changes between T7M and T3, indicating an important role of SSRs in accelerating phage genetic divergence. Differences in coding and noncoding regions of phages infecting different hosts, coliphages T7M and T3, Yersinia phage ϕYeO3-12, and Salmonella phage ϕSG-JL2, frequently arise from SSR variations. Such variations modify noncoding and coding regions; the latter efficiently changes multiple amino acids, thereby hastening protein evolution. Four classes of events are found to drive SSR variations: insertion/deletion of SSR units, expansion/contraction of SSRs without alteration of genome length, changes of repeat motifs, and generation/loss of repeats. The categorization demonstrates the ways SSRs mutate in genomes during phage evolution. Indels are common constituents of genome variations and human diseases, yet, how they occur without preexisting repeat sequence is less understood. Non-repeat-unit-based misalignment-elongation (NRUBME) is proposed to be one mechanism for indels without adjacent repeats. NRUBME or consecutive NRUBME may also change repeat motifs or generate new repeats. NRUBME invoking a non-Watson-Crick base pair explains insertions that initiate mononucleotide repeats. Furthermore, NRUBME successfully interprets many inexplicable human di- to tetranucleotide repeat generations. This study provides the first evidence of SSR variations expediting phage divergence, and enables insights into the events and mechanisms of genome evolution. NRUBME allows us to emulate natural evolution to design indels for various applications."

Sequence analysis revealed that Ad/AsIFNe1-3 and Ad/AsIFNγ contain several conserved characteristics, including signal peptides, interferon alpha, beta, and delta (IFabd) domains, and N-glycosylation sites. Ad/AsIFNe1-3 belongs to the type I IFN group I subgroup, possessing two conserved cysteines residues (C1 and C3), and Ad/AsIFNγ contained a conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif.

These IFNs were separated by four phase 0 introns (type I IFN) and three phase 0 introns (type II IFN). The sequences of IFNe1-3 and IFNγ from the Dabry's sturgeon and the Chinese sturgeon were closely aligned, suggested that these two species are closely related. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ad/AsIFNe1-3 and Ad/AsIFNγ clustered together with the corresponding homologous proteins from other fish species. AdIFNe1-3 were found to be high expressed in early embryonic development, suggesting that AdIFNe1-3 might indicate maternal transmission, while AdIFNγ may not mediate embryonic development. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that AdIFNe1-3 and AdIFNγ carry out biological functions in immune and non-immune tissues compartments. AdIFNe1-3 and AdIFNγ can be stimulated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

Expression of MSTN appeared to be correlated with muscle development and growth of African catfish. Protein bioinformatics revealed that the primary sequence of Cg-MSTN shared 98 % sequence identity with that of walking catfish Cm-MSTN with only two different residues, [Formula: see text]. and [Formula: see text]. The proposed model of Cg-MSTN revealed the key point mutation [Formula: see text] causing a 7.35 Å shorter distance between the N- and C-lobes and an approximately 11° narrow angle than those of Cm-MSTN.

However, to date, molecular mechanisms underlying the potential adaptation of bumblebees to diverse habitats are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate how TRs contribute to genetic variation in bumblebees, thus potentially facilitating adaptation. We identified 26,595 TRs from the assembled 18 chromosome sequences of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), 66.7% of which reside in genic regions. We also compared TRs found in B. terrestris with those present in the assembled genome sequence of a congener, B. impatiens. We found that a total of 1,137 TRs were variable in length between the two sequenced bumblebee species, and further analysis reveals that 101 of them are located within coding regions. These 101 TRs are responsible for coding sequence variation and correspond to protein sequence length variation between the two bumblebee species. The variability of identified TRs in coding regions between bumblebees was confirmed by PCR amplification of a subset of loci. Functional classification of bumblebee genes where coding sequences include variable-length TRs suggests that a majority of genes (87%) that could be assigned to a protein class are related to transcriptional regulation. Our results show that TRs contribute to coding sequence variation in bumblebees, and thus may facilitate the adaptation of bumblebees through diversifying proteins involved in controlling gene expression."

By coupling NGS, primer-walking strategies, and sequence-independent protocols to obtain the sequences of the 5' and 3' termini, we reconstructed the genome sequence of picornavirus strain ITA/2017/189/18-155. The genome of the bat picornavirus is 8.2 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein of 2462 amino acids. A comparison of polyprotein sequences revealed that this virus is distantly related (65.1% and 70.9% sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively) to a bat aichivirus identified in 2010. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this picornavirus clustered closely with members of the genus Kobuvirus, which also includes human and animal aichiviruses.

They affect a gene expression by binding of fully or partially complementary sequences to the 3'-UTR of target mRNA. Furthermore, miRNAs present a mechanism by which genes with diverse functions on multiple pathways can be simultaneously regulated at the post-transcriptional level. However, little is known about the specific pathways through which miRNAs with specific sequence or structural motifs regulate the cellular processes. In this paper we showed the broad and deep characteristics of mature miRNAs according to their sequence and structural motifs. We investigated a distinct group of miRNAs characterized by the presence of specific sequence motifs, such as UGUGU, GU-repeats and purine/pyrimidine contents. Using computational function and pathway analysis of their targeted genes, we were able to observe the relevance of sequence and the type of targeted mRNAs. As the consequence of the sequence analysis we finally provide the comprehensive description of pathways, biological processes and proteins associated with the distinct group of characterized miRNAs. Here, we found that the specific group of miRNAs with UGUGU can activate the targets associated to the interferon induction pathway or pathways prominently observed during carcinogenesis. GU-rich miRNAs are prone to regulate mostly processes in neurogenesis, whereas purine/pyrimidine rich miRNAs could be involved rather in transport and/or degradation of RNAs. Additionally, we have also analyzed the simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Their variation within mature miRNAs might be critical for normal miRNA regular activity. Expansion or contraction of SSRs in mature miRNA might directly affect its mRNA interaction or even change the function of that distinct miRNA. Our results prove that due to the specific sequence features, these molecules can also be involved in well-defined cellular processes depending on their sequence contents. The pathway mapping and theoretical gene target identification allowed us to create a biological framework to show the relevance of the specific miRNAs in regulation the distinct type of targets. "

The goal of this study was genotyping of clinical isolates of C. glabrata by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) technique for determination of the endemic prevalent genotypes and any association between isolation source and drug resistance. A total of 50 C. glabrata clinical isolates from Iran were analyzed by MLST and tested for in-vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin-B, caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A4 document guidelines. Among these isolates, 16 distinct STs were identified, indicating a discriminatory power index of 0.9029. The three major sequence types (STs) were ST-59, ST-74, and ST-7 with 10, 8, and 7 isolates, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 11 new sequences were found, to which no allele numbers were assigned in the MLST database. All the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Fluconazole resistance was shown in four isolates. Also, a sole isolate was voriconazole resistant. This study shows that the population structure of C. glabrata in Iran consists of groups closely related to the global database as well as to some new clonal clusters and STs. Regarding the high prevalence of 11 new sequences found in this study, it can be concluded that, these new alleles are among the endemic genotypes of Iran. The genotypes or STs were independent of drug susceptibility and anatomic sources."

The drawback of sequence length polymorphisms is that nucleotide substitutions remain undetected. As some laboratories have opted for using length polymorphisms, while others have relied on sequencing, there is a need to compare both methods. We used a diversified set of unique length polymorphisms and matching nucleotide sequences to assess the ability of each genotyping protocol to discern clusters of related Cryptosporidium parvum isolates. We found a weak correlation between the two distance measures for individual markers. This analysis was extended to four-locus genotypes based on sequence length data or concatenated sequences from the same loci. We interrogated these data to assess whether one would reach the same conclusions regardless of the genotyping method. Clusters of isolates generated with the concatenated sequences were not observed with amplicon length, indicating that inferences on the structure of a Cryptosporidium population depend on the genotyping method. Moreover, isolate clusters derived from concatenated sequences were dependent on the algorithm used to calculate distances. These results emphasize the need for harmonizing genotyping tools, not only by selecting informative markers, but also by standardizing the entire genotyping method. "

Global relationships between nucleotide composition of 3' UTR sequences and their sequence conservation have been appreciated since mammalian genomes were first sequenced, but the functional relevance of these patterns remain unknown. We systematically measured the effect on gene expression of the sequences of more than 25,000 RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites in primary mouse T cells using a massively parallel reporter assay. GC-rich sequences were destabilizing of reporter mRNAs and come from more rapidly evolving regions of the genome. These sequences were more likely to be folded in vivo and contain a number of structural motifs that reduced accumulation of a heterologous reporter protein. Comparison of full-length 3' UTR sequences across vertebrate phylogeny revealed that strictly conserved 3' UTRs were GC-poor and enriched in genes associated with organismal development. In contrast, rapidly evolving 3' UTRs tended to be GC-rich and derived from genes involved in metabolism and immune responses. Cell-essential genes had lower GC content in their 3' UTRs, suggesting a connection between unstructured mRNA noncoding sequences and optimal protein production. By reducing gene expression, GC-rich RBP-occupied sequences act as a rapidly evolving substrate for gene regulatory interactions."

In this study, an agarolytic strain was isolated from a saltwater hot spring and identified as Microbulbifer pacificus LD25 by 16S rRNA. The whole genome sequence of M. pacificus LD25 was obtained. It had a size of 4.27 Mb and comprised 3062 predicted genes in 37 contigs with a G+C content of 58.0%. Six agarases were annotated and classified into three families, namely, GH16 (AgaL1), GH86 (AgaL2, AgaL3), and GH50 (AgaL4, AgaL5, AgaL6), which shared 75-96% identities with unpublished hypothetical proteins and agarases. AgaL1, AgaL4, and AgaL6 can be successfully expressed and purified in Escherichia coli. AgaL1 and AgaL4 displayed a significantly agarolytic capability, whereas AgaL6 exhibited a rarely detectable enzymatic activity. The optimal temperature and pH required for the activity of AgaL1 and AgaL4 was 50°C and 60°C, respectively, at pH 7. The specific activities of AgaL1 and AgaL4 were achieved at 16.8 and 9.6 U per mg of protein. Both agarases were significantly inhibited in the presence of EDTA, MgO, ZnCl"

In this study, we report molecular characterization of a cDNA sequence encoded of BCL-2 from striped murrel, Channa striatus. A partial cDNA sequence of CsBCL-2 was identified from the striped murrel cDNA library during annotation. Subsequently, the full length CsBCL-2 cDNA sequence was obtained by an internal sequencing method using a forward primer. The sequence contains 699 nucleotide base pairs which encode 232 amino acid residues. The domain and motif analysis revealed that the CsBCL-2 polypeptide consists of BCL-2 homologous domain BH4 at the N-terminal region between 4 and 21 and the BCL-2 homologous domains BH1, BH2 and BH3 between 87 and 187. The CsBCL-2 polypeptide sequence does not have a signal peptide region, but it consists of two novel transmembrane regions at 134-152 and 209-226. The sequence analysis showed that the CsBCL-2 has highest sequence identity (70%) with BCL-2 like protein 1 (BCL-2 L1) from pufferfish Takifugu rubripes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CsBCL-2 was situated in the BCL-2 L1 fish clade. The secondary analysis showed that the CsBCL-2 protein consists of 132 amino acid residues in the α-helical region and 100 amino acid residues in the random coil region. The validated 3D structure of CsBCL-2 showed the active residues Gly(135) and Arg(136) in the 7th α-helical position, whereas Trp(178) is in the 9th α-helical region. CsBCL-2 mRNA transcription is predominately present in spleen and is upregulated upon being induced with fungus Aphanomyces invadans, bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli LPS, Laminaria digitata beta-1,3-glucan and poly I:C. Overall, the CsBCL-2 mRNA transcription results indicate the potential involvement of CsBCL-2 in immune system of C. striatus. However, further research at proteomic level is necessary to examine these predictions. "

We have characterised the sequence and methylation of grain amyloplast DNA and leaf chloroplast DNA in rice. We have also analysed the changes in methylation patterns in the chloroplast DNA as the rice plant ages. Total genomic DNA from grain, old leaf and young leaf tissues were extracted from the Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. MR219 and sequenced using Illumina Miseq. Sequence variant analysis revealed that the amyloplast and chloroplast DNA of MR219 were identical to each other. However, comparison of CpG and CHG methylation between the identical amyloplast and chloroplast DNA sequences indicated that the chloroplast DNA from rice leaves collected at early ripening stage was more methylated than the amyloplast DNA from the grains of the same plant. The chloroplast DNA became more methylated as the plant ages so that chloroplast DNA from young leaves was less methylated overall than amyloplast DNA. These differential methylation patterns were primarily observed in organelle-encoded genes related to photosynthesis followed by those involved in transcription and translation."

Fis binds DNA primarily through DNA backbone contacts and selects target sites by reading conformational properties of DNA sequences, most prominently intrinsic minor groove widths. High-affinity binding requires Fis-stabilized DNA conformational changes that vary depending on DNA sequence. In order to better understand the molecular basis for high affinity site recognition, we analyzed the effects of DNA sequence within and flanking the core Fis binding site on binding affinity and DNA structure. X-ray crystal structures of Fis-DNA complexes containing variable sequences in the noncontacted center of the binding site or variations within the major groove interfaces show that the DNA can adapt to the Fis dimer surface asymmetrically. We show that the presence and position of pyrimidine-purine base steps within the major groove interfaces affect both local DNA bending and minor groove compression to modulate affinities and lifetimes of Fis-DNA complexes. Sequences flanking the core binding site also modulate complex affinities, lifetimes, and the degree of local and global Fis-induced DNA bending. In particular, a G immediately upstream of the 15 bp core sequence inhibits binding and bending, and A-tracts within the flanking base pairs increase both complex lifetimes and global DNA curvatures. Taken together, our observations support a revised DNA motif specifying high-affinity Fis binding and highlight the range of conformations that Fis-bound DNA can adopt. The affinities and DNA conformations of individual Fis-DNA complexes are likely to be tailored to their context-specific biological functions. "

Several genome-wide profiling methods have been developed for detecting mRNA degradation in plants and animals. However, because many of these techniques use poly (A) mRNA for library preparation, degradation intermediates are often only detected near the 3'-ends of transcripts. Previously, we developed the Truncated RNA End Sequencing (TREseq) method using Arabidopsis thaliana, and demonstrated that this method ameliorates 3'-end bias. In analyses using TREseq, we observed G-rich sequences near the 5'-ends of degradation intermediates. However, this finding remained to be confirmed in other plant species. Hence, in this study, we conducted TREseq analyses in Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Oryza sativa (rice) and Rosa hybrida (rose). These species including A. thaliana were selected to encompass a diverse range in the angiosperm phylogeny. The results revealed similar sequence features near the 5'-ends of degradation intermediates, and involvement of translation process in all four species. In addition, homologous genes have similar efficiencies of mRNA degradation in different plants, suggesting that similar mechanisms of mRNA degradation are conserved across plant species. These strong sequence features were not observed in previous degradome analyses among different species in plants."

Although MNase has been known for its sequence preference in DNA digestions, we confirmed that this sequence preference is overwhelmed by DNA accessibility by identifying the sequence-driven and accessibility-driven cleavages. Specifically, we find that sequences favoured by MNase at the end regions such as TA dinucleotide are prohibited from cleavage at the internal sites in the early stage of digestion. Nevertheless, sequences less favoured by MNase at the end regions such as AA/TT dinucleotide are predominantly cleaved at the internal sites in the early stage of digestion. Since AA/TT is known as a rigid dinucleotide step resistant to DNA bending, these internal cleavages reflect the local site exposures induced by DNA mechanics. As the DNA entry site of +1 nucleosomes in yeast is found AA/TT-rich, this sequence element may play a role in gene activation by reducing DNA-histone affinities along the direction of DNA transcription."

We report that a G-rich sequence in the non-template strand reduces the yield of T7 RNA polymerase transcription by more than an order of magnitude when positioned close (9 bp) to the promoter, in comparison to that for a distal (∼250 bp) location of the same sequence. This transcription blockage is much less pronounced for a C-rich sequence, and is not significant for an A-rich sequence. Remarkably, the blockage is not pronounced if transcription is performed in the presence of RNase H, which specifically digests the RNA strands within RNA-DNA hybrids. The blockage also becomes less pronounced upon reduced RNA polymerase concentration. Based upon these observations and those from control experiments, we conclude that the blockage is primarily due to the formation of stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), which inhibit successive rounds of transcription. Our results could be relevant to transcription dynamics in vivo (e.g. transcription 'bursting') and may also have practical implications for the design of expression vectors."

Experimental correlations have been established between the local nucleotide content of DNA and the frequency of inter- and intra-chromosomal contacts but the underlying physical mechanism remains unknown. Here, we combine fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, precipitation assays, and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the effect of DNA nucleotide content, sequence, and methylation on inter-DNA association and its correlation with DNA looping. First, we show that the strength of DNA condensation mediated by poly-lysine peptides as a reduced model of histone tails depends on the DNA's global nucleotide content but also on the local nucleotide sequence, which turns out to be qualitatively same as the condensation by spermine. Next, we show that the presence and spatial arrangement of C5 methyl groups determines the strength of inter-DNA attraction, partially explaining why RNA resists condensation. Interestingly, multi-color single molecule FRET measurements reveal strong anti-correlation between DNA looping and DNA-DNA association, suggesting that a common biophysical mechanism underlies them. We propose that the differential affinity between DNA regions of varying sequence pattern may drive the phase separation of chromatin into chromosomal subdomains."

Here, we describe the isolation of a novel satellite DNA family (PMSat) from the rodent Peromyscus eremicus (Cricetidae, Rodentia), which is located in pericentromeric regions and exhibits a typical satellite DNA genome organization. Orthologous PMSat sequences were isolated and characterized from three species belonging to Cricetidae: Cricetus cricetus, Phodopus sungorus and Microtus arvalis. In these species, PMSat is highly conserved, with the absence of fixed species-specific mutations. Strikingly, different numbers of copies of this sequence were found among the species, suggesting evolution by copy number fluctuation. Repeat units of PMSat were also found in the Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii BioProject, but our results suggest that these repeat units are from genome regions outside the pericentromere. The remarkably high evolutionary sequence conservation along with the preservation of a few numbers of copies of this sequence in the analyzed genomes may suggest functional significance but a different sequence nature/organization. Our data highlight that repeats are difficult to analyze due to the limited tools available to dissect genomes and the fact that assemblies do not cover regions of constitutive heterochromatin. "

Recently, remarkable compression performance of individual DNA sequence from the same population is achieved by encoding its difference with a nearly identical reference sequence. Nevertheless, there is lack of general algorithms that also allow less similar reference sequences. In this work, we extend the intra-sequence to the inter-sequence similarity in that approximate matches of subsequences are found between the DNA sequence and a set of reference sequences. Hence, a set of nearly identical DNA sequences from the same population or a set of partially similar DNA sequences like chromosome sequences and DNA sequences of related species can be compressed together. For practical compressors, the compressed size is usually influenced by the compression order of sequences. Fast search algorithms for the optimal compression order are thus developed for multiple sequences compression. Experimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed multiple sequences compression methods with fast compression order search are able to achieve good compression performance under different levels of similarity in the multiple DNA sequences.

ODNs are potent stimulators of the immune response in cells expressing TLR9. Despite extensive use of mice as experimental animals in basic and applied immunological research, the key sequence determinants that govern the activation of mouse TLR9 by ODNs have not been well defined. We performed a systematic investigation of the sequence motif of B class phosphodiester ODNs to identify the sequence properties that govern mouse TLR9 activation. In contrast to ODNs activating human TLR9, where the minimal sequence motif for the receptor activation comprises a pair of closely positioned CpGs we found that the mouse TLR9 requires a single CpG positioned 4-6 nt from the 5'-end. Activation is augmented by a 5'TCC sequence one to three nucleotides from the CG. The distance of the CG dinucleotide of four to six nucleotides from the 5'-end and the ODN's length fine-tunes activation of mouse macrophages. Length of the ODN <23 and >29 nt decreases activation of dendritic cells. The ODNs with minimal sequence induce Th1-type cytokine synthesis in dendritic cells and confirm the expression of cell surface markers in B cells. Identification of the minimal sequence provides an insight into the sequence selectivity of mouse TLR9 and points to the differences in the receptor selectivity between species probably as a result of differences in the receptor binding sites.

Mismatches between the target and CRISPR RNA guide outside the seed have minor effects on target binding, thus contributing to off-target activity of CRISPR-Cas effectors.

Herein, we significantly improved mRNA stability by using synthetic repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences as an effective mRNA stabilizer in two typical prokaryotic microbes, namely, Escherichia coli for the production of cyclodextrin glucosyltransferase (CGTase) and Corynebacterium glutamicum for the production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). First, we performed a high-throughput screen to select 4 out of 380 REP sequences generated by randomizing 6 nonconservative bases in the REP sequence designed as the degenerate base ""N."" Secondly, the REP sequence was inserted at several different positions after the stop codon of the CGTase-encoding gene. We found that mRNA stability was improved only when the space between the REP sequence and stop codon was longer than 12 base pairs (bp). Then, by reconstructing the spacer sequence and secondary structure of the REP sequence, a REP sequence with 8 bp in a stem-loop was obtained, and the CGTase activity increased from 210.6 to 291.5 U/ml. Furthermore, when this REP sequence was added to the 3'-UTR of glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 ( GNA1), which is a gene encoding a key enzyme GNA1 in the GlcNAc synthesis pathway, the GNA1 activity was increased from 524.8 to 890.7 U/mg, and the GlcNAc titer was increased from 4.1 to 6.0 g/L in C. glutamicum. These findings suggest that the REP sequence plays an important function as an mRNA stabilizer in prokaryotic cells to stabilize its 3'-terminus of the mRNA by blocking the processing action of the 3'-5' exonuclease. Overall, this study provides new insight for the high-efficiency overexpression of target genes and pathway fine-tuning in bacteria."

The binding constants estimated for poly(dA-dT)2 and poly(dA)poly(dT) revealed that (1) binds more preferentially to poly(dA)poly(dT) than to poly(dA-dT)2, and vice versa for (2). The intermolecular NOE and chemical shift change of the oligonucleotides, d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 (ODN1) and d(CGCGTATACGCG)2 (ODN2) indicated that the two complexes bound to the minor grooves at AT-rich site of the ODNs from the ""en"" bridging side. The difference in the sequence specificity between (1) and (2) was attributed to the difference in the width of the minor groove; (2) recognized the wider minor groove of ODN2 'TATA' region. In contrast to (1) and (2), the asymmetric complex (3) bound to the major groove at terminal GC-rich site of ODN1. In this study, we could reveal that hydrophobic interaction is an important factor for base sequence recognition and an appropriate modification of the salen could switch the binding site from minor to major groove of DNA."

An example of systems biology datasets, protein binding microarrays, contain activity data from about 40,000 such sequences. The discrepancy between the number of possible configurations and the available activities is enormous. Thus, albeit that systems biology datasets are large in absolute terms, they oftentimes require methods developed for rare events due to the combinatorial increase in the number of possible configurations of biological systems. A plethora of techniques for handling large datasets, such as Empirical Bayes, or rare events, such as importance sampling, have been developed in the literature, but these cannot always be simultaneously utilized. Here we introduce a principled approach to Empirical Bayes based on importance sampling, information theory, and theoretical physics in the general context of sequence phenotype model induction. We present the analytical calculations that underlie our approach. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the approach on concrete examples, and demonstrate its efficacy by applying the theory to publicly available protein binding microarray transcription factor datasets and to data on synthetic cAMP-regulated enhancer sequences. As further demonstrations, we find transcription factor binding motifs, predict the activity of new sequences and extract the locations of transcription factor binding sites. In summary, we present a novel method that is efficient (requiring minimal computational time and reasonable amounts of memory), has high predictive power that is comparable with that of models with hundreds of parameters, and has a limited number of optimized parameters, proportional to the sequence length.

We compared the nucleosomal DNA patterns in mouse, human and yeast organisms and observed few distinctive patterns that can be termed as packing and regulatory referring to distinctive modes of chromatin function. For the first time the NPS patterns in nucleus accumbens cells (NAC) in mouse brain were characterized and compared to the patterns in human CD4+ and apoptotic lymphocyte cells and well studied patterns in yeast. The NPS patterns in human CD4+ cells and mouse brain cells had very high positive correlation. However, there was no correlation between them and patterns in human apoptotic lymphocyte cells and yeast, but the latter two were highly correlated with each other. By their dinucleotide arrangements the analyzed NPS patterns classified into stable canonical WW/SS (W = A or T and S = C or G dinucleotide) and less stable RR/YY (R = A or G and Y = C or T dinucleotide) patterns and anti-patterns. In the anti-patterns positioning of the dinucleotides is flipped compared to those in the regular patterns. Stable canonical WW/SS patterns and anti-patterns are ubiquitously observed in many organisms and they had high resemblance between yeast and human apoptotic cells. Less stable RR/YY patterns had higher positive correlation between mouse and normal human cells.

We introduce a workflow to generate reliable collections of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and indels by leveraging available genomic resources to inform variant calling using the GATK. The workflow is demonstrated for the crop plant Sorghum bicolor by (i) generating an initial set of variants using reduced representation sequence data from an experimental cross and association panels, (ii) using the initial variants to inform variant calling from whole-genome sequence data of resequenced individuals, and (iii) using variants identified from whole-genome sequence data for recalibration of the reduced representation sequence data. The reliability of variants called with the workflow is verified by comparison with genetically mappable variants from an independent sorghum experimental cross. Comparison with a recent sorghum resequencing study shows that the workflow identifies an additional 1.62 million high-confidence variants from the same sequence data. Finally, the workflow's performance is validated using Arabidopsis sequence data, yielding variant call sets with 95% sensitivity and 99% positive predictive value.

We tested the cutting of synthetic hairpins containing all possible combinations of dinucleotides following the recognition site and our results show that all sequences containing one adenine following GGATG were digested more efficiently. We further show that the same sequence preference is also observable in double stranded DNA at higher Mg2+ concentrations and even in optimal conditions. Kinetic results show that BtsCI has a noteworthy difference in the first-rate constants between different sequences and between the two catalytic domains. An increase in Mg2+ resulted in a drastic decrease in the catalytic activity of the top (sense) strand that wasn't always accompanied by a nick in the bottom strand (antisense)."

Three G-A alkylating dimers have been reported in publications to date, with defined DNA-binding sites proposed for two of them. In this study we have used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate preferred DNA-binding sites for the three published molecular types. For the PBD-CPI dimer UTA-6026 (1), our simulations correctly predicted its favoured binding site (i.e., 5'-C(G)AATTA-3') as identified by DNA cleavage studies. However, for the PBD-CI molecule ('Compound 11', 3), we were unable to reconcile the results of our simulations with the reported preferred cross-linking sequence (5'-ATTTTCC(G)-3'). We found that the molecule is too short to span the five base pairs between the A and G bases as claimed, but should target instead a sequence such as 5'-ATTTC(G)-3' with two less base pairs between the reacting G and A residues. Our simulation results for this hybrid dimer are also in accord with the very low interstrand cross-linking and in vitro cytotoxicity activities reported for it. Although a preferred cross-linking sequence was not reported for the third hybrid dimer ('27eS', 2), our simulations predict that it should span two base pairs between covalently reacting G and A bases (e.g., 5'-GTAT(A)-3')."

We showed that 168 residues (out of the 390 residues composing the human TUFT1 sequence) are under purifying selection. Our analyses identified several, new, putatively functional domains and confirmed previously described functional domains, such as the TIP39 interaction domain, which correlates with nuclear localization of the TUFT1 protein, that was demonstrated in several tissues. We also identified several sites under positive selection, which could indicate evolutionary changes possibly related to the functional diversification of TUFT1 during evolution in some lineages. We discovered that TUFT1 and MYZAP (myocardial zonula adherens protein) share a common ancestor that was duplicated circa 500 million years ago.

The genetic heterogeneity exhibited by these cells can be exploited to understand the population dynamics of cloned cell lines. Understanding the interplay between heterogeneity, cell culture conditions, and population dynamics will allow for critical assessment of overarching cell line development methods and strategies in terms of population and monoclonality. Sequence variants (SVs) are protein isoforms of the gene-of-interest that contain unintended amino acid substitutions, extensions, or truncations that may contribute to heterogeneity. In this case, SVs are unique sequences in the genome of the integrated transgene that can be used as biomarkers to understand the heterogeneity of a monoclonal cell line and how production process conditions can impact population dynamics. In this study, orthogonal genetic and analytical methods were used to examine the variability of SV levels in four different SV-containing cell lines under varied culture conditions and generational ages. Culture conditions tested had little to no impact on SV levels. However, generational age studies showed two distinct trends: stability of SV levels out to approximately 100 generations in cell lines with higher level SVs (>10%) and a progressive decrease of SV levels as the cells age to approximately 100 generations in cell lines with lower level SVs (<10%). The results suggest that the four SV-containing cell lines fall into two distinct population models; SVs present in the whole population of cells and SVs present in only a sub-population of cells. The data presented here are one of the first studies to not only analyze and compare SV levels in both genetic and protein material but also to utilize SVs as biomarkers to probe distinct populations of cloned cell lines.

Current nucleotide data repositories archive only RNA sequence data. Furthermore, storage formats which can frugally represent RNA sequence as well as structure data in a single file, are currently unavailable. This article proposes a novel storage format, 'FASTR', for concomitant representation of RNA sequence and structure. The storage efficiency of the proposed FASTR format has been evaluated using RNA data from various microorganisms. Results indicate that the size of FASTR formatted files (containing both RNA sequence as well as structure information) are equivalent to that of FASTA-format files, which contain only RNA sequence information. RNA secondary structure is typically represented using a combination of a string of nucleotide characters along with the corresponding dot-bracket notation indicating structural attributes. 'FASTR' - the novel storage format proposed in the present study enables a frugal representation of both RNA sequence and structural information in the form of a single string. In spite of having a relatively smaller storage footprint, the resultant 'fastr' string(s) retain all sequence as well as secondary structural information that could be stored using a dot-bracket notation.

We here present a new importance sampling approach for approximating the full likelihood function for the selection coefficient. Our method CLUES treats the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) as a latent variable that is integrated out using previously published Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The method can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, testing models of changes in the strength of selection, estimating the time of the start of a selective sweep, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the method and show that it uniformly improves power to detect selection compared to current popular methods such as nSL and SDS, and can provide reliable inferences of allele frequency trajectories under many conditions. We also explore the potential of our method to detect extremely recent changes in the strength of selection. We use the method to infer the past allele frequency trajectory for a lactase persistence SNP (MCM6) in Europeans. We also infer the trajectory of a SNP (EDAR) in Han Chinese, finding evidence that this allele's age is much older than previously claimed. We also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants. Several genes show evidence of strong selection particularly within the last 5,000 years, including ASIP, KITLG, and TYR. However, selection on OCA2/HERC2 seems to be much older and, in contrast to previous claims, we find no evidence of selection on TYRP1."

Only two direct targets of these miRNAs (ZEB 1 and WNT5A) are commonly down regulated in response to over-expression of miR-205 and/or the miR-200 family of miRNAs.

The process of cyclizing short DNA, as a critical step in molecular cloning, lacks a comprehensive picture of the kinetic process containing sequence information. We have elucidated this process by using coarse-grained simulations, enhanced sampling methods, and recent theoretical advances. We are able to identify the types and positions of structural defects during the looping process at a base-pair level. Correlations along a DNA molecule dictate critical sequence positions that can affect the looping rate. Structural defects change the bending elasticity of the DNA molecule from a harmonic to subharmonic potential with respect to bending angles. We explore the subelastic chain as a possible model in loop formation kinetics. A sequence-dependent model is developed to qualitatively predict the relative loop formation time as a function of DNA sequence. "

Recently, M. bovis has emerged as a significant health problem in bison, causing necrotic pharyngitis, pneumonia, dystocia and abortion. Whether isolates from cattle and bison comprise genetically distinct populations is unknown. This study describes the development of a highly discriminatory multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) method for M. bovis and its use to investigate the population structure of the bacterium. Genome sequences from six M. bovis isolates were used for selection of gene targets. Seven of 44 housekeeping genes initially evaluated were selected as targets on the basis of sequence variability and distribution within the genome. For each gene target sequence, four to seven alleles could be distinguished that collectively define 32 sequence types (STs) from a collection of 94 cattle isolates and 42 bison isolates. A phylogeny based on concatenated target gene sequences of each isolate revealed that bison isolates are genetically distinct from strains that infect cattle, suggesting recent disease outbreaks in bison may be due to the emergence of unique genetic variants. No correlation was found between ST and disease presentation or geographic origin. MLST data reported here were used to populate a newly created and publicly available, curated database to which researchers can contribute. The MLST scheme and database provide novel tools for exploring the population structure of M. bovis and tracking the evolution and spread of strains. "

Families with recurrent, early-onset MDD (RE-MDD), a severe, familial form of MDD, have provided an important resource for identifying and characterizing genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MDD and related disorders. Previous studies identified a rare, highly penetrant A(-115)G transition within the human CREB1 promoter that reduced promoter activity in vitro and was associated with depressive disorders in RE-MDD families. The development of an etiology-based recombinant animal model for MDD would facilitate the advancement of our limited understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as the development of improved treatments. Here we report the construction and initial characterization of a congenic mutant C57BL/6NTac mouse model that carries the human pathogenic sequence at the homologous position of the mouse Creb1 promoter. The recombinant strain exhibited decreases in reproductive capacity and pup survival that may be related to increased infant mortality observed in RE-MDD families; enlargement of the cerebral ventricles; reduced levels of CREB protein in the mouse cerebral cortex, as predicted from transfection experiments employing the pathogenic human CREB1 promoter; and alterations in two standardized behavioral tests, the forced swim and marble burying tests. These initial findings support the pathogenicity of the human A(-115)G promoter variant, and invite further characterization of this etiology-based recombinant animal model for MDD. Human promoter variants that have highly penetrant effects on disease expression provide an attractive opportunity for creating etiology-based mouse models of human diseases, with minimal disruption of the mouse genome."

In order to establish a high efficiency expression system for these genes, five different expression plasmids combining with 9 genes, viz. 6 LMW-GS and 3 α-gliadin genes isolated from common wheat and related species, were studied for heterologous expression in E. coli. In this study, when an expressed tag sequence encoding signal peptide, His-S or GST-tag was fused to the 5' end of LMW-GS or gliadin gene as the leading sequence, all recombination genes could be stably expressed at a high level. On the contrast, as expected, the inserted genes encoding mature protein failed without an expressed tag sequence. This result indicated that using expressed tag sequences as leading sequences could promote LMW-GS and gliadin genes to be well expressed in E. coli. Further transcriptional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed transcription levels of recombination genes (e.g. GST-Glutenin, His-S-Glutenin and SP(∗)-His-Glutenin) were 4-fold to 33-fold higher than those of the LMW-GS genes, which suggested these expressed tag sequences might play an important role in stimulating transcription.

The L RNA has 8905 nucleotides (nt) and encodes the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 2877 aa amino acids (aa) in the viral complementary (vc) strand. The RdRp of MVBaV shares the highest aa sequence identity (85.9%) with that of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), and contains conserved motifs shared with those of the species of the genus Tospovirus.

Prior studies of regulatory DNA and transcription factors across animal species highlighted a fundamental conundrum: Transcription factor binding domains and cognate binding sites are conserved, while regulatory DNA sequences are not. It remains unclear how conserved transcription factors and dynamic regulatory sites produce conserved expression patterns across species. Here, we explore regulatory DNA variation and its functional consequences within Arabidopsis thaliana, using chromatin accessibility to delineate regulatory DNA genome-wide. Unlike in previous cross-species comparisons, the positional homology of regulatory DNA is maintained among A. thaliana ecotypes and less nucleotide divergence has occurred. Of the ∼50,000 regulatory sites in A. thaliana, we found that 15% varied in accessibility among ecotypes. Some of these accessibility differences were associated with extensive, previously unannotated sequence variation, encompassing many deletions and ancient hypervariable alleles. Unexpectedly, for the majority of such regulatory sites, nearby gene expression was unaffected. Nevertheless, regulatory sites with high levels of sequence variation and differential chromatin accessibility were the most likely to be associated with differential gene expression. Finally, and most surprising, we found that the vast majority of differentially accessible sites show no underlying sequence variation. We argue that these surprising results highlight the necessity to consider higher-order regulatory context in evaluating regulatory variation and predicting its phenotypic consequences."

Additionally, a 70 bp tRNA(Thr)-tRNA(Pro) intergenic spacer is present. The C. globiceps mitogenome exhibited strand-specific asymmetry in nucleotide composition. The AT-skew and GC-skew values in the whole genome of C. globiceps were 0 and -0.2877, respectively, revealing that the H-strand had equal amounts of A and T and that the overall nucleotide composition was C skewed.

This permitted the determination of bleomycin cleavage specificity with high accuracy since end-label bias was greatly reduced. Bleomycin produces single- and double-strand breaks, abasic sites and other base damage in DNA. This high-precision method was utilised to elucidate, for the first time, the DNA sequence specificity of bleomycin-induced DNA damage at abasic sites. This was accomplished using endonuclease IV that cleaves DNA at abasic sites after bleomycin damage. It was found that bleomycin-induced abasic sites formed at 5'-GC and 5'-GT sites while bleomycin-induced phosphodiester strand breaks formed mainly at 5'-GT dinucleotides. Since bleomycin-induced abasic sites are produced in the absence of molecular oxygen, this difference in DNA sequence specificity could be important in hypoxic tumour cells."

We find that compared to a multiple sequence alignment approach, D2 methods are more robust against among-site rate heterogeneity, compositional biases, genetic rearrangements and insertions/deletions, but are more sensitive to recent sequence divergence and sequence truncation. Across diverse empirical datasets, the alignment-free methods perform well for sequences sharing low divergence, at greater computation speed.

The tetra-A loop is well-ordered with adenine residues 2-4 forming a 3' stack. This loop conformation stands in contrast to the structure of the 5'-AUUA loop of the related phage MS2 operator in which residues 1 and 2 form a 5' stack. The context dependence of the (A-A)-U sequence motif conformation was examined using structures of 76 unique occurrences from the Protein Data Bank. The motif almost always has one adenine bulged and the other adenine adopting an A-U base pair. In the case in which the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by only one Watson-Crick base pair, the adenine adjacent to the flanking base pair tends to bulge; 80% of motifs with a 3' flanking pair have a 3' bulged adenine, and 84% of motifs with a 5' flanking pair have a 5' bulged adenine.

We also designed a temperature gradient strategy for efficient separation of target DNA oligomers in DNA mixture samples. Using a column carrying two different probes with similar T (m) values, their complementary target DNA oligomers were also separated and detected. The developed DNA open tubular capillary column system investigated in the present study could be further improved as an alternative tool to DNA chips to be used for the quantitative analysis of DNA or mRNA samples."

Complex scaffold and staple routing needed to design wireframe DNA origami objects, however, render fully automated, geometry-based sequence design approaches essential for their synthesis. And wireframe DNA origami structural fidelity can be limited by wireframe edges that are composed only of one or two duplexes. Here we introduce a fully automated computational approach that programs 2D wireframe origami assemblies using honeycomb edges composed of six parallel duplexes. These wireframe assemblies show enhanced structural fidelity from electron microscopy-based measurement of programmed angles compared with identical geometries programmed using dual-duplex edges. Molecular dynamics provides additional theoretical support for the enhanced structural fidelity observed. Application of our top-down sequence design procedure to a variety of complex objects demonstrates its broad utility for programmable 2D nanoscale materials."

BLAST searches against the nucleotide and protein databases showed that this virus is closely related to but different from carrot torradovirus 1 (CaTV1). Comparisons between the two viruses demonstrated relatively low levels of nucleotide and amino acid similarity in different parts of their genomes, as well as considerable differences in the sizes of their two genomic RNAs. However, the protease-polymerase (Pro-Pol) and capsid protein (CP) regions of this virus share >80% amino acid identity with the corresponding regions of CaTV1.

The structural properties of DNA lesions that determine their relative susceptibilities to NER are therefore of great interest. As a model system, we have investigated the major mutagenic lesion derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 10S (+)-trans-anti-B[a]P-N(2)-dG in six different sequence contexts that differ in how the lesion is positioned in relation to nearby guanine amino groups. We have obtained molecular structural data by NMR and MD simulations, bending properties from gel electrophoresis studies, and NER data obtained from human HeLa cell extracts for our six investigated sequence contexts. This model system suggests that disturbed Watson-Crick base pairing is a better recognition signal than a flexible bend, and that these can act in concert to provide an enhanced signal. Steric hinderance between the minor groove-aligned lesion and nearby guanine amino groups determines the exact nature of the disturbances. Both nearest neighbor and more distant neighbor sequence contexts have an impact. Regardless of the exact distortions, we hypothesize that they provide a local thermodynamic destabilization signal for repair."

In this study, the β-defensin (Onβ-defensin) gene of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cloned from spleen tissue. Onβ-defensin has a genomic DNA sequence of 674 bp and produces a cDNA of 454 bp. Sequence alignments showed that Onβ-defensin contains three exons and two introns. Sequence analysis of the cDNA identified an open reading frame of 201 bp, encoding 66 amino acids. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Onβ-defensin encodes a cytoplasmic protein molecule containing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of this peptide contains six conserved cysteine residues and two conserved glycine residues, and shows 81.82% and 78.33% sequence similarities with β-defensin-1 of fugu (Takifugu rubripes) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the level of Onβ-defensin expression was highest in the skin (307.1-fold), followed by the spleen (77.3-fold), kidney (17.8-fold), and muscle (16.5-fold) compared to controls. By contrast, low levels of expression were found in the liver, heart, intestine, stomach, and gill (<3.0-fold). Artificial infection of tilapia with Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS] strain) resulted in a significantly upregulated expression of Onβ-defensin in the skin, muscle, kidney, and gill. In vitro antimicrobial experiments showed that a synthetic Onβ-defensin polypeptide had a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli DH5α and S. agalactiae. The results indicate that Onβ-defensin plays a role in immune responses that suppress or kill pathogens."

Despite their widespread use, the organization of balancer chromosomes has not been characterized at the molecular level, and the degree of sequence variation among copies of balancer chromosomes is unknown. To map inversion breakpoints and study potential diversity in descendants of a structurally identical balancer chromosome, we sequenced a panel of laboratory stocks containing the most widely used X chromosome balancer, First Multiple 7 (FM7). We mapped the locations of FM7 breakpoints to precise euchromatic coordinates and identified the flanking sequence of breakpoints in heterochromatic regions. Analysis of SNP variation revealed megabase-scale blocks of sequence divergence among currently used FM7 stocks. We present evidence that this divergence arose through rare double-crossover events that replaced a female-sterile allele of the singed gene (sn(X2)) on FM7c with a sequence from balanced chromosomes. We propose that although double-crossover events are rare in individual crosses, many FM7c chromosomes in the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center have lost sn(X2) by this mechanism on a historical timescale. Finally, we characterize the original allele of the Bar gene (B(1)) that is carried on FM7, and validate the hypothesis that the origin and subsequent reversion of the B(1) duplication are mediated by unequal exchange. Our results reject a simple nonrecombining, clonal mode for the laboratory evolution of balancer chromosomes and have implications for how balancer chromosomes should be used in the design and interpretation of genetic experiments in Drosophila.

Three types of HA CS sequences, QREKR/GL, QRKKR/GL and QRRKR/GL, were previously reported in Taiwanese H5N2 viruses that were isolated from chickens from 2003 to 2013. However, no HA CS sequence was reported for viruses isolated after 2013. This article presents the HA CS sequences and pathogenicity of H5N2 viruses that were isolated from chickens in Taiwan during 2013-2015. Two novel HA CS sequences, QKEKR/GL and KREKREKR/GL, were found in the viruses isolated in 2013 and 2014, and pathogenicity tests showed that the viruses with these novel HA CS sequences are low and high pathogenic viruses, respectively. In contrast, the HA CS sequence QREKR/GL was found in all viruses that were isolated in 2015, and all of these viruses were low pathogenic viruses. After 10 passages in embryonated chicken eggs, a virus strain that was isolated in 2003 evolved into a viral quasispecies that contained at least four distinct types of HA CS sequences. These results highlight the potential of Taiwanese H5N2 viruses to change their pathogenicity and HA CS sequences via mutations. Furthermore, viruses with the HA CS sequence QREKR/GL were more prevalent than others in 2015. These findings are useful for understanding the mechanism of sequence changes at the HA CS and for refining H5N2 virus control measures in Taiwan."

It has been known that the complexation of protein and DNA involves mutual conformational changes, especially for a specific sequence association. However, it is still unclear how the conformation and the information in the DNA sequences affects the binding process. What is the extent to which the DNA structure adopted in the complex is induced by protein binding, or is instead intrinsic to the DNA sequence? In this study, we used the multiscale simulation method to explore the binding process of a protein with DNA in terms of DNA sequence, conformation, and interactions. We found that in the approach stage the protein can bind both the major and minor groove of the DNA, but uses different features to locate the binding site. The intrinsic conformational properties of the DNA play a significant role in this binding stage. By comparing the specific DNA with the nonspecific in unbound, intermediate, and associated states, we found that for a specific DNA sequence, ∼40% of the bending in the association forms is intrinsic and that ∼60% is induced by the protein. The protein does not induce appreciable bending of nonspecific DNA. In addition, we proposed that the DNA shape variations induced by protein binding are required in the early stage of the binding process, so that the protein is able to approach, encounter, and form an intermediate at the correct site on DNA.

Chromosomal reorganizations were detected when comparing to sequences of S. reilianum, the closest smut relative, potentially influenced by repeats of transposable elements. Repetitive elements may have also directed the linkage of the two mating-type loci. The fungal transcriptome profiling from in vitro and from interaction with sugarcane at two time points (early infection and whip emergence) revealed that 13.5% of the genes were differentially expressed in planta and particular to each developmental stage. Among them are plant cell wall degrading enzymes, proteases, lipases, chitin modification and lignin degradation enzymes, sugar transporters and transcriptional factors. The fungus also modulates transcription of genes related to surviving against reactive oxygen species and other toxic metabolites produced by the plant. Previously described effectors in smut/plant interactions were detected but some new candidates are proposed. Ten genomic islands harboring some of the candidate genes unique to S. scitamineum were expressed only in planta. RNAseq data was also used to reassure gene predictions. "

On the other hand, our 3D homology study shows that Ageritin has a structural core consisting of an antiparallel β-sheet and an adjacent long α-helix, typical of ribotoxins and RNase T1 family, although the sheet has an orthogonal arrangement with respect to them. Thus, Ageritin is the first prototype of novel ribotoxin-like protein family from fungi."

In this study, a double-stranded (ds) RNA of 5322 base pairs (bp) in length from strain GY25 of B. dothidea was isolated and sequenced. The dsRNA potentially contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The predicted gene product of ORF1 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity, 37 % (E-value, 8e(-101)), to the capsid protein of Rosellinia necatrix victorivirus 1 (RnV1), and ORF2 had the highest similarity, 44 % (E-value, 0.0), to the RNA-directed RNA polymerase of Beauveria bassiana victorivirus NZL/1980(BbV-NZL/1980). Both of these viruses are members of the genus Victorivirus in the family Totiviridae. There was a small ORF at the 5' terminus whose predicted gene product did not show homology to any known proteins. The dsRNA from B. dothidea strain GY25 appears to be a genomic component of a victorivirus, which we have tentatively named ""Botryosphaeria dothidea victorivirus 1"" (BdV1). This is the first full-length genome sequence of a putative victorivirus infecting B. dothidea. "

The findings from previous proteomic and metabolomic studies of this strain can now be further interpreted with genomic analysis. Comparative analysis of the genome sequence revealed close similarity and localized synteny with the genome sequence of N. meningitidis serogroup C strain, FAM18. Polymorphisms were identified in the signal peptide sequence of factor H binding protein, a target for new meningococcal vaccines, which may result in its inefficient translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane affecting its processing (lipidation and cleavage of the signal peptide) and transportation to the outer membrane in strain L91543. This would explain the unusual proteomic data for factor H binding protein for this strain. NadA, another target for new vaccines, and the MtrR regulator, which controls expression of NadA, both contain SNPs between strains L91543 and FAM18. The genome sequence data were generated using Ion Torrent PGM sequencing, assembled into 50 contigs with 64× coverage and annotated with 2262 genes, 14 rRNAs and 56 tRNAs. The availability of the genome of N. meningitidis strain L91543 will aid our understanding of the proteome of this organism, importantly its vaccine antigens. "

In other words, measures of sequence and structure similarities are in general correlated - a high value of sequence similarity imposes a high value of structural similarity. However, important exceptions that stay in contrast to this general rule can be identified. It is possible to find similar structures with very different sequences, as well as similar sequences with very different structures. In this paper, we focus our attention on the latter case and propose a tool, called StructAnalyzer, supporting analysis of relations between the sequence and structure similarities. Recognition of tertiary structure diversity of molecules with very similar primary structures may be the key for better understanding of mechanisms influencing folding of RNAs or proteins, and as a result for better understanding of their function. StructAnalyzer allows exploration and visualization of structural diversity in relation to sequence similarity. We show how this tool can be used to screen RNA structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) for sequences with structural variants."

BTV serotype 7 is one of the prevalent BTV serotypes in Asia. Nonetheless, no complete genomic sequence of an Asian isolate of this serotype is available. In an effort to understand the molecular epidemiology of BTV infection in China, for the first time, we report here the complete genome sequence of a BTV serotype 7 strain, GDST008, which was isolated in 2014 in China. This sequence also represents the first complete genome sequence of a BTV serotype 7 from Asia and the third one in the world. Sequence analysis suggests that GDST008 consists of segments from BTV viruses of African lineage as well as those from China. Together, these results improve our understanding of the origin, emergence/re-emergence, and movement of BTV and thus can be applied in the development of vaccines and diagnostics. "

With the aim of producing the genuine CALB without additional amino acid residues, the mature portion of the CALB gene was fused seamlessly to a pelB signal sequence and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the pET system. Inducing gene expression at low temperature (20°C) was crucial for the production of active CALB; higher temperatures caused inclusion body formation. Prolonged induction for 48 h at 20°C allowed for the enzyme to be released into the culture medium, with more than half of the activity detected in the culture supernatant. A catalytically inactive CALB mutant (S105A) protein was similarly released, suggesting that the lipid-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme was not the reason for the release. The CALB production level was further improved by optimizing the culture medium. Under the optimized conditions, the CALB in the culture supernatant amounted to 550 mg/L. The recombinant CALB was purified from the culture supernatant, yielding 5.67 mg of purified CALB from 50 mL of culture. N-terminal sequencing and ESI-MS analyses showed proper removal of the pelB signal sequence and the correct molecular weight of the protein, respectively, confirming the structural integrity of the recombinant CALB. The kinetic parameters towards p-nitrophenylbutyrate and the enantiomeric selectivity on rac-1-phenylethylacetate of the recombinant CALB were consistent with those of the authentic CALB. This is the first example of E. coli-based extracellular production of a CALB enzyme without extra amino acid residues. "

Herein, we identified and analyzed this packaging signal in PERV and found hairpin structures with conserved tetranucleotides in their loops and nucleocapsid recognition sequences; both of which are key elements in the viral packaging signal of MLV. We evaluated packaging efficiency of sequence variants isolated from viral and proviral integrated genomes. All viral packaging sequences (Ψ) were identical, while five distinct packaging sequences were identified from proviral sources. One proviral sequence (Ψ1) was identical to that of the viral Ψ and had the highest packaging efficiency. Three variants (Ψ2, Ψ3, Ψ4) maintained key elements of the viral packaging signal, but had nucleotide replacements and consequently demonstrated reduced packaging efficiency. Despite of the same overall hairpin structure, the proviral variant (Ψ5) had only one GACG sequence in the hairpin loop and showed the lowest packaging efficiency other than ∆Ψ, in which the essential packaging sequence was removed. This result, thus, defined the packaging sequences in PERV and emphasized the importance of nucleotide sequence and RNA structure in the determination of packaging efficiency. In addition, we demonstrate efficient infection and gene expression from the PERV based viral vector, which may serve as a novel alternative to current retroviral expression systems."

In A. oryzae metabolism, transporters appear to play crucial roles in controlling the flux of molecules for energy generation, nutrients delivery, and waste elimination in the cell. While the A. oryzae genome sequence is available, transporter annotation remains limited and thus the connectivity of metabolic networks is incomplete. In this study, we developed a metabolic annotation strategy to understand the relationship between the sequence, structure, and function for annotation of A. oryzae metabolic transporters. Sequence-based analysis with manual curation showed that 58 genes of 12,096 total genes in the A. oryzae genome encoded metabolic transporters. Under consensus integrative databases, 55 unambiguous metabolic transporter genes were distributed into channels and pores (7 genes), electrochemical potential-driven transporters (33 genes), and primary active transporters (15 genes). To reveal the transporter functional role, a combination of homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to assess the relationship between sequence to structure and structure to function. As in the energy metabolism of A. oryzae, the H(+)-ATPase encoded by the AO090005000842 gene was selected as a representative case study of multilevel linkage annotation. Our developed strategy can be used for enhancing metabolic network reconstruction. "

Gene order closely matches that found in primates (including humans) and carnivores (including cats and dogs), which is inferred to be ancestral. Nevertheless, several protein-coding genes present on the human X Chromosome were absent from the pig, and 38 pig-specific X-chromosomal genes were annotated, 22 of which were olfactory receptors. The pig Y-specific Chromosome sequence generated here comprises 30 megabases (Mb). A 15-Mb subset of this sequence was assembled, revealing two clusters of male-specific low copy number genes, separated by an ampliconic region including the HSFY gene family, which together make up most of the short arm. Both clusters contain palindromes with high sequence identity, presumably maintained by gene conversion. Many of the ancestral X-related genes previously reported in at least one mammalian Y Chromosome are represented either as active genes or partial sequences. This sequencing project has allowed us to identify genes--both single copy and amplified--on the pig Y Chromosome, to compare the pig X and Y Chromosomes for homologous sequences, and thereby to reveal mechanisms underlying pig X and Y Chromosome evolution."

Here, we used single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers to study how Egr-1, a TF harboring three zinc fingers (ZF1, ZF2 and ZF3), is modulated by the sequence and context of its functional sites in the Lhb gene promoter. We find that both the core 9 bp bound to Egr-1 in each of the sites, and the base pairs flanking them, modulate the affinity and structure of the protein-DNA complex. The effect of the flanking sequences is asymmetric, with a stronger effect for the sequence flanking ZF3. Characterization of the dissociation time of Egr-1 revealed that a local, mechanical perturbation of the interactions of ZF3 destabilizes the complex more effectively than a perturbation of the ZF1 interactions. Our results reveal a novel role for ZF3 in the interaction of Egr-1 with other proteins and the DNA, providing insight on the regulation of Lhb and other genes by Egr-1. Moreover, our findings reveal the potential of small changes in DNA sequence to alter transcriptional regulation, and may shed light on the organization of regulatory elements at promoters."

The Ptz-dU-modified oligonucleotides were synthesised by means of a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling protocol and subsequent automated phosphoramidite chemistry. Br-dU represents a kinetic electron trap, since it undergoes a chemical modification after its one-electron reduction that can be analysed by piperidine-induced strand cleavage. The quantification of the strand cleavage yields from irradiation experiments reveals important information about the electron-transfer efficiency. The performed DNA studies focused on the base sequence dependence of the electron-transfer efficiency with respect to the proposal that C*- and T*- act as intermediate electron carriers during electron hopping. From our observations it became evident that excess-electron transfer is highly sequence dependent and occurs more efficiently over T-A base pairs than over C-G base pairs."

The sequence analysis data also showed the ITS2 region to be effective for interspecies characterization, though the 28S and 18S genes were found unsuitable for the purpose. On the other hand, sequence motif analysis data revealed the motifs from the COI gene to be highly conserved and specific for their target species which allowed accurate in silico identification of the gastrothylacid species irrespective of their intraspecific differences.

In bacteria, population divergence appears associated with a unique set of sequence-specific epigenetic DNA methylation systems, often within restriction-modification (RM) systems. They might define a unique gene expression pattern and limit genetic flux between lineages in population divergence. We addressed the contribution of methylation systems to population diversification in panmictic bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori, which shows an interconnected population structure through frequent mutual recombination. We analyzed complete genome sequences of 28 strains collected in Fukui, Japan. Their nucleotide sequences are closely related although fine-scale analyses revealed two subgroups likely reflecting human subpopulations. Their sequences are tightly connected by homologous recombination. Our extensive analysis of RM systems revealed an extreme variability in DNA methyltransferases, especially in their target recognition domains. Their diversity was, however, not immediately related to the genome sequence diversity, except for very closely related strains. An interesting exception is a hybrid strain, which likely has conserved the methylation gene repertoire from one parent but diversified in sequence by massive acquisition of fragmentary DNA sequences from the other parent. Our results demonstrate how a bacterial population can be extremely divergent in epigenetics and yet homogenized in sequence."

In this study, we aim to address the question of whether the catalytic activity of such a DNAzyme can be further optimized using in vitro selection. Several cycles of selective enrichment starting with a partially randomized DNA library have resulted in the isolation of many sequence variations that show notably improved catalytic activity. Bioinformatic analysis and activity examination of several DNAzyme-substrate constructs have led to two interesting findings about sequence mutations and the secondary structure of this DNAzyme: (1) three crucial mutations have transformed the DNAzyme into 8-17, a DNAzyme that has been discovered in multiple previous in vitro selection experiments, and (2) other mutations have allowed this special 8-17 variant to make structural fine-tuning in order to cleave an arbitrarily chosen RNA-containing substrate with a defined sequence. Our study not only showcases the combined power of directed molecular evolution and in vitro selection techniques in turning a noncatalytic nucleic acid sequence into an efficient enzyme, but it also raises the question of whether mother nature has used a similar approach to evolve natural enzymes.

In mammals, four subtypes of EP receptor (EP 1-4) are identified and each of them functions through different signal transduction pathways. Orthologous EP receptors have also been identified in other non-mammalian species, such as chicken and zebrafish. EP4 is the only identified PGE2 receptor to date in Atlantic salmon but its tissue distribution and function have not been studied in any detail. In this study, we first sequenced EP4 receptor in different tissues and found that the presence of the 3nt deletion in the 5' untranslated region was accompanied by silent mutation at nt 668. While attempting to amplify the same sequence in TO cells (an Atlantic salmon macrophage-like cell line), we failed to obtain the full-length product. Further investigation revealed different isoform of EP4 receptor in TO cells and we subsequently documented its presence in different Atlantic salmon tissues. These two isoforms of EP4 receptor share high homology in their first half of sequence but differ in the second half part with several deletion segments though the final length of coding sequence is the same for two isoforms. We further studied the immunomodulation effect of PGE2 in TO cells and found that PGE2 inhibited the induction of CXCL-10, CCL-4, IL-8 and IL-1β genes expression in a time dependent manner and without cAMP upregulation.

Despite the high degree of sequence similarity between the WTMV-Sn and WTMV-XC-1 isolates, the 349 nucleotides at the 5' terminus of WTMV-Sn appear to have originated by recombination with another isolate. The recombination parent remains unknown, but the recombination region shares 74.57% sequence identity with isolate WTMV-Laichau, which is below the species demarcation threshold for the genus Potyvirus. A pathogenicity test showed that WTMV-Sn can infect tobacco. This suggests that variation in the P1 cistron of WTMV-Sn may contribute to its ability to infect S. nigrum."

The discontinuous 30-amino acid deletions at positions 481 and 533-561 were found in the Nsp2-HVII of all Myanmarese PRRSVs, implying their derivation from HP-PRRSV. The phylogenetic trees also showed that Myanmarese strains were in the same group as other Southeast Asian strains from Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos suggesting their close relationships. Conversely, Vietnamese 07QN was in the same group as Chinese JXA1. The unique amino acid mutations found only in Myanmarese PRRSVs were L292F, P431S, and V621M in Nsp2-HVII and E170G in GP5, which may be used as a marker for monitoring genetic diversity of newly emerging HP-PRRSV strains."

Moreover, our approach reveals the relative importance of sequence-based features coming from both within the G4 motifs and their flanking regions. The developed model can be applied to any DNA sequence or genome to characterise sequence-driven intramolecular G4 formation propensities."

The distribution of the minor groove electrostatic potential is likely to be changing as a result of such conformational rearrangements in sugar-phosphate DNA backbone. Our analysis of the crystal structures of the short free DNA fragments and calculation of their electrostatic potentials allowed us to determine: (1) the number of classical and alternative γ angle conformations in the free B-DNA; (2) changes in the minor groove electrostatic potential, depending on the conformation of the sugar-phosphate DNA backbone; (3) the effect of the DNA sequence on the minor groove electrostatic potential. We have demonstrated that the structural adjustments of the DNA double helix (the conformations of the sugar-phosphate backbone and the minor groove dimensions) induce changes in the distribution of the minor groove electrostatic potential and are sequence-specific. Therefore, these features of the minor groove sizes and distribution of minor groove electrostatic potential can be used as a signal for recognition of the target DNA sequence by protein in the implementation of the indirect readout mechanism."

More recently, evidence has suggested that as much as half of all translation initiation utilizes non-AUG start codons, codons that deviate from AUG by a single base. Furthermore, non-AUG start codons have been shown to be involved in regulation of expression and disease etiology. Yet the ability to gauge expression based on the sequence of a translation initiation site (start codon and its flanking bases) has been limited. Here we have performed a comprehensive analysis of translation initiation sites that utilize non-AUG start codons. By combining genetic-reporter, cell-sorting, and high-throughput sequencing technologies, we have analyzed the expression associated with all possible variants of the -4 to +4 positions of non-AUG translation initiation site motifs. This complete motif analysis revealed that 1) with the right sequence context, certain non-AUG start codons can generate expression comparable to that of AUG start codons, 2) sequence context affects each non-AUG start codon differently, and 3) initiation at non-AUG start codons is highly sensitive to changes in the flanking sequences.

Here we develop a novel multiplexed assay to study promoter function in E. coli by building a site-specific genomic recombination-mediated cassette exchange system that allows for the facile construction and testing of large libraries of genetic designs integrated into precise genomic locations. We build and test a library of 10898 σ70 promoter variants consisting of all combinations of a set of eight -35 elements, eight -10 elements, three UP elements, eight spacers, and eight backgrounds. We find that the -35 and -10 sequence elements can explain approximately 74% of the variance in promoter strength within our data set using a simple log-linear statistical model. Simple neural network models explain >95% of the variance in our data set by capturing nonlinear interactions with the spacer, background, and UP elements."

In this paper, we propose a method that identifies, quantifies and annotates SNPs without any reference genome, using RNA-seq data only. Individuals can be pooled prior to sequencing, if not enough material is available from one individual. Using pooled human RNA-seq data, we clarify the precision and recall of our method and discuss them with respect to other methods which use a reference genome or an assembled transcriptome. We then validate experimentally the predictions of our method using RNA-seq data from two non-model species. The method can be used for any species to annotate SNPs and predict their impact on the protein sequence.

Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses, for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus.

Many RNases that cut RNA internally exhibit substrate specificity, but their target sites are usually limited to one or a few specific nucleotides in single-stranded RNA and often in a context of a particular three-dimensional structure of the substrate. Thus far, no RNase counterparts of restriction enzymes have been identified which could cleave double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we present evidence for a sequence-dependent cleavage of long dsRNA by RNase Mini-III from Bacillus subtilis (BsMiniIII). Analysis of the sites cleaved by this enzyme in limited digest of bacteriophage Φ6 dsRNA led to the identification of a consensus target sequence. We defined nucleotide residues within the preferred cleavage site that affected the efficiency of the cleavage and were essential for the discrimination of cleavable versus non-cleavable dsRNA sequences. We have also determined that the loop α5b-α6, a distinctive structural element in Mini-III RNases, is crucial for the specific cleavage, but not for dsRNA binding. Our results suggest that BsMiniIII may serve as a prototype of a sequence-specific dsRNase that could possibly be used for targeted cleavage of dsRNA. "

SCFG techniques model nested pairs and insertions, while MRF ideas handle crossing interactions and base triples. We use test sets of randomly-generated sequences to set acceptance and rejection thresholds for each motif group and thus control the false positive rate. Validation was carried out by comparing results for four motif groups to RMDetect. The software developed for sequence scoring (JAR3D) is structured to automatically incorporate new motifs as they accumulate in the RNA 3D Motif Atlas when new structures are solved and is available free for download."

Within this CARD approach, sequence or modification differences between two samples are identified through differential isotopic labeling of two samples. Components present in both samples will each be labeled, yielding doublets in the CARD mass spectrum. Components unique to only one sample should be detected as singlets. A limitation of the prior singlet identification strategy occurs when the two samples contain components of unique sequence but identical base composition. At the first stage of mass spectrometry, these sequence isomers cannot be differentiated and would appear as doublets rather than singlets. However, underlying sequence differences should be detectable by collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID MS/MS), as y-type product ions will retain the original enzymatically incorporated isotope label. Here, we determine appropriate instrumental conditions that enable CID MS/MS of isotopically labeled ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) digestion products such that the original isotope label is maintained in the product ion mass spectrum. Next, we demonstrate how y-type product ions can be used to differentiate singlets and doublets from isomer sequences. We were then able to extend the utility of this approach by using CID MS/MS for the confirmation of an expected RNase T1 digestion product within the CARD analysis of an Escherichia coli mutant strain even in the presence of interfering and overlapping digestion products from other transfer RNAs."

However, structures with known function represent only a fraction of the secondary structure reported for HIV-1(NL4-3). One tool to assess the importance of RNA structures is to examine their conservation over evolutionary time. To this end, we used SHAPE to model the secondary structure of a second primate lentiviral genome, SIVmac239, which shares only 50% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with HIV-1NL4-3. Only about half of the paired nucleotides are paired in both genomic RNAs and, across the genome, just 71 base pairs form with the same pairing partner in both genomes. On average the RNA secondary structure is thus evolving at a much faster rate than the sequence. Structure at the Gag-Pro-Pol frameshift site is maintained but in a significantly altered form, while the impact of selection for maintaining a protein binding interaction can be seen in the conservation of pairing partners in the small RRE stems where Rev binds. Structures that are conserved between SIVmac239 and HIV-1(NL4-3) also occur at the 5' polyadenylation sequence, in the plus strand primer sites, PPT and cPPT, and in the stem-loop structure that includes the first splice acceptor site. The two genomes are adenosine-rich and cytidine-poor. The structured regions are enriched in guanosines, while unpaired regions are enriched in adenosines, and functionaly important structures have stronger base pairing than nonconserved structures. We conclude that much of the secondary structure is the result of fortuitous pairing in a metastable state that reforms during sequence evolution. However, secondary structure elements with important function are stabilized by higher guanosine content that allows regions of structure to persist as sequence evolution proceeds, and, within the confines of selective pressure, allows structures to evolve."

The species also has the ability to form interspecific hybrids with the human parasite S. haematobium with natural hybridisation observed in West Africa, presenting possible zoonotic transmission. Additionally, this exchange of alleles between species may dramatically influence disease dynamics and parasite evolution. We have generated a 374 Mb assembly of the S. bovis genome using Illumina and PacBio-based technologies. Despite infecting different hosts and organs, the genome sequences of S. bovis and S. haematobium appeared strikingly similar with 97% sequence identity. The two species share 98% of protein-coding genes, with an average sequence identity of 97.3% at the amino acid level. Genome comparison identified large continuous parts of the genome (up to several 100 kb) showing almost 100% sequence identity between S. bovis and S. haematobium. It is unlikely that this is a result of genome conservation and provides further evidence of natural interspecific hybridization between S. bovis and S. haematobium. Our results suggest that foreign DNA obtained by interspecific hybridization was maintained in the population through multiple meiosis cycles and that hybrids were sexually reproductive, producing viable offspring. The S. bovis genome assembly forms a highly valuable resource for studying schistosome evolution and exploring genetic regions that are associated with species-specific phenotypic traits."

A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction with deep mutational scanning to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms. We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events."

The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping. The genome contains five putative promoter-like sequences showing similarity to the host promoter consensus sequence and allowing for a 2-bp mismatch. In addition, ten putative rho-independent terminators were detected. Because the genome sequence shows essentially no similarity to any previously characterised bacteriophage, TP-84 should be considered a new species in an undefined genus within the Siphoviridae family. Thus a taxonomic proposal of a new Tp84virus genus has been accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The bioinformatics genome analysis was verified by confirmation of 33 TP-84 proteins, which included: a) cloning of a selected CDS in Escherichia coli, coding for a DNA single-stranded binding protein (SSB; gene TP84_63), b) purification and functional assays of the recombinant TP-84 SSB, which has been shown to improve PCR reactions, c) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of TP-84 bacteriophage capsid proteins, d) purification of TP-84 endolysin activity, e) MS analysis of the host cells from infection time course."

The mechanical behavior of DNA under torsional stress has been studied on a mesoscopic scale, but little is known concerning its response at the level of individual base pairs and the effects of base pair composition. To answer this question, we have developed a geometrical restraint that can accurately control the total twist of a DNA segment during all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. By applying this restraint to four different DNA oligomers, we are able to show that DNA responds to both under- and overtwisting in a very heterogeneous manner. Certain base pair steps, in specific sequence environments, are able to absorb most of the torsional stress, leaving other steps close to their relaxed conformation. This heterogeneity also affects the local torsional modulus of DNA. These findings suggest that modifying torsional stress on DNA could act as a modulator for protein binding via the heterogeneous changes in local DNA structure."

Different genotypes of T. gondii result in different lesions in the same host. T. gondii rhoptry protein 8 (TgROP8) is a major factor of T. gondii acute virulence. We examined sequence variation in the TgROP8 gene among T. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical localities. The TgROP8 gene was amplified from individual isolates and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood based on the sequences obtained plus TgME49 from the ToxoDB database. The TgROP8 gene was 1728 bp in length for all the examined T. gondii strains, and their A+T contents were 45.37-45.95%. Sequence analysis detected 140 (0.06-5.56%) variable nucleotide positions resulting in 96 (0-10.78%) amino acid substitutions. Sequence variations in the TgROP8 gene resulted in polymorphic restriction sites for endonucleases BstBI, BsaI, and XhoI, which allowed the differentiation of the three classical genotype strains (types I, II, and III) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). However, phylogenetic analyses indicated that the TgROP8 gene is not a suitable genetic marker for population studies of T. gondii. "

The anti-mitotic, toxic, and carcinogenic action of PAs is thought to be caused, at least in part, by these cross-links. We wished to determine whether the activated PA pyrrole dehydromonocrotaline (DHMO) exhibits base sequence preferences when cross-linked to a set of model duplex poly A-T 14-mer oligonucleotides with varying internal and/or end 5'-d(CG), 5'-d(GC), 5'-d(TA), 5'-d(CGCG), or 5'-d(GCGC) sequences. DHMO-DNA cross-links were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of 32P endlabeled oligonucleotides and by HPLC analysis of cross-linked DNAs enzymatically digested to their constituent deoxynucleosides. The degree of DNA cross-links depended upon the concentration of the pyrrole, but not on the base sequence of the oligonucleotide target. Likewise, HPLC chromatograms of cross-linked and digested DNAs showed no discernible sequence preference for any nucleotide. Added glutathione, tyrosine, cysteine, and aspartic acid, but not phenylalanine, threonine, serine, lysine, or methionine competed with DNA as alternate nucleophiles for cross-linking by DHMO. From these data it appears that DHMO exhibits no strong base preference when forming cross-links with DNA, and that some cellular nucleophiles can inhibit DNA cross-link formation."

The subfamily Chordopoxvirinae contains viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrates including marine mammals within the Balaenidae, Delphinidae, Mustelidae, Odobenidae, Otariidae, Phocidae, and Phocoenidae families. Recently, a novel poxvirus was found in a northern sea otter pup (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) that stranded in Alaska in 2009. The phylogenetic relationships of marine mammal poxviruses are not well established because of the lack of complete genome sequences. The current study sequenced the entire sea otterpox virus Enhydra lutris kenyoni (SOPV-ELK) genome using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The SOPV-ELK genome is the smallest poxvirus genome known at 127,879 bp, is 68.7% A+T content, is predicted to encode 132 proteins, and has 2546 bp inverted terminal repeats at each end. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenated amino acid sequences of 7 chorodopoxvirus core genes revealed the SOPV-ELK is 52.5-74.1% divergent from other known chordopoxviruses and is most similar to pteropoxvirus from Australia (PTPV-Aus). SOPV-ELK represents a new chordopoxvirus species and may belong to a novel genus. SOPV-ELK encodes eight unique genes. While the function of six predicted genes remains unknown, two genes appear to function as novel immune-modulators. SOPV-ELK-003 appears to encode a novel interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP), based on limited sequence and structural similarity to other poxviral IL-18 BPs. SOPV-ELK-035 appears to encode a novel tumor necrosis factor receptor-like (TNFR) protein that may be associated with the depression of the host's antiviral response. Additionally, SOPV-ELK-036 encodes a tumor necrosis factor-like apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein that has previously only been found in PTPV-Aus. The SOPV-ELK genome is the first mustelid poxvirus and only the second poxvirus from a marine mammal to be fully sequenced. Sequencing of the SOPV-ELK genome is an important step in unraveling the position of marine mammal poxviruses within the larger Poxviridae phylogenetic tree and provides the necessary sequence to develop molecular tools for future diagnostics and epidemiological studies."

Conspicuous presences of some of them as biomarkers for cancers, aging etc. are well reported. Biogenesis of circular RNA competes with Pre-mRNA splicing using the same splicing machinery and gene loci. Also, some circular RNAs are reported to have open reading frames and internal ribosome entry site for ribosome binding, which increases the chance of overlapping features among circular and mRNA transcripts. Therefore, discriminating the Exonic circular RNAs and mRNAs solely through sequence properties is challenging. However, possible discriminating factors, such as, reports on non-canonical arrangement of exons in circular RNAs were cited. This study was dedicated to classify Circular RNAs from mRNAs by recruiting features extracted from sequences as well as predicted secondary structures and ANN classifier models for all these feature types. The features were statistics of di-nucleotide index, emission probability of RNA sequences and entropy of di-nucleotides. Finally a simple decision voting was applied to combine decisions obtained from multiple classifiers. After performing 10 fold cross validation we obtained average values of efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and Mathews correlation coefficient as 0.8374, 0.8544, 0.8203 and 0.6753 respectively. In the backdrop of few reports of identification of circular RNAs from constitutive exons and other long non-coding RNAs, this is the first report of discriminating exonic circular RNAs from mRNAs using sequence and sequence-derived properties."

With undamaged templating purines polymerase iota normally favors Hoogsteen base pairing. Polymerase iota can incorporate nucleotides opposite a benzo[a]pyrene-derived adenine lesion (dA*); while mainly error-free, the identity of misincorporated bases is influenced by local sequence context. We performed molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structural basis for lesion bypass. Our results suggest that hydrogen bonds between the benzo[a]pyrenyl moiety and nearby bases limit the movement of the templating base to maintain the anti glycosidic bond conformation in the binary complex in a 5'-CAGA*TT-3' sequence. This facilitates correct incorporation of dT via a Watson-Crick pair. In a 5'-TTTA*GA-3' sequence the lesion does not form these hydrogen bonds, permitting dA* to rotate around the glycosidic bond to syn and incorporate dT via a Hoogsteen pair. With syn dA*, there is also an opportunity for increased misincorporation of dGTP. These results expand our understanding of the versatility and flexibility of polymerase iota and its lesion bypass functions in humans."

Two recombinant vectors IFNβ(K) and IFNβ(K+CRID )were designed by site-directed mutagenesis. The IFNβ(K) and IFNβ(K+CRID) have two substitutions in Kozak sequence and four substitutions in CRID sequence, respectively. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell codon usage optimization was also performed for both of them.

The results of this study indicate that the amount of IFNβ protein produced by CHO cells containing IFNβ(K) has been elevated up to 3.5-fold. On the other hand, enormous amounts of IFNβ mRNA and protein were produced by cells containing IFNβ(K+CRID) construct; more than 4.6-fold and 6-fold, respectively.

However, it is not known how base-sequences affect the local solvation of ligand inside minor-grooves of DNA. Here we present a comprehensive study on sequence-dependent solvation dynamics of ligand inside duplex-DNA by measuring the static and dynamic fluorescence Stokes shifts of a popular groove-binder, DAPI, inside DNA minor-grooves created by four different sequences; d(5'-CGCGAATTCGCG-3')2, d(5'-CGCGTTAACGCG-3')2, d(5'-CGCGCAATTGCGCG-3')2, and d(5'-CGCGCTTAAGCGCG-3')2, having different sequences near DAPI-binding site. Fluorescence up-conversion and time-correlated single photon counting techniques are employed to capture the dynamic Stokes shifts of DAPI over five decades in time from 100 fs to 10 ns. We show that the ligands sense different static and dynamic solvation inside minor-grooves created by different sequences: Only subtle change in the dynamics is seen in DNA containing -AATTG-, -TTAAG-, and -AATTC- sequences, which show power-law relaxation in initial time-decades, followed by biexponential decay in nanosecond time-scales. However, changing a single base (and the complementary base) near ligand-binding site from -TTAAG- to -TTAAC- drastically induces the dynamics to follow a single power-law relaxation over the entire five decades. The observed variation of dynamics possibly relate to the local DNA motions, coupled to the hydration dynamics near the ligand-binding site. "

In such an assembly scenario, multiple secondary structural elements from within the RNA, termed ""packaging signals"" (PS), contact coat proteins and facilitate efficient capsid assembly. In this work, the assembly model is extended to incorporate explicit nucleotide sequence information as well as simple aspects of RNA folding that would be occurring during the RNA/capsid coassembly process. Applying this paradigm to a dodecahedral viral capsid, a computer-derived nucleotide sequence is evolved de novo that is optimal for packaging the RNA into capsids, while also containing capacity for coding for a viral protein. Analysis of the effects of mutations on the ability of the RNA sequence to successfully package into a viral capsid reveals a complex fitness landscape where the majority of mutations are neutral with respect to packaging efficiency with a small number of mutations resulting in a near-complete loss of RNA packaging. Moreover, the model shows how attempts to ablate PSs in the viral RNA sequence may result in redundant PSs already present in the genome fulfilling their packaging role. This explains why recent experiments that attempt to ablate putative PSs may not see an effect on packaging. This modeling framework presents an example of how an implicit mapping can be made from genotype to a fitness parameter important for viral biology, i.e., viral capsid yield, with potential applications to theoretical models of viral evolution."
