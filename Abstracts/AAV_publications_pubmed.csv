In this regard, the discovery of assembly-activating protein (AAP) sheds new light on this crucial part of AAV biology and vector production. Previous studies have shown that AAP is essential for assembly; however, how its mechanistic roles in assembly might differ among AAV serotypes remains uncharacterized. Here, we show that biological properties of AAPs and capsid assembly processes are surprisingly distinct among AAV serotypes 1 to 12. In the study, we investigated subcellular localizations and assembly-promoting functions of AAP1 to -12 (i.e., AAPs derived from AAV1 to -12, respectively) and examined the AAP dependence of capsid assembly processes of these 12 serotypes using combinatorial approaches that involved immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, barcode-Seq (i. e., a high-throughput quantitative method using DNA barcodes and a next-generation sequencing technology), and quantitative dot blot assays. This study revealed that AAP1 to -12 are all localized in the nucleus with serotype-specific differential patterns of nucleolar association; AAPs and assembled capsids do not necessarily colocalize; AAPs are promiscuous in promoting capsid assembly of other serotypes, with the exception of AAP4, -5, -11, and -12; assembled AAV5, -8, and -9 capsids are excluded from the nucleolus, in contrast to the nucleolar enrichment of assembled AAV2 capsids; and, surprisingly, AAV4, -5, and -11 capsids are not dependent on AAP for assembly. These observations highlight the serotype-dependent heterogeneity of the capsid assembly process and challenge current notions about the role of AAP and the nucleolus in capsid assembly."

Roughly 11% of the blood donors had mixed AAV infections. AAV prevalence was dramatically increased in immunosuppressed patients, 76% of whom were AAV positive. Of these, at least 45% displayed mixed infections.

In this review, we focus on adeno-associated virus (AAV). Over the last few decades, AAV has become a leading choice for safe gene delivery, in part due to its replication deficiency in cells without a helper virus.

To determine whether PEPCK-M had a causative role in modulating the skeletal muscle growth response to Ractopamine, we used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to over-express Pck2 (AAV-Pck2) in murine skeletal muscle. A contralateral limb design was employed, such that each mouse served as its own control (injected with a GFP-only expressing AAV1, labelled AAV-GFP). Daily injections of Clenbuterol (1 mg/kg for 21 days) or vehicle control were also carried out to assess the effects of AAV-Pck2 overexpression on the anabolic response to a beta-adrenergic agonist. AAV-Pck2 overexpression in leg muscles of male C57BL6/J mice for 4 weeks (6-10 weeks of age) increased Pck2 mRNA (~100-fold), protein (not quantifiable) and enzyme activity (~3-fold). There was a trend (p = 0.0798) for AAV-Pck2 overexpression to reduce TA muscle weights, but there was no significant effect on muscle fibre diameters or myosin heavy chain isoform (MyHC) mRNA expression. When skeletal muscle growth was induced by daily administration of Clenbuterol (for 21 days), overexpression of AAV-Pck2 had no effect on the growth response, nor did it alter the expression of Phosphoserine Aminotransferase-1 (Psat1) or Asparagine Synthetase (Asns) mRNA or the Clenbuterol-induced decreases in MyHC IIa and IIx mRNA expression (p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0267 respectively). However AAV-Pck2 overexpression reduced TA muscle weights (p = 0.0434), particularly in the Control (vehicle treated) mice (p = 0.059 for AAV x Clenbuterol interaction) and increased the expression of Seryl-tRNA Synthetase (Sars) mRNA (p = 0.0477).

In the latter respect, the recent discovery of a non-structural AAV protein, termed assembly-activating protein (AAP), has shed new light on the processes involved in assembly of the viral capsid VP proteins into a capsid. Although many AAV serotypes require AAP for assembly, we have recently reported that AAV4, 5, and 11 are exceptions to this rule. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AAPs and assembled capsids of different serotypes localize to different subcellular compartments. This unexpected heterogeneity in the biological properties and functional roles of AAPs among different AAV serotypes underscores the importance of studies on AAPs derived from diverse serotypes. This manuscript details a straightforward dot blot assay for AAV quantitation and its application to assess AAP dependency and serotype specificity in capsid assembly. To demonstrate the utility of this dot blot assay, we set out to characterize capsid assembly and AAP dependency of Snake AAV, a previously uncharacterized reptile AAV, as well as AAV5 and AAV9, which have previously been shown to be AAP-independent and AAP-dependent serotypes, respectively. The assay revealed that Snake AAV capsid assembly requires Snake AAP and cannot be promoted by AAPs from AAV5 and AAV9. The assay also showed that, unlike many of the common serotype AAPs that promote heterologous capsid assembly by cross-complementation, Snake AAP does not promote assembly of AAV9 capsids. In addition, we show that the choice of nuclease significantly affects the readout of the dot blot assay, and thus, choosing an optimal enzyme is critical for successful assessment of AAV titers."

Concurrently, it raised questions about the role of AAP during production of recombinant vectors based on natural or molecularly engineered AAV capsids. Here, we show that AAP is indeed essential for generation of functional recombinant AAV2 vectors in both mammalian and insect cell-based vector production systems. Surprisingly, we observed that AAV2 capsid proteins VP1 to -3 are unstable in the absence of AAP2, likely due to rapid proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase of intracellular VP1 to -3 but neither triggered assembly of functional capsids nor promoted nuclear localization of the capsid proteins. Together, this underscores the crucial and unique role of AAP in the AAV life cycle, where it rapidly chaperones capsid assembly, thus preventing degradation of free capsid proteins. An expanded analysis comprising nine alternative AAV serotypes (1, 3 to 9, and rh10) showed that vector production always depends on the presence of AAP, with the exceptions of AAV4 and AAV5, which exhibited AAP-independent, albeit low-level, particle assembly. Interestingly, AAPs from all 10 serotypes could cross-complement AAP-depleted helper plasmids during vector production, despite there being distinct intracellular AAP localization patterns. These were most pronounced for AAP4 and AAP5, congruent with their inability to rescue an AAV2/AAP2 knockout. We conclude that AAP is key for assembly of genuine capsids from at least 10 different AAV serotypes, which has implications for vectors derived from wild-type or synthetic AAV capsids."

This is the first comprehensive Illumina-based RNA-Seq analysis of small RNAs expressed by AAV alone or upon co-infection with helper adenovirus or HSV. Several hotspots of AAV-specific small RNAs were detected mostly close to or within the AAV-ITR and apparently transcribed from the newly identified anti-p5 promoter. An additional small RNA hotspot was located downstream of the p40 promoter, from where transcription of non-coding RNAs associated with the inhibition of adenovirus replication were recently described. Parallel detection of known Ad and HSV miRNAs indirectly validated the newly identified small AAV RNA species. The predominant small RNAs were analyzed on Northern blots and by human argonaute protein-mediated co-immunoprecipitation. None of the small AAV RNAs showed characteristics of bona fide miRNAs, but characteristics of alternative RNA processing indicative of differentially regulated AAV promoter-associated small RNAs. Furthermore, the AAV-induced regulation of cellular miRNA levels was analyzed at different time points post infection. In contrast to other virus groups AAV infection had virtually no effect on the expression of cellular miRNA, which underscores the long-established concept that wild-type AAV infection is apathogenic.

Adeno-associated virus receptor (AAVR) (also named KIAA0319L) is an essential cellular receptor required for the transduction of vectors derived from multiple AAV serotypes, including the evolutionarily distant serotypes AAV2 and AAV5. Here, we further biochemically characterize the AAV-AAVR interaction and define the domains within the ectodomain of AAVR that facilitate this interaction. By using a virus overlay assay, it was previously shown that the major AAV2 binding protein in membrane preparations of human cells corresponds to a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. By establishing a purification procedure, performing further protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and utilizing mass spectrometry, we now show that this glycoprotein is identical to AAVR. While we find that AAVR is an N-linked glycosylated protein, this glycosylation is not a strict requirement for AAV2 binding or functional transduction. Using a combination of genetic complementation with deletion constructs and virus overlay assays with individual domains, we find that AAV2 functionally interacts predominantly with the second Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) repeat domain (PKD2) present in the ectodomain of AAVR. In contrast, AAV5 interacts primarily through the first, most membrane-distal, PKD domain (PKD1) of AAVR to promote transduction. Furthermore, other AAV serotypes, including AAV1 and -8, require a combination of PKD1 and PKD2 for optimal transduction. These results suggest that despite their shared dependence on AAVR as a critical entry receptor, different AAV serotypes have evolved distinctive interactions with the same receptor."

Here, we utilize a novel CRISPR screen to identify AAV restriction factors in a human hepatocyte cell line. The major hit from our gain-of-function screen is the apical polarity determinant Crumbs 3 (Crb3). Knockout (KO) of Crb3 enhances AAV transduction, while overexpression exerts the opposite effect. Further, Crb3 appears to restrict AAV transduction in a serotype- and cell type-specific manner. Particularly, for AAV serotype 9 and a rationally engineered AAV variant, we demonstrate that increased availability of galactosylated glycans on the surfaces of Crb3 KO cells, but not the universal AAV receptor, leads to increased capsid attachment and enhanced transduction. We postulate that Crb3 could serve as a key molecular determinant that restricts the availability of AAV glycan attachment factors on the cell surface by maintaining apical-basal polarity and tight junction integrity."

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for αAAV-IgG, significantly higher seroprevalence was observed for AAV1 and AAVrh74 in 2- to 7-year-old MPS III patients than in healthy controls.

To accomplish this, we isolated a monoclonal antibody against AAV9 following immunization of BALB/c mice and hybridoma screening. This antibody, PAV9.1, is specific for intact AAV9 capsids and has a high neutralizing titer of >1:160,000. We used cryo-electron microscopy to reconstruct PAV9.1 in complex with AAV9. We then mapped its epitope to the 3-fold axis of symmetry on the capsid, specifically to residues 496-NNN-498 and 588-QAQAQT-592.

Here, the lingering question is additionally addressed of whether molecular AAV evolution via DNA family shuffling of viral capsid genes would perturb AAP functionality due to concurrent and inadvertent recombination of the AAP open reading frame. To this end, a battery of complementary experiments was conducted in which: (1) the ability of chimeric AAP from AAVDJ, a hybrid of serotypes 2, 8, and 9, was tested to rescue AAP knockouts in the three parental serotypes; (2) the functionality of 60 chimeric AAPs extracted from five shuffled, unselected capsid libraries was measured; (3) whether production of different shuffled libraries, 10 wild-type serotypes or 25 individual chimeric capsids, can be enhanced by overexpression of AAP cocktails was assessed; and (4) the activity of 12 chimeric AAPs isolated from a shuffled library that was iteratively selected in vivo in mouse livers was studied. Collectively, the data demonstrate a remarkable tolerance of AAP for recombination via DNA family shuffling, evidenced by the findings that (1) all chimeric AAPs studied here retained at least partial activity, even in cases where the cognate hybrid capsid may be non-functional, and that (2) ectopic AAP overexpression did not enhance production of shuffled AAV chimeras or libraries, implying that the inherently encoded hybrid AAP variants are sufficiently active. Together, this work provides compelling evidence that AAP is not rate limiting during AAV capsid shuffling and thereby relieves a major concern in the field of AAV vector evolution."

In viral gene therapy, the surface of the capsid is an important determinant of tissue tropism, impacts gene transfer efficiency, and is targeted by the human immune system. Preexisting immunity is a significant challenge to this approach, and the ability to visualize areas of antibody binding (""footprints"") can inform efforts to improve the efficacy of viral vectors. Atomic resolution, smaller proteins, and asymmetric structures are the goals to attain in cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction (cryo-EM) as of late. The versatility of the technique and the ability to vitrify a wide range of heterogeneous molecules in solution allow structural biologists to characterize a variety of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions at lower resolution. Cryo-EM has served as an important means to study key surface areas of the AAV gene delivery vehicle-specifically, those involved with binding neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) [2-4]. This method offers a unique opportunity for visualizing antibody binding ""hotspots"" on the surface of these and other viral vectors. When combined with mutagenesis, one can eliminate these hotspots to create viral vectors with the ability to avoid preexisting host immune recognition during gene delivery and genetic defect correction in disease treatment.

However, AAV vectors do have a limitation in their packaging capacity, being capable of holding no more than ~5kb of DNA and in a therapeutic transgene scenario, this length of DNA would need to include genetic control elements in addition to the gene coding sequence (CDS) of interest. Given that numerous diseases are caused by mutations in genes with a CDS exceeding 3.5kb, this makes packaging into a single AAV capsid not possible for larger genes. Due to this problem, yet with the desire to use AAV vectors, research groups have adapted the standard AAV gene therapy approach to enable delivery of such large genes to target cells using dual AAV vector systems. Here we review the AAV dual vector strategies currently employed and highlight the virtues and drawbacks of each method plus the likelihood of success with such approaches."

One of the most promising and enduring vectors is the AAV, which has been shown to be safe. In particular, several clinical trials have been conducted with AAV serotype 2. All of them detected viral genomes, but identification of mRNA transduction was not consistent; clinical outcomes in Phase II studies were also inconsistent. The lack of a positive outcome has been attributed to a less-than-efficient viral infection by AAV2, a weak transgene promoter and the host immune response to the vector. Areas covered: Herein, the authors focus on AAV gene therapy for CF, evaluating past experience with this approach and identifying ways forward, based on the progress that has already been made in identifying and overcoming the limitations of AAV gene therapy. Expert opinion: Such progress makes it clear that this is an opportune time to push forward toward the development of a gene therapy for CF. Drugs to treat the basic defect in CF represent a remarkable advance but cannot treat a significant cohort of patients with rare mutations. Thus, there is a critical need to develop a gene therapy for those individuals."

More recently, replication of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5)/AAV serotype 2 (AAV-2) hybrid vectors was shown to be inhibited incisby a sequence near the 3' end of AAVrep, termed the Rep inhibition sequence for adenoviral replication (RIS-Ad). RIS-Ad functions independently of Rep protein expression. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of adenoviral replication by RIS-Ad requires an active AAV p40 promoter and the 5' half of the intron. In addition, Ad inhibition is critically dependent on the integrity of the p40 transcription start site (TSS) leading to short p40-associated transcripts. These do not give rise to effector molecules capable of inhibiting adenoviral replication intrans, like small polypeptides or microRNAs. Our data point to an inhibitory mechanism in which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses directly downstream of the p40 promoter, leading to interference of the stalled Pol II transcription complex with the adenoviral replication machinery. Whereas inhibition by RIS-Ad is mediated exclusively incis, it can be overcome by providing a replication-competent adenoviral genome intrans Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RIS-Ad is not limited to AAV-2 but could also be shown for the corresponding regions of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-5.

Here, we apply Illumina-based RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the entire AAV2 transcriptome in the absence or presence of Ad.

In this report, we have characterized the defect in 6 additional capsid mutants located in a region ∼30 Å in diameter on the surface of the AAV type 2 (AAV2) capsid near the 2-fold interface. These mutants, which are highly conserved among primate serotypes, displayed a severe defect (3 to 6 logs) in infectivity. All of the mutants accumulated significant levels of uncoated DNA in the nucleus, but none of the mutants were able to accumulate significant amounts of genomic mRNA postinfection. In addition, wild-type (wt) capsids that were bound to the conformational antibody A20, which is known to bind the capsid surface in the region of the mutants, were also defective for transcription. In all cases, the mutant virus particles, as well as the antibody-bound wild-type capsids, were able to enter the cell, travel to the nucleus, uncoat, and synthesize a second strand but were unable to transcribe their genomes. Taken together, the phenotype of these mutants provides compelling evidence that the AAV capsid plays a role in the transcription of its genome, and the mutants map this functional region on the surface of the capsid near the 2-fold interface. This appears to be the first example of a viral structural protein that is also involved in the transcription of the viral genome that it delivers to the nucleus."

When a low dose of AAV9 was injected into mice treated with dexamethasone, global transduction and vector biodistribution were not significantly different in most tissues, other than the liver and the heart, when compared to control mice. When AAV9 vectors were used at a high dose, both the transgene expression and the AAV vector genome copy number were significantly decreased in the majority of murine tissues. However, no effect on global transduction was observed when dexamethasone was administered 2 h after AAV vector injection. The study on the kinetics of AAV virus clearance demonstrated that dexamethasone slowed down the clearance of AAV9 in the blood after systemic application. The mechanism study showed that dexamethasone inhibited the enhancement of AAV9 vascular permeability mediated by serum proteins. The findings indicate that dexamethasone is able to inhibit the vascular permeability of AAV and compromise the therapeutic effect after systemic administration of AAV vector.

Data on such post-translational modifications in the capsid of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotypes (AAV1-rh10) is limited. We have employed liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis to characterize post-translational modifications in AAV1-rh10 capsid protein.

About 82% of these post-translational modifications are novel. A limited validation of AAV2 capsids by MALDI-TOF and western blot analysis demonstrated minimal glycosylation and ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids. To further validate this, we disrupted a glycosylation site identified in AAV2 capsid (AAV2-N253Q), which severely compromised its packaging efficiency (~ 100-fold vs. AAV2 wild-type vectors). In order to confirm other post-translational modifications detected such as SUMOylation, mutagenesis of a SUMOylation site(K258Q) in AAV2 was performed. This mutant vector demonstrated reduced levels of SUMO-1/2/3 proteins and negligible transduction, 2 weeks after ocular gene transfer.

To this end, we have developed a protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that responds to elevated extracellular protease activity commonly found in diseased tissue microenvironments. The AAV9-based provector is initially inactive, but then it can be switched on by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9. Cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction reveal that the provector capsid is structurally similar to that of AAV9, with a flexible peptide insertion at the top of the 3-fold protrusions. In an in vivo model of myocardial infarction (MI), the provector is able to deliver transgenes site specifically to high-MMP-activity regions of the damaged heart, with concomitant decreased delivery to many off-target organs, including the liver.

To do this, any serotype dependent steps need to be removed from the process. The harvest and initial capture steps that can satisfy all of the needs of a platform AAV process is the use of low pH and Triton in the harvest, followed by filtration and cation exchange chromatography (CEX) for initial capture. The low pH hydrolyses and removes the host cell DNA, a difficult contaminate to remove. CEX then provides a concentration and capture step.

A systemic administration of AAV vectors has been proposed in order to achieve global transduction, which requires that the AAV vector is capable of crossing the blood vessels. It has been demonstrated that serum proteins are able to directly interact with AAV virions to enhance liver transduction. In this study, we investigate whether the serum proteins have the potential to increase the capacity of AAV to diffuse through the endothelial cells and deliver the transgene into the whole body. First, we found that the direct interaction of serum with AAV9 virions increased the epithelial cell permeability of AAV9 in vitro. Several serum proteins with a potential effect on AAV vascular permeability have been identified from mass spectrometry analysis, including fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), platelet factor 4, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and plasminogen. The incubation of these serum proteins with AAV9 enhanced the global transduction in mice after a systemic administration. To apply these findings in clinical practice, we demonstrated that the clinical product cryoprecipitate (mainly containing fibrinogen and vWF) augmented AAV9 global transduction. The mechanism study revealed that cryoprecipitate slowed down the clearance of AAV9 vectors in the blood so that the AAV9 vectors had sufficient time to travel to the peripheral organs. In summary, the results from this study suggests that serum proteins interact with AAV virions and enhance the AAV9 vascular permeability for global transduction, and, more importantly, cryoprecipitate can be immediately applied for clinical patients who need the systemic administration of AAV vectors for global transduction."

One week after viral injection into the submucosa of the tongue, EGFP expression in fungiform taste cells was observed only in animals injected with AAV-DJ, a synthetic serotype. Next, time course of AAV-DJ-mediated EGFP expression in fungiform taste cells was evaluated. Intragemmal EGFP signals appeared after a delay, rapidly increased until 7 days postinjection, and gradually decreased over the next few weeks probably because of the cell turnover. Finally, the taste cell types susceptible to AAV-DJ transduction were characterized. EGFP expression was observed in PLCβ2-immunoreactive type II and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-immunoreactive type III taste cells as well as in cells immunonegative for both PLCβ2 and AADC, demonstrating that AAV-DJ does not discriminate functional taste cell types. In conclusion, the method established in this study will be a promising tool to study the mechanism of taste."

A major goal is to enhance the transduction efficiency of vectors in order to achieve therapeutic levels of gene expression at a vector dose that is below the immunological response threshold. In an attempt to identify novel compounds that enhance rAAV transduction, we performed two high-throughput screens comprising 2,396 compounds. We identified 13 compounds that were capable of enhancing transduction, of which 12 demonstrated vector-specific effects and 1 could also enhance vector-independent transgene expression. Many of these compounds had similar properties and could be categorized into five groups: epipodophyllotoxins (group 1), inducers of DNA damage (group 2), effectors of epigenetic modification (group 3), anthracyclines (group 4), and proteasome inhibitors (group 5). We optimized dosing for the identified compounds in several immortalized human cell lines as well as normal diploid cells. We found that the group 1 epipodophyllotoxins (teniposide and etoposide) consistently produced the greatest transduction enhancement. We also explored transduction enhancement among single-stranded, self-complementary, and fragment vectors and found that the compounds could impact fragmented rAAV2 transduction to an even greater extent than single-stranded vectors. In vivo analysis of rAAV2 and all of the clinically relevant compounds revealed that, consistent with our in vitro results, teniposide exhibited the greatest level of transduction enhancement. Finally, we explored the capability of teniposide to enhance transduction of fragment vectors in vivo using an AAV8 capsid that is known to exhibit robust liver tropism. Consistent with our in vitro results, teniposide coadministration greatly enhanced fragmented rAAV8 transduction at 48 h and 8 days. This study provides a foundation based on the rAAV small-molecule screen methodology, which is ideally used for more-diverse libraries of compounds that can be tested for potentiating rAAV transduction."

Specifically, we generated truncated viral capsid subunits that, when combined with native capsid components into mosaic capsids, can perform robust activatable peptide display. By modulating the ratio of subunits in the mosaic capsid, properties of the activatable peptide display function can be optimized. Interestingly, the truncated subunits can form homomeric capsids not observed in nature, but at the price of losing the ability to carry out activatable peptide display. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of capsid mosaicism when activatable peptide display is desired and help explain why the wild-type AAV capsid exists as a mosaic of different subunits. This proof-of-concept study illustrates a strategy for reprogramming a particular conformational output behavior of AAV in pursuit of the long-term vision of creating stimulus-responsive nanodevices."

This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after propagating a field isolate of the DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The full genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared to other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of the structural and non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other Dependoparvovirus family members.

However, the installation of such capsid modifications currently faces two major challenges: (1) The complex and delicate capsid proteins often do not tolerate large modifications, and (2) capsid proteins are composed of the 20 canonical amino acids, precluding site-specific chemical modification of the virus. Here, we describe a technology for generating adeno-associated virus (AAV) while incorporating an unnatural amino acid (UAA) into specific sites of the virus capsid. Incorporation of this UAA is generally tolerated well, presumably due to its small structural footprint. The resulting virus can be precisely functionalized at the site of UAA incorporation using chemoselective conjugation strategies targeted toward the azido side chain of this UAA. This technology provides a powerful way to modify AAV with unprecedented precision to both probe and engineer its entry process."

Such model systems are powerful tools to study the virus biology and in particular for the identification and characterization of host factors playing a role in the viral infection cycle. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are heavily studied due to their use as gene delivery vectors. AAV relies on other helper viruses for successful replication and on host factors for several aspects of the viral life cycle. However the role of host and helper viral factors is only partially known. Production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors for gene delivery applications depends on knowledge of AAV biology and the limited understanding of host and helper viral factors may be precluding efficient production, particularly in heterologous systems. Model systems in simpler eukaryotes like the yeast S. cerevisiae would be useful tools to identify and study the role of host factors in AAV biology. Here we show that expression of AAV2 viral proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, AAP, Rep78, Rep52 and an ITR-flanked DNA in yeast leads to capsid formation, DNA replication and encapsidation, resulting in formation of infectious particles. Many of the AAV characteristics observed in yeast resemble those in other systems, making it a suitable model system. Future findings in the yeast system could be translatable to other AAV host systems and aid in more efficient production of rAAV vectors."

Since AAV vectors do not possess an integrase activity, application is restricted to terminally differentiated tissues if transgene expression is required long term. To overcome this limitation and to generate AAV vectors that persist episomally in dividing cells, AAV vector genomes were equipped with a scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR). After a mild antibiotic selection, cells transduced with AAV-S/MAR established colonies that maintained long-term transgene expression (>50 population doublings) from replicating AAV vector episomes in the absence of further selection. Unexpectedly, with a lesser but still significant efficiency, the control vector (AAV-ΔS/MAR), a standard single-stranded AAV vector, also established stable transgene-expressing colonies, most of which were maintained as replicating episomes rather than integrated vector genomes. Thus, based on the result in HeLa cells, it is concluded that AAV vector genomes per se possess the ability to establish episomal maintenance in proliferating cells, a feature that can be enhanced by incorporation of a foreign genomic element such as an S/MAR element."

Exploration of effective strategies to enhance AAV transduction and escape from Nab activity is still imperative. Previous studies have shown the compatibility of capsids from AAV serotypes and homology of recognition sites of AAV Nab located on different capsid subunits from one virion. In this study, we co-transfected AAV2 and AAV8 helper plasmids at different ratios (3:1, 1:1 and 1:3) to assemble haploid capsids and study both their transduction efficiency and Nab escape activity. After muscular injection, all of the haploid viruses induced higher transduction than their parental AAV vectors (2- to 9-fold over AAV2), with the highest of these being the haploid vector AAV2/8 3:1. After systemic administration, a 4-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with haploid AAV2/8 1:3 than that with AAV8 alone. We then packaged the therapeutic factor IX cassette into haploid AAV2/8 1:3 capsids and injected them into FIX knockout mice via the tail vein. Higher FIX expression and improved phenotypic correction were achieved with the haploid AAV2/8 1:3 virus vector when compared to that of AAV8. Additionally, the haploid virus AAV2/8 1:3 was able to escape AAV2 neutralization and did not increase capsid antigen presentation capacity when compared to AAV8. To improve the Nab evasion ability of the haploid virus, we produced the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 by co-transfecting AAV2, AAV8 and AAV9 helper plasmids at a ratio of 1:1:1. After systemic administration, a 2-fold higher transduction in the liver was observed with the triploid vector AAV2/8/9 than that with AAV8. Nab analysis demonstrated that the triploid AAV2/8/9 vector was able to escape Nab activity from mouse sera immunized with parental serotypes. These results indicate that polyploid viruses might potentially acquire advantages from parental serotypes for enhancement of AAV transduction and evasion of Nab recognition without increasing capsid antigen presentation in target cells. Polyploid AAV vectors can be generated from any AAV serotype, whether natural, rational, library derived or a combination thereof, providing a novel strategy that should be explored in future clinical trials in patients with neutralizing antibodies."

To better assess the future application of AAV7 for systemic administration in the treatment of hemophilia or other liver diseases, we analyzed the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV7 in sera from healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia. In the general population, the prevalence of NAbs to AAV7 was lower than that of AAV2 or AAV3B. However, a higher prevalence of AAV7 NAbs was found in patients with hemophilia. In summary, results from this study suggest that AAV7 vectors should be considered as an effective vehicle for human liver targeting in future clinical trials."

In the absence of the helper virus, AAV can persist in an episomal or integrated form. Previous studies have analyzed the DNA damage response (DDR) induced upon AAV replication to understand how it controls AAV replication. In particular, it was shown that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, a major player of the DDR induced by double-stranded DNA breaks and stalled replication forks, could negatively regulate AdV and AAV replication during coinfection. In contrast, MRN favors HSV-1 replication and is recruited to AAV replication compartments that are induced in the presence of HSV-1. In this study, we examined the role of MRN during AAV replication induced by HSV-1. Our results indicated that knockdown of MRN significantly reduced AAV DNA replication after coinfection with wild-type (wt) HSV-1 or HSV-1 with the polymerase deleted. This effect was specific to wt AAV, since it did not occur with recombinant AAV vectors. Positive regulation of AAV replication by MRN was dependent on its DNA tethering activity but did not require its nuclease activities. Importantly, knockdown of MRN also negatively regulated AAV integration within the human AAVS1 site, both in the presence and in the absence of HSV-1. Altogether, this work identifies a new function of MRN during integration of the AAV genome and demonstrates that this DNA repair complex positively regulates AAV replication in the presence of HSV-1."

The integration site known as AAVS1 is located in chromosome 19 and contains multiple GCTC repeats that are recognized by the AAV non-structural Rep proteins. These proteins are multifunctional, with an N-terminal origin-binding domain (OBD) and a helicase domain joined together by a short linker. As a first step to understand the process of site-specific integration, we proceeded to characterize the recognition and assembly of Rep68 onto the AAVS1 site. We first determined the x-ray structure of AAV-2 Rep68 OBD in complex with the AAVS1 DNA site. Specificity is achieved through the interaction of a glycine-rich loop that binds the major groove and an α-helix that interacts with a downstream minor groove on the same face of the DNA. Although the structure shows a complex with three OBD molecules bound to the AAVS1 site, we show by using analytical centrifugation and electron microscopy that the full-length Rep68 forms a heptameric complex. Moreover, we determined that a minimum of two direct repeats is required to form a stable complex and to melt DNA. Finally, we show that although the individual domains bind DNA poorly, complex assembly requires oligomerization and cooperation between its OBD, helicase, and the linker domains. "

They have been successfully used in clinical trials to treat hereditary diseases such as haemophilia B (ref. 2), and have been approved for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe. Considerable efforts have been made to engineer AAV variants with novel and biomedically valuable cell tropisms to allow efficacious systemic administration, yet basic aspects of AAV cellular entry are still poorly understood. In particular, the protein receptor(s) required for AAV entry after cell attachment remains unknown. Here we use an unbiased genetic screen to identify proteins essential for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) infection in a haploid human cell line. The most significantly enriched gene of the screen encodes a previously uncharacterized type I transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L (denoted hereafter as AAV receptor (AAVR)). We characterize AAVR as a protein capable of rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane and trafficking to the trans-Golgi network. We show that AAVR directly binds to AAV2 particles, and that anti-AAVR antibodies efficiently block AAV2 infection. Moreover, genetic ablation of AAVR renders a wide range of mammalian cell types highly resistant to AAV2 infection. Notably, AAVR serves as a critical host factor for all tested AAV serotypes. The importance of AAVR for in vivo gene delivery is further highlighted by the robust resistance of Aavr(-/-) (also known as Au040320(-/-) and Kiaa0319l(-/-)) mice to AAV infection. Collectively, our data indicate that AAVR is a universal receptor involved in AAV infection. "

The present study evaluated whether in vivo satellite glial cell (SGC) transduction in the DRG can be enhanced by the SGC-specific GFAP promoter and by using shH10 and shH19, which are engineered capsid variants with Müller glia-prone transduction. Titer-matched AAV6 (as control), AAVshH10, and AAVshH19, all encoding the EGFP driven by the constitutively active CMV promoter, as well as AAV6-EGFP and AAVshH10-EGFP driven by a GFAP promoter (AAV6-GFAP-EGFP and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP), were injected into DRG of adult male rats. Neurotropism of gene expression was determined and compared by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that injection of AAV6- and AAVshH10-GFAP-EGFP induces robust EGFP expression selectively in SGCs, whereas injection of either AAVshH10-CMV-EGFP or AAVshH19-CMV-EGFP into DRG resulted in a similar in vivo transduction profile to AAV6-CMV-EGFP, all showing efficient transduction of sensory neurons without significant transduction of glial cell populations. Coinjection of AAV6-CMV-mCherry and AAV6-GFAP-EGFP induces transgene expression in neurons and SGCs separately. This report, together with our prior studies, demonstrates that the GFAP promoter rather than capsid tropism determines selective gene expression in SGCs following intraganglionic AAV delivery in adult rats. A dual AAV system, one with GFAP promoter and the other with CMV promoter, can efficiently express transgenes selectively in neurons versus SGCs."

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently a leader for direct in vivo gene therapy. To date, AAV is safe in patients, with clinical benefit in trials to treat blindness, hemophilia, and a lipid disorder, with many more trials underway. Despite this remarkable progress, barriers exist for AAV vectors to be effective gene transfer vehicles in all organ/cell targets, as well as patient subpopulations. Extracellular vesicles (EVs, e.g., exosomes, microvesicles) are natural lipid particles released by many cell types. They have been reported to mediate cell to cell communication via transferred contents including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. These properties of EV attracted our attention to help solve certain gene transfer issues encountered by AAV vectors. We made the initial discovery that a subpopulation of AAV vectors isolated from media directly interacted with EVs [referred to as exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV)]. In following reports, we have demonstrated that exo-AAV has advantages over the conventional AAV vector in areas such as anti-AAV antibody evasion and transduction of cells of the eye and cochlea in preclinical models. The work of others using EVs as therapeutics as well as our continued development of the exo-AAV platform may advance the field towards useful clinical applications.

We recently developed a synthetic protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that transduces cells preferentially in environments rich in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are elevated in a variety of diseases, including various cancers and heart diseases. The provector displays peptide locks made up of MMP recognition sites flanking an inactivating sequence (IS) composed of four aspartic acid residues (D4). When present, the IS prevents AAV from binding cell receptors and no transduction occurs (OFF state). High levels of MMPs cleave the recognition sequences and release the IS from the capsid surface, restoring cell receptor binding (ON state). The AAV9 provector prototype is not optimal as it displays baseline OFF transduction at 5-10% of that of the wild-type capsid, which can lead to off-target delivery. We hypothesized that changes to the IS may decrease OFF state transduction. We created a provector panel with IS of lengths 0 (D0) to 10 (D10) aspartic acid residues and characterized this panel in vitro. Notably, we find that the D10 provector has an OFF transduction of less than 1% of wild-type capsid and an ON/OFF transduction ratio of 27, the best outcome achieved for any provector thus far. In summary, our results enable us to define new design rules for the provector platform, specifically that (1) the IS is necessary for provector locking and (2) increasing the number of aspartic acid residues in this sequence improves locking."

We confirmed the infectivity of the AAV-NF-κB-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells using a traditional luciferase readout. Mice were infused with AAV-NF-κB-luciferase 5 weeks before induction of pancreatitis (caerulein, 50 μg/kg). Unlike transgenic mice that globally express NF-κB-luciferase, AAV-infused mice showed a 15-fold increase in pancreas-specific NF-κB bioluminescence following 12 h of caerulein compared with baseline luminescence (p < 0.05). The specificity of the NF-κB-luciferase signal to the pancreas was confirmed by isolating the pancreas and adjacent organs and observing a predominant bioluminescent signal in the pancreas compared with liver, spleen, and stomach. A complementary mouse model of post-ERCP-pancreatitis also induced pancreatic NF-κB signals. Taken together these data provide the first demonstration that NF-κB activation can be examined in a live, dynamic fashion during pancreatic inflammation.

AAV capsid proteins (VPs) are critical for viral infectivity and vector potency. Thus, complete characterization of the constituent viral capsid proteins of AAV vectors, including their sequences and post-translational modifications (PTMs), is highly recommended to ensure AAV product quality and consistency. Typically, SDS-PAGE analysis followed by in-gel enzymatic digestion and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is used for the characterization of viral capsid proteins. However, due to the limited recovery of digested peptides from the gel, determination of N-terminal sequences of VPs has not been reported to date. In this study, a direct liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) intact protein analysis was developed to characterize viral capsid proteins in a variety of AAV serotypes. Both N- and C-terminal sequences of six AAV serotypes have been identified based on accurate mass measurement. This method can be used to confirm the identity of AAV serotype and monitor potential capsid protein heterogeneity. Complete sequence confirmation of AAV2 VPs was achieved through LC/MS/MS analysis of peptides generated using multiple enzymatic digestions. LC/MS/MS analysis confirmed the sequences for both N- and C-termini of capsid VPs and revealed acetylation on the N-termini of VP1 and VP3, consistent with LC/MS intact protein analysis."

Whereas AAV-2 is dependent on adenoviral functions for productive replication, it conversely inhibits adenoviral replication, both when its genome is present in trans after coinfection with both viruses and when it is present in cis, as in the production of recombinant adenovirus (rAd)/AAV-2 hybrid vectors. The notion that AAV-mediated inhibition of adenoviral replication is due predominantly to the expression of the AAV-2 Rep proteins was recently challenged by successful Rep78 expression in a rAd5 vector through recoding of the Rep open reading frame (ORF). We closely analyzed the relative contributions of AAV-2 nucleic acid elements and Rep protein expression to the inhibition of adenoviral replication in both of the above scenarios. When present in cis, a sequence element in the 3' part of the rep gene, comprising only the AAV-2 p40 promoter and the AAV-2 intron sequence, which we termed the RIS-Ad, completely blocks adenoviral replication. p5/p19 promoter-driven Rep protein expression, on the other hand, only weakly inhibits rAd/AAV-2 vector propagation, and by inactivation of the RIS-Ad, it is feasible to generate first-generation rAd vectors expressing functional Rep proteins. The RIS-Ad plays no role in the inhibition of adenoviral replication in trans in a model closely mimicking AAV-2-Ad coinfection. In this case, expression of the Rep proteins is required, as well as the presence of an amplifiable inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-containing template. Thus, very different AAV-2 elements and mechanisms are involved in inhibition of adenoviral replication during rAd/AAV-2 vector propagation and after Ad-AAV coinfection."

The retinal morphology, optokinetic behaviour and electrophysiological function of the treated animals were analysed. The subretinal delivery of AAV-2/2 vectors induced robust EPO gene expressions in the retinas. AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy ameliorated the photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairments of the RD animal model. Furthermore, the multi-electrodes array (MEA) was used to detect the firing activities of retinal ganglion cells. MEA recording showed that the EPO therapy could restrain the spontaneous firing response, enhance the light-induced firing response and preserve the basic configurations of visual signal pathway in RD model. Our MEA assay provided an example to evaluate the potency of pharmacological compounds on retinal plasticity. In conclusion, AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy can ameliorate the photoreceptor degeneration and rectify the abnormities in visual signal transmission.

This permits incorporation of genomic sequences as well as cDNA, large transcriptional regulatory sequences for cell-specific expression, multiple transgene cassettes, or genetic elements from other viruses. Hybrid vectors use elements from HSV-1 that allow replication and packaging of large-vector DNA into highly infectious particles, and elements from other viruses that confer genetic stability to vector DNA in the transduced cell. For example, adeno-associated virus (AAV) has the unique ability to integrate its genome into a specific site on human chromosome 19. The viral rep gene and the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the AAV genome are sufficient for this process. However, AAV-based vectors have a very small transgene capacity and do not conventionally contain the rep gene to support site-specific genomic integration. HSV/AAV hybrid vectors contain both HSV-1 replication and packaging functions and the AAV rep gene and a transgene cassette flanked by the AAV ITRs. This combines the large transgene capacity of HSV-1 with the capability of site-specific genomic transgene integration and long-term transgene expression of AAV. This protocol describes the preparation of HSV/AAV hybrid vectors using a replication-competent/conditional, packaging-defective HSV-1 genome cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to provide helper functions for vector replication and packaging.

However, certain factors, most notably host immunity to the vector, prevent their widespread use. In patients who have pre-existing antibodies to AAV, these vectors will be rapidly cleared. Administration of a relatively high initial dose of vector to achieve and sustain a higher margin of therapeutic benefit is limited by concerns of vector dose-dependent T cell response. Frequent vector administration necessitated by the non-integrating nature of the virus is difficult due to the variable, yet significant host immunological memory. Thus generation of AAV vectors that are immunologically inert is pivotal for the long-term success with this promising vector system. Several strategies, that aim targeted disruption of antigenic sites or those that chemically modify the vectors have been proposed for host immune evasion.

Detailed interpretation of the structural features of AAVr3.45, which was previously engineered from AAV2, demonstrated that the LATQVGQKTA peptide at the heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding domain, especially the presence of cationic lysine on the peptide, served as a key motif for dramatically enhancing its gene delivery capabilities, ultimately broadening its tropisms for many cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the substitution of valine on the AAV2 capsid at the amino acid 719 site to methionine functioned as a coordinator for promoting viral resistance against IgG inactivation. The NAb-resistant characteristics of AAVr3.45 were possibly associated with the LATQVGQKTA sequence itself, indicating that its synergistic cooperation with the point mutation (V719M) is required for maximizing its ability to evade NAb inactivation. The potential of AAVr3.45 as a cancer gene therapy agent was confirmed by provoking apoptosis in breast adenocarcinoma by efficiently delivering a pro-apoptotic gene, BIM (Bcl-2-like protein 11), under high titers of human IgG.

Thus, these two administration routes led to distinct transduction patterns in the marmoset CNS, which could be utilized to generate different disease animal models and to deliver therapeutic genes for the treatment of diseases affecting distinct brain areas."

Intact protein mass analysis is a rapid, reliable, and sensitive method to confirm AAV serotypes based on accurate mass measurement of the constituent capsid proteins. Compared to commonly applied reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) methods, we demonstrated that, using a wide-pore amide-bonded column, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) could achieve improved separation of VPs from a variety of AAV serotypes using a generic method prior to MS detection. Moreover, HILIC-based separation was shown to be particularly sensitive in detecting capsid protein variants resulting from different post-translational modifications (PTMs) (e.g. phosphorylation and oxidation) and protein backbone clippings, making it ideally suited for capsid heterogeneity characterization. To overcome the challenges associated with low protein concentrations of AAV samples, as well as the trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-induced ion suppression during HILIC-MS analysis, different strategies were implemented to improve method sensitivity, including increasing the HILIC column loading and the application of a desolvation gas modification device. Finally, we demonstrated that this integrated HILIC-FLR-MS method can be generically applied to characterize a variety of AAV serotype samples at low concentrations without any sample treatment to achieve unambiguous serotype identification, stoichiometry assessment, and PTM characterization."

To date, it remains a major challenge to achieve higher transduction efficiency with a lower dose of rAAV vector. Our previous studies have demonstrated that serum proteins are able to directly interact with AAV virions for transduction enhancement. Herein, we explored the effect of the FerA domains, which are derived from ferlin proteins and possess membrane-fusion activity, on AAV transduction. Our results show that FerA domains from dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin proteins are able to directly interact with AAV vectors and enhance AAV transduction in vitro and in mice through either intravenous or intramuscular injections. The enhanced AAV transduction induced by human/mouse FerA domains is achieved in various cell lines and in mice regardless of AAV serotypes. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the FerA domains could effectively enhance the ability of AAV vectors to bind to target cells and cross the vascular barrier. Additionally, FerA domains slow down the blood clearance of AAV. Systemic administration of AAV8/hFIX-FerA complex induced approximate 4-fold more human coagulation factor IX expression and improved hemostasis in hemophilia B mice than that of AAV8/hFIX. Collectively, we show, for the first time, that multiple FerA domains could be tethered on the AAV capsid and enhance widespread tissue distribution in an AAV serotypes-independent manner. This approach therefore holds a promise for future clinical application."

Our previous research revealed that Bmi-1 was overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC) and it's overexpression was an independent negative prognostic factor, suggesting it can be a therapeutic target. The main purpose of this investigation was to explore the antitumor activity of Bmi-1 interference driven by its own promoter (Ad-Bmi-1i) for GC. In this study, we used adenoviral vector to deliver Bmi-1 shRNA driven by its own promoter to treat GC. Our results revealed that Ad-Bmi-1i could selectively silence Bmi-1 in GC cells which overexpress Bmi-1 and suppress the malignant phenotypes and stem-like properties of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, direct injection of Ad-Bmi-1i into xenografts suppressed tumor growth and destroyed cancer cells in vivo. Ad-Bmi-1i inhibited the proliferation of GC cells mainly via inducing senescence in vitro, but it suppressed tumor through inducing senescence and apoptosis, and inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo. Bmi-1 knockdown by Ad-Bmi-1i downregulated VEGF via inhibiting AKT activity. These results suggest that Ad-Bmi-1i not only inhibits tumor growth and stem cell-like phenotype by inducing cellular senescence directly, but also has an indirect anti-tumor activity by anti-angiogenesis effects via regulating PTEN/AKT/VEGF pathway. Transfer of gene interference guided by its own promoter by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector might be a potent antitumor approach for cancer therapy. "

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules have been used to target the central nervous system (CNS) and are expected to have clinical utility against refractory neurodegenerative diseases. However, siRNA is characterized by low transduction efficiency, insufficient inhibition of gene expression, and short duration of therapeutic effects, and is thus not ideal for treatment of neural tissues and diseases. To address these problems, viral delivery of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes that support more efficient and long-lasting transduction into target tissues is expected to be a promising delivery tool. Various types of gene therapy vectors have been developed, such as adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), herpes simplex virus and lentivirus; however, AAV is particularly advantageous because of its relative lack of immunogenicity and lack of chromosomal integration. In human clinical trials, recombinant AAV vectors are relatively safe and well-tolerated. In particular, serotype 9 of AAV (AAV9) vectors show the highest tropism for neural tissue and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and we have shown that intrathecal delivery of AAV9 yields relatively high gene transduction into dorsal root ganglia or spinal cord. This chapter describes how to successfully use AAV vectors encoding shRNA in vivo, particularly for RNA interference in the central and peripheral nervous system. "

Current manufacturing procedures necessitate laborious and time-consuming purification procedures to obtain AAV particles of sufficient titer and purity for these demanding biomedical applications. The finding that AAV can be harvested and purified from producer cell medium may represent an efficient alternative to purifying AAV from cellular lysates. Here we sought to determine the maximum duration of time, and frequency within which AAV can be harvested from producer cell medium, in order to maximize the yield obtained from a single transfection preparation. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with polyethylenimine to produce AAV2/5 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cellular medium was harvested every 2 days until a maximum duration of 19 days posttransfection. AAV2/5-GFP was released into producer cell medium at a steady state until 7 days posttransfection, at which time titers dropped dramatically. Harvesting medium every two days resulted in the maximum yield of AAV from a single preparation, and the cumulative yield of AAV harvested from the producer cell medium was 4-fold higher than the yield obtained from a traditional purification of AAV from cellular lysates. The AAV2/5 harvested from medium within the 7-day collection time-course mediated high levels of transduction in vivo, comparable to AAV2/5 harvested from cellular lysates. AAV purified from cell lysates showed increasing amounts of empty particles at 5 and 7 days posttransfection, whereas AAV purified from cell medium did not show an increase in the amount of empty particles throughout the 7-day time course. Finally, we extended these findings to AAV2/9, demonstrating that a comparable ratio of AAV2/9 particles are also released for up to 7 days posttransfection. "

Structural studies suggest that despite a high degree of sequence variability, antibody recognition sites or antigenic hotspots on AAVs and other related parvoviruses might be evolutionarily conserved. To test this hypothesis, we developed a structure-guided evolution approach that does not require selective pressure exerted by NAbs. This strategy yielded highly divergent antigenic footprints that do not exist in natural AAV isolates. Specifically, synthetic variants obtained by evolving murine antigenic epitopes on an AAV serotype 1 capsid template can evade NAbs without compromising titer, transduction efficiency, or tissue tropism. One lead AAV variant generated by combining multiple evolved antigenic sites effectively evades polyclonal anti-AAV1 neutralizing sera from immunized mice and rhesus macaques. Furthermore, this variant displays robust immune evasion in nonhuman primate and human serum samples at dilution factors as high as 1:5, currently mandated by several clinical trials. Our results provide evidence that antibody recognition of AAV capsids is conserved across species. This approach can be applied to any AAV strain to evade NAbs in prospective patients for human gene therapy."

The contributions of basic amino acids at this and other sites were characterized using site-directed mutagenesis. Both heparin and cell binding are correlated to positive charge at the disaccharide binding site, and transduction is significantly decreased in AAV-3B vectors mutated at this site to reduce heparin binding. While the receptor attachment sites of AAV-3B and AAV-2 are both in the general vicinity of the viral spikes, the exact amino acids that participate in electrostatic interactions are distinct. Diversity in the mechanisms of cell attachment by AAV serotypes will be an important consideration for the rational design of improved gene therapy vectors."

Although the innate immune response is immediately activated following AAV vector infection via TLR pathways, no studies exist regarding the role of the innate immune response at later time points after AAV vector transduction. Herein, activation of the innate immune response in cell lines, primary human hepatocytes, and hepatocytes in a human chimeric mouse model was observed at later time points following AAV vector transduction. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5 was necessary for innate immune response activation and that transient knockdown of MDA5, or MAVS, decreased IFN-β expression while increasing transgene production in AAV-transduced cells. These results both highlight the role of the dsRNA-triggered innate immune response in therapeutic transgene expression at later time points following AAV transduction and facilitate the execution of effective strategies to block the dsRNA innate immune response in future clinical trials."

In contrast, AAV-mediated gene transfer into liver or muscle tissue for diseases such as hemophilia B, α1 anti-trypsin deficiency and muscular dystrophy has demonstrated a decline in gene transfer efficacy over time. It is now known that in humans, AAV triggers specific pathways that recruit immune sensors. These factors initiate an immediate reaction against either the viral capsid or the vector encoded protein as part of innate immune response or to produce a more specific adaptive response that generates immunological memory. The vector-transduced cells are then rapidly destroyed due to this immune activation. However, unlike other viral vectors, AAV is not immunogenic in murine models. Its immunogenicity becomes apparent only in large animal models and human subjects. Moreover, humans are natural hosts to AAV and exhibit a high seroprevalence against AAV vectors. This limits the widespread application of AAV vectors into patients with pre-existing neutralising antibodies or memory T cells. To address these issues, various strategies are being tested. Alternate serotype vectors (AAV1-10), efficient expression cassettes, specific tissue targeting, immune-suppression and engineered capsid variants are some approaches proposed to minimise this immune stimulation. In this review, we have summarised the nature of the immune response documented against AAV in various pre-clinical and clinical settings and have further discussed the strategies to evade them."

This study is the first study to analyze wild-type AAV integration in diploid human fibroblasts. Applying high-throughput third-generation PacBio-based DNA sequencing, integration profiles of wild-type AAV and rAAV are compared side by side. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that both wild-type AAV and rAAV prefer open chromatin regions. Although genomic features of AAV integration largely reproduce previous findings, the pattern of integration hot spots differs from that described in HeLa cells before. DNase-Seq data for human fibroblasts and for HeLa cells reveal variant chromatin accessibility at preferred AAV integration hot spots that correlates with variant hot spot preferences. DNase-Seq patterns of these sites in human tissues, including liver, muscle, heart, brain, skin, and embryonic stem cells further underline variant chromatin accessibility. In summary, AAV integration is dependent on cell-type-specific, variant chromatin accessibility leading to random integration profiles for rAAV, whereas wild-type AAV integration sites cluster near GAGY/C repeats."

It is necessary to develop new treatment methods to control neovascularization with a stable and effective effect. Kringle1 domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGFK1) has anti-angiogenesis activity. Here, we established oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model to study if using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a delivery system to overexpression HGFK1 in retinal cells could benefit retinal neovascularization. We show that, overexpressed exogenous gene was mainly expressed in the inner and outer nuclear layer of the retina. Compared with control mice, the mice pretreated with rAAV-HGFK1 at P3 showed relatively normal vascular branches examined by fluorescence fundus angiography. Subsequent H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining of CD31 of the eye tissue sections showed that the mice received rAAV-HGFK1 had a relatively normal distribution of vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining indicated a lower expression of VEGF in the eye tissues of rAAV-HGFK1 treated OIR mice. Further in vitro studies showed that HGFK1 could inhibit the proliferation but promote the apoptosis of bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRECs) under the presence of VEGF. Moreover, HGFK1 could inhibit VEGF induced ERK activation but promote p38 activation in BRECs. Therefore, we propose that intravitreal injection of rAAV-HGFK1 might be used to improve the retinal neovascularization and HGFK1 may function through regulating VEGF signaling pathway to inhibit neovascularization."

However, its transduction capabilities are not optimal due to the interaction with various host factors within the cell. In a previous study, we identified members of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway as significant restriction factors in AAV gene transduction. In the present study, we explored the scope of this restriction by focusing on the AAV capsid and host cell proteins as targets. We show that during vector production, the capsid protein VP2 becomes SUMOylated, as indicated by deletion and point mutations of VP2 or the obstruction of its N terminus via the addition of a tag. We observed that SUMOylated AAV capsids display higher stability than non-SUMOylated capsids. Prevention of capsid SUMOylation by VP2 mutations did not abolish transduction restriction by SUMOylation; however, it reduced activation of gene transduction by shutdown of the cellular SUMOylation pathway. This indicates a link between capsid SUMOylation and SUMOylation of cellular proteins in restricting gene transduction. Infection with AAV triggers general SUMOylation of cellular proteins. In particular, the DAXX protein, a putative host cell restriction factor that can become SUMOylated, is able to restrict AAV gene transduction by reducing the intracellular accumulation of AAV vectors. We also observe that the coexpression of a SUMOylation inhibitor with an AAV2 reporter gene vector increased gene transduction significantly."

While animal models are very useful, they often exhibit differences in retinal cell surface receptors compared to the human retina.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype also predicts the timing and amount of brain amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition and amyloid burden (ε4 >ε3 >ε2). Using several administration protocols, we now report that direct intracerebral adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of APOE2 markedly reduces brain soluble (including oligomeric) and insoluble Aβ levels as well as amyloid burden in 2 mouse models of brain amyloidosis whose pathology is dependent on either the expression of murine Apoe or more importantly on human APOE4. The efficacy of APOE2 to reduce brain Aβ burden in either model, however, was highly dependent on brain APOE2 levels and the amount of pre-existing Aβ and amyloid deposition. We further demonstrate that a widespread reduction of brain Aβ burden can be achieved through a single injection of vector via intrathalamic delivery of AAV expressing APOE2 gene. Our results demonstrate that AAV gene delivery of APOE2 using an AAV vector rescues the detrimental effects of APOE4 on brain amyloid pathology and may represent a viable therapeutic approach for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease especially if sufficient brain APOE2 levels can be achieved early in the course of the disease."

Since most commonly used recombinant AAV vectors contain a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is transcriptionally inactive, efficient transgene expression from AAV vectors is dependent upon viral second-strand DNA synthesis. We have also identified a transcription suppressor sequence in one of the D sequences, which shares homology with the binding site for the cellular NF-κB-repressing factor (NRF). The removal of this D sequence from, and replacement with a sequence containing putative binding sites for transcription factors in, single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) vectors significantly augments transgene expression both in human cell lines in vitro and in murine hepatocytes in vivo.

Some of the challenges include variable levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and poor transduction in specific target tissues and/or diseases. In addition, readministration of an rAAV vector is in general not possible due to the immune response against the capsid. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors with novel capsids can be isolated in nature or developed through different directed evolution strategies. However, in most cases, the process of AAV selection is not well understood and new strategies are required to define the best parameters to develop more efficient and functional rAAV capsids. Therefore, the use of barcoding for AAV capsid libraries, which can be screened by high-throughput sequencing, provides a powerful tool to track AAV capsid evolution and potentially improve AAV capsid library screens. In this study, we examined how different parameters affect the screen of two different AAV libraries in two human cell types. We uncovered new and unexpected insights in how to maximize the likelihood of obtaining AAV variants with the desired properties. The major findings of the study are the following. (1) Inclusion of helper-virus for AAV replication can selectively propagate variants that can replicate to higher titers, but are not necessarily better at transduction. (2) Competition between AAVs with specific capsids can take place in cells that have been infected with different AAVs. (3) The use of low multiplicity of infections for infection results in more variation between screens and is not optimal at selecting the most desired capsids. (4) Using multiple rounds of selection can be counterproductive. We conclude that each of these parameters should be taken into consideration when screening AAV libraries for enhanced properties of interest."

In particular, the trafficking steps preceding the release of incoming AAV particles from the endosomal system into the cytoplasm, allowing subsequent nuclear import and the initiation of gene expression, remain to be elucidated fully. Others and we previously showed that a significant proportion of viral particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus and that Golgi apparatus disruption caused by the drug brefeldin A efficiently blocks AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) transduction. However, because brefeldin A is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the entire endosomal system, the functional relevance of transport to the Golgi apparatus for AAV transduction remains to be established definitively. Here, we show that AAV2 trafficking toward the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the Golgi apparatus correlates with transduction efficiency and relies on a nonclassical retrograde transport pathway that is independent of the retromer complex, late endosomes, and recycling endosomes. AAV2 transduction is unaffected by the knockdown of syntaxins 6 and 16, which are two major effectors in the retrograde transport of both exogenous and endogenous cargo. On the other hand, inhibition of syntaxin 5 function by small interfering RNA silencing or treatment with cyclized Retro-2 strongly decreases AAV2 transduction and transport to the Golgi apparatus. This inhibition of transduction is observed with several AAV serotypes and a number of primary and immortalized cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that syntaxin 5-mediated retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus is a broadly conserved feature of AAV trafficking that appears to be independent of the identity of the receptors used for viral attachment."

Recent studies have revealed that, following intraganglionic or intrathecal injection, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors can also infect sensory neurons and are capable of stable, long-term transgene expression. We sought to determine if application of rAAV to peripheral nerve termini at the epithelial surface would allow rAAV to traffic to sensory ganglia in a manner similar to that seen with HSV. We hypothesized that footpad or ocular inoculation with rAAV8 would result in transduction of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or trigeminal ganglia (TG), respectively. To test this, we inoculated the footpads of mice with various amounts of rAAV as well as rAAV capsid mutants. We demonstrated that this method of inoculation can achieve a transduction rate of >90% of the sensory neurons in the DRG that innervate the footpad. Similarly, we showed that corneal inoculation with rAAV vectors in the rabbit efficiently transduced >70% of the TG neurons in the optic tract. Finally, we demonstrated that coinfection of mouse footpads or rabbit eyes with rAAV vectors and HSV-1 resulted in colocalization in nearly all of the HSV-1-positive neurons. These results suggest that rAAV is a useful tool for the study of HSV-1 infection and may provide a means to deliver therapeutic cargos for the treatment of HSV infections or of dysfunctions of sensory ganglia."

AAVs have been demonstrated to be safe, and resulted in high and long-term expression in preclinical and clinical studies. However, there are still some concerns regarding the expression levels that can be achieved and the percentage of hepatocytes that can be transduced. Because of the cell-autonomous nature of most metabolic liver disorders, a high percentage of hepatocytes needs to be corrected in order to achieve a therapeutic effect. The goal of our work was to improve transduction efficacy of the liver by conveying the vector directly to hepatic tissue. Interventional radiology procedures were used to administer an AAV5 vector expressing a secreted form of human embryonic alkaline phosphatase (hSEAP) under the control of a liver-specific promoter to a clinically relevant animal model, Macaca fascicularis. Balloon occlusion of the regional hepatic venous flow was performed while injecting the vector either into the hepatic artery (HA) or, against flow, via the suprahepatic vein (SHV). In both cases the vector was injected into the right hepatic lobules, and the two routes were compared with conventional intravenous administration. Higher hSEAP levels were obtained when the vector was administered via SHV or HA than after intravenous injection. Furthermore, higher expression levels correlated with a higher number of vector genomes in the injected lobules. In conclusion, direct administration of AAV vectors via the hepatic blood flow with simultaneous balloon occlusion of the hepatic outflow increases liver transduction efficacy in comparison with systemic delivery and can be further improved in bigger animals or humans, where it would be technically feasible to inject the vector into the hepatic vasculature in the generality of lobules."

Addressing this need, we used clinical assays that were validated according to guidelines for a comprehensive characterization of anti-AAV1, -AAV2, -AAV5, and -AAV8 immunity in large international cohorts of healthy donors and patients with hemophilia B.

Gene therapy products, a relatively new strategy for drug design with very few licensed examples, represent a unique challenge for the measure of potency. Unlike traditional drugs, potency for a gene therapeutic is a tally of the measures of multiple steps, including infectivity, transcription, translation, protein modifications, proper localization of the protein product, and protein function. This is particularly challenging for products based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, which has poor in vitro infectivity, limiting the sensitivity and thus the usefulness of cell-based assays. A rigorous in vivo assay has been established that separately evaluates infection, transcription, and resulting protein levels with specifications for each based on real time polymerase chain reaction (DNA and RNA) and standard protein assays. For an acceptance criterion, an administered vector must have vector DNA, transgene mRNA, and transgene expressed protein each concurrently meet individual specifications or the production lot fails. Using the AAVrh.10 serotype as a model vector and three different transgenes as examples, the assay is based on intravenous administration of the vector to male mice.

Moreover, rAAVs have a low immunogenic profile, and the various AAV serotypes and variants display broad but distinct tropisms. One limitation of rAAVs is that their genome-packaging capacity is only ∼5 kb. For most applications this is not of major concern because the median human protein size is 375 amino acids. Excluding the ITRs, for a protein of typical length, this allows the incorporation of ∼3.5 kb of DNA for the promoter, polyadenylation sequence, and other regulatory elements into a single AAV vector. Nonetheless, for certain diseases the packaging limit of AAV does not allow the delivery of a full-length therapeutic protein by a single AAV vector. Hence, approaches to overcome this limitation have become an important area of research for AAV gene therapy. Among the most promising approaches to overcome the limitation imposed by the packaging capacity of AAV is the use of dual-vector approaches, whereby a transgene is split across two separate AAV vectors. Coinfection of a cell with these two rAAVs will then-through a variety of mechanisms-result in the transcription of an assembled mRNA that could not be encoded by a single AAV vector because of the DNA packaging limits of AAV. The main purpose of this review is to assess the current literature with respect to dual-AAV-vector design, to highlight the effectiveness of the different methodologies and to briefly discuss future areas of research to improve the efficiency of dual-AAV-vector transduction.

This study tested several AAV serotypes by canalostomy in adult mice. It is shown that most AAVs transduce the sensory inner hair cells efficiently, but are less efficient at transducing outer hair cells. A subset of AAVs also transduces non-sensory cochlear cell types. Neither the surgical procedure of canalostomy nor the AAV serotypes damage hair cells or impair normal hearing.

The platform is composed of regulator and response elements in a single AAV genome. After infection of Neuro-2a cells with the AAV-SynTetOff vector, the transduction efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was increased by approximately 2- and 15-fold relative to the conventional AAV vector with the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human synapsin I (SYN) promoter, respectively.

By adding a membrane-targeting signal to GFP, the axon fibers of neostriatal neurons were clearly visualized. In contrast, by attaching somatodendritic membrane-targeting signals to GFP, axon fiber labeling was mostly suppressed. Furthermore, we prepared the AAV-SynTetOff vector, which simultaneously expressed somatodendritic membrane-targeted GFP and membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein (RFP). After injection of the vector into the neostriatum, the cell bodies and dendrites of neostriatal neurons were labeled with both GFP and RFP, whereas the axons in the projection sites were labeled only with RFP.

Using an ex vivo organotypic explant system, we previously demonstrated that retinal tropism and transduction of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) varies significantly depending on serotype in human eyes. However, the ex vivo system has limited ability to assess route of ocular delivery, and relatively little literature exists on tropic differences between serotypes and routes of delivery in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that retinal tropism and transduction efficiency of five different AAV2 serotypes (AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, AAV2/9) expressing eGFP driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter vary greatly depending on serotype and route of delivery (intravitreal, subretinal, or suprachoroidal) in rats. With subretinal delivery, all serotypes successfully transduced the retinal pigmented epithelium and outer nuclear layer (ONL), with AAV2/1 displaying the highest transduction efficiency and AAV2/2 and AAV2/6 showing lower ONL transduction. There was minimal transduction of the inner retina via subretinal delivery for any serotype. Tropism by suprachoroidal delivery mirrored that of subretinal delivery for all AAV serotypes but resulted in a wider distribution and greater ONL transduction. With intravitreal delivery, retinal transduction was seen primarily in the inner retina (retinal nerve fiber, ganglion cell, and inner nuclear layers) for AAV2/1 and AAV2/6, with AAV2/6 showing the highest transduction. When compared to data from human explant models, there are substantial differences in tropism and transduction that are important to consider when using rats as preclinical models for the development of ocular gene therapies for humans."

Recognition of the AAV genome by Toll-like receptor-9 triggers the myeloid differentiation primary response signaling cascade for innate (IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β) and adaptive (CD8+ T-cell, B-cell) immune response against the viral capsid and the transgene product. Herein, we highlight a potential intersection of the UPR, PTMs, and intracellular trafficking pathways, which could be fine-tuned to augment the outcome of AAV-based gene delivery."

These findings have resulted in the identification of therapeutic genes that can be packaged in viral capsids for the treatment of a variety of neurological conditions, including neurodegenerative, metabolic, and enzyme deficiency disorders. Recent data have demonstrated that gene-carrying viral vectors (most often adeno-associated viruses) can be effectively distributed by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in a safe, reliable, targeted, and homogeneous manner across the blood-brain barrier. Critically, these vectors can be monitored using real-time MRI of a co-infused surrogate tracer to accurately predict vector distribution and transgene expression at the perfused site. The unique properties of CED of adeno-associated virus vectors allow for cell-specific transgene manipulation of the infused anatomical site and/or widespread interconnected sites via antero- and/or retrograde transport.

Before implementation of CjCas9 as an in vivo therapeutic modality, it is essential to investigate the long-term effects of target gene disruption via AAV-mediated delivery of CjCas9 in vivo. In this study, histologic and electroretinographic analyses demonstrated that CjCas9 targeted to Hif1a did not induce any definite toxicity in the retina, although the target gene was mutated with a frequency ranging from 45% to 79% in retinal or retinal pigment epithelial cells. Importantly, at 14 months after injection, no indels were detected at potential off-target sites identified using Digenome-seq and Cas-OFFinder, suggesting that long-term expression of CjCas9 does not aggravate off-target effects. Taken together, our results show that intravitreal injection of AAV encoding CjCas9 targeted to Hif1a effectively induced and maintained mutations in retinal tissues for more than 1 year and did not affect retinal histologic integrity or functions."

Each step in generating and utilizing viral vectors involves numerous molecular interactions that together determine the efficiency of vector production and gene delivery. Once delivered into the cell, interactions with host proteins will determine the fate of the viral genome, and these will impact the intended goal of gene delivery.

However, gene delivery to kidney cells is inefficient. This is due, in part, to the fact that the kidney excludes molecules above 50 kDa and that most gene delivery vectors are megaDaltons in mass. We compared the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus (Ad), and lentiviral (LV) vectors to deliver genes to renal cells. When vectors were delivered by the intravenous (IV) route in mice, weak luciferase activity was observed in the kidney with substantially more in the liver. When gene delivery was observed in the kidney, expression was primarily in the glomerulus. To avoid these limitations, vectors were injected directly into the kidney by retrograde ureteral (RU) and subcapsular (SC) injections in mice. Small AAV vectors transduced the kidney, but also leaked from the organ and mediated higher levels of transduction in off-target tissues. Comparison of AAV2, 6.2, 8, and rh10 vectors by direct kidney injection demonstrated highest delivery by AAV6.2 and 8. Larger Ad and LV vectors transduced kidney cells and mediated less off-target tissue transduction. These data demonstrate the utility of direct kidney injections to circumvent the kidney size exclusion barrier. They also identify the effects of vector size on on-target and off-target transduction. This lays the foundation for the use of different vector platforms for gene therapy of diverse kidney diseases."

Cardinal phenotypic features of CAH include genital ambiguity and sexual precocity, and in severe cases, neonatal salt loss and death. Current standard of care consists of lifelong oral steroid replacement to reverse the cortisol deficiency. Although significant advances in the treatment of CAH have been made, the burden of a lifelong therapeutic intervention is not ideal for quality of life. Gene therapy for CAH by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has been shown to efficiently transduce the adrenal cortex, restoring normal steroidogenesis in the short term. However, adrenocortical cells are continuously renewed by stem cells located at the adrenal capsule, which differentiate as they centripetally migrate towards the adrenal medulla where they undergo apoptosis.

Such cannot be achieved by utilizing sequence data alone but requires harnessing the three-dimensional (3D) structural properties of AAV capsids. Here, we solve the structures of a natural AAV isolate complexed with antibodies using cryo-electron microscopy and harness this structural information to engineer AAV capsid libraries through saturation mutagenesis of different antigenic footprints. Each surface loop was evolved by infectious cycling in the presence of a helper adenovirus to yield a new AAV variant that then serves as a template for evolving the next surface loop. This stepwise process yielded a humanized AAV8 capsid (AAVhum.8) displaying nonnatural surface loops that simultaneously display tropism for human hepatocytes, increased gene transfer efficiency, and neutralizing antibody evasion. Specifically, AAVhum.8 can better evade neutralizing antisera from multiple species than AAV8. Further, AAVhum.8 displays robust transduction in a human liver xenograft mouse model with expanded tropism for both murine and human hepatocytes. This work supports the hypothesis that critical properties, such as AAV capsid antibody evasion and tropism, can be coevolved by combining rational design and library-based evolution for clinical gene therapy."

The gene expression and replication of AAV and derived recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are severely limited (>10-fold) by the cellular DNA damage-sensing complex made up of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN). The AAV genome does not encode the means to circumvent this block to productive infection but relies on coinfecting helper virus to do so. Using adenovirus helper proteins E1B55k and E4orf6, which enhance the transduction of AAV via degradation of MRN, we investigated the mechanism through which this DNA damage complex inhibits gene expression from rAAV. We tested the substrate specificity of inhibition and the contribution of different functions of the MRN complex. Our results demonstrate that both single- and double-stranded rAAV vectors are inhibited by MRN, which is in contrast to the predominant model that inhibition is the result of a block to second-strand synthesis. Exploring the contribution of known functions of MRN, we found that inhibition of rAAV does not require downstream DNA damage response factors, including signaling kinases ATM and ATR. The nuclease domain of Mre11 appears to play only a minor role in inhibition, while the DNA binding domain makes a greater contribution. Additionally, mutation of the inverted terminal repeat of the rAAV genome, which has been proposed to be the signal for interaction with MRN, is tolerated by the mechanism of inhibition. These results articulate a model of inhibition of gene expression in which physical interaction is more important than enzymatic activity and several key downstream damage repair factors are dispensable."

The attachment of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an example that has not proven amenable to crystallography, because the binding of GAG analogs disrupts lattice contacts. The interactions of AAV with GAGs are of interest in mediating the cell specificity of AAV-based gene therapy vectors. Previous electron microscopy led to differing conclusions on the exact binding site and the existence of large ligand-induced conformational changes in the virus. Conformational changes are expected during cell entry, but it has remained unclear whether the electron microscopy provided evidence of their induction by GAG-binding. Taking advantage of automated data collection, careful processing and new methods of structure refinement, the structure of AAV-DJ complexed with sucrose octasulfate is determined by electron microscopy difference map analysis to 4.8Å resolution. At this higher resolution, individual sulfate groups are discernible, providing a stereochemical validation of map interpretation, and highlighting interactions with two surface arginines that have been implicated in genetic studies. Conformational changes induced by the SOS are modest and limited to the loop most directly interacting with the ligand. While the resolution attainable will depend on sample order and other factors, there are an increasing number of macromolecular complexes that can be studied by cryo-electron microscopy at resolutions beyond 5Å, for which the approaches used here could be used to characterize the binding of inhibitors and other small molecule effectors when crystallography is not tractable.

Notably, emerging technologies may provide promising new options for the treatment of CNS disorders. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) has been shown to transduce cells in the CNS following intravascular administration in rodents, cats, pigs, and non-human primates. These results suggest that AAV9 is capable of crossing the BBB. However, mechanisms that govern AAV9 transendothelial trafficking at the BBB remain unknown. Furthermore, possibilities that AAV9 may transduce brain endothelial cells or affect BBB integrity still require investigation. Using primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells as a model of the human BBB, we performed transduction and transendothelial trafficking assays comparing AAV9 to AAV2, a serotype that does not cross the BBB or transduce endothelial cells effectively in vivo. Results of our in vitro studies indicate that AAV9 penetrates brain microvascular endothelial cells barriers more effectively than AAV2, but has reduced transduction efficiency. In addition, our data suggest that (i) AAV9 penetrates endothelial barriers through an active, cell-mediated process, and (ii) AAV9 fails to disrupt indicators of BBB integrity such as transendothelial electrical resistance, tight junction protein expression/localization, and inflammatory activation status. Overall, this report shows how human brain endothelial cells configured in BBB models can be utilized for evaluating transendothelial movement and transduction kinetics of various AAV capsids.

This region contains five basic-amino-acid-rich (BR) clusters, KSKRSRR (AAP2BR1), RRR (AAP2BR2), RFR (AAP2BR3), RSTSSR (AAP2BR4), and RRIK (AAP2BR5), from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. We created 30 AAP2BR mutants by arginine/lysine-to-alanine mutagenesis or deletion of AAP2BRs and 8 and 1 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-AAP2BR and β-galactosidase-AAP2BR fusion proteins, respectively, and analyzed their intracellular localization in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results showed that AAP2(144-184) has redundant multipartite NLSs and that any combinations of 4 AAP2BRs, but not 3 or less, can constitute a functional NLS-NoLS; AAP2BR1 and AAP2BR2 play the most influential role for nuclear localization, but either one of the two AAP2BRs is dispensable if all 4 of the other AAP2BRs are present, resulting in 3 different, overlapping NLS motifs; and the NoLS is shared redundantly among the five AAP2BRs and functions in a context-dependent manner. AAP2BR mutations not only resulted in aberrant intracellular localization, but also attenuated AAP2 protein expression to various degrees, and both of these abnormalities have a significant negative impact on capsid production. Thus, this study reveals the organization of the intermingling NLSs and NoLSs in AAP2 and provides insights into their functional roles in capsid assembly."

In humans, the high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to AAV-2 capsid and the wide cross-reactivity with other serotypes hamper vector transduction efficacy. Moreover, the safety of gene-based approaches depends on vector biodistribution, vector dose, and route of administration. Here we sought to characterize the safety of AAV-5 and AAV-6 for liver-mediated human factor IX (hFIX) expression in rabbits at doses of 1 × 10(12) or 1 × 10(13) viral genomes/kg. Circulating therapeutic levels of FIX were observed in both cohorts of AAV-6-hFIX, whereas for AAV-5-hFIX only the high dose was effective. Long-lasting inhibitory antibodies to hFIX were detected in three of the 10 AAV-6-injected animals but were absent in the AAV-5 group. Overall, vector shedding in the semen was transient and vector dose-dependent. However, the kinetics of clearance were remarkably faster for AAV-5 (3-5 weeks) compared with AAV-6 (10-13 weeks). AAV-6 vector sequences outside the liver were minimal at 20-30 weeks post-injection. In contrast, AAV-5 exhibited relatively high amounts of vector DNA in tissues other than the liver. Together these data are useful to further define the safety and potential for clinical translation of these AAV vectors."

Experimental gene therapies based on gene addition are currently being explored. Following preclinical evaluation in MPSIIIA mice, an adeno-associated virus vector of serotype rh10 designed to deliver SGSH and sulfatase modifying factor 1 (SAF301) was trialed in four MPSIIIA patients, showing good tolerance and absence of adverse events with some improvements in neurocognitive measures. This study aimed to improve SAF301 further by removing sulfatase modifying factor 1 (SUMF1) and assessing if expression of this gene is needed to increase the SGSH enzyme activity (SAF301b). Second, the murine phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promotor was exchanged with a chicken beta actin/CMV composite (CAG) promotor (SAF302) to see if SGSH expression levels could be boosted further. The three different vectors were administered to MPSIIIA mice via intracranial injection, and SGSH expression levels were compared 4 weeks post treatment. Removal of SUMF1 resulted in marginal reductions in enzyme activity. However, promotor exchange significantly increased the amount of SGSH expressed in the brain, leading to superior therapeutic correction with SAF302. Biodistribution of SAF302 was further assessed using green fluorescent protein (GFP), indicating that vector spread was limited to the area around the injection tract. Further modification of the injection strategy to a single depth with higher injection volume increased vector distribution, leading to more widespread GFP distribution and sustained expression, suggesting this approach should be adopted in future trials."

Toward characterizing the SIA binding site(s), the structure of the AAV1-SIA complex was determined by X-ray crystallography to 3.0 Å. Density consistent with SIA was observed in a pocket located at the base of capsid protrusions surrounding icosahedral 3-fold axes. Site-directed mutagenesis substitution of the amino acids forming this pocket with structurally equivalent residues from AAV2, a heparan sulfate binding serotype, followed by cell binding and transduction assays, further mapped the critical residues conferring SIA binding to AAV1 and AAV6. For both viruses five of the six binding pocket residues mutated (N447S, V473D, N500E, T502S, and W503A) abolished SIA binding, whereas S472R increased binding. All six mutations abolished or decreased transduction by at least 50% in AAV1. Surprisingly, the T502S substitution did not affect transduction efficiency of wild-type AAV6. Furthermore, three of the AAV1 SIA binding site mutants-S472R, V473D, and N500E-escaped recognition by the anti-AAV1 capsid antibody ADK1a. These observations demonstrate that common key capsid surface residues dictate both virus binding and entry processes, as well as antigenic reactivity.

When the Nab titer assay was performed in vivo via intramuscular (IM) or systemic administration, a fourfold increase in sensitivity for measurement of Nab titers was observed compared with an identical in vitro test.

Because glycosylation of capsid proteins is known to be rate limiting in the life cycle of many viruses, we reasoned that perturbation of glycosylation sites in AAV2 capsid will enhance gene delivery. In our first set experiments, pharmacological modulation of the glycosylation status in host cells, modestly decreased (1-fold) AAV2 packaging efficacy while it improved their gene expression (∼74%) in vitro. We then generated 24 mutant AAV2 vectors modified to potentially create or disrupt a glycosylation site in its capsid. Three of them demonstrated a 1.3-2.5-fold increase in transgene expression in multiple cell lines (HeLa, Huh7, and ARPE-19). Hepatic gene transfer of these vectors in hemophilia B mice, resulted in a 2-fold increase in human coagulation factor (F)IX levels, while its T/B-cell immunogenic response was unaltered. Subsequently, intravitreal gene transfer of glycosylation site-modified vectors in C57BL6/J mice demonstrated an increase in green fluorescence protein expression (∼2- to 4-fold) and enhanced permeation across retina.

To elucidate the capsid determinants of this process, structural differences between wild-type (wt) AAV2 and a packaging deficient variant, AAV2-R432A, were examined using cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction both at an ∼5.0-Å resolution (medium) and also at 3.8- and 3.7-Å resolutions (high), respectively. The high resolution structures showed that removal of the arginine side chain in AAV2-R432A eliminated hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in altered intramolecular and intermolecular interactions propagated from under the 3-fold axis toward the 5-fold channel. Consistent with these observations, differential scanning calorimetry showed an ∼10°C decrease in thermal stability for AAV2-R432A compared to wt-AAV2. In addition, the medium resolution structures revealed differences in the juxtaposition of the less ordered, N-terminal region of their capsid proteins, VP1/2/3. A structural rearrangement in AAV2-R432A repositioned the βA strand region under the icosahedral 2-fold axis rather than antiparallel to the βB strand, eliminating many intramolecular interactions. Thus, a single amino acid substitution can significantly alter the AAV capsid integrity to the extent of reducing its stability and possibly rendering it unable to tolerate the stress of genome packaging. Furthermore, the data show that the 2-, 3-, and 5-fold regions of the capsid contributed to producing the packaging defect and highlight a tight connection between the entire capsid in maintaining packaging efficiency."

In addition, the combination therapy was found to be able to increase the frequency of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3+ regulatory T cell population in rat draining lymph nodes and suppress splenic inflammatory responses. These results suggest that combination treatment with TNFR-Fc and CTLA4-FasL may achieve superior efficacy in suppressing RA, and using this novel recombinant AAV.TFCF to obtain the combined counteraction of both pathogenic T cells and the key proinflammatory cytokine TNFα may provide a more effective and desirable strategy for treatment of RA.

In order to design next-generation vectors that can evade neutralization by these antibodies, studies have mapped the epitopes of mouse monoclonal antibodies generated by immunization with AAV. Although these studies provide critical information regarding capsid immunogenicity, they cannot address (1) differences in the antibody repertoire generated in humans following AAV natural infection; or (2) how reactions can vary when generated in response to vector administration.

We used small molecule modulators of NF-κB in HeLa cells transduced with recombinant AAV vectors. VP16, an NF-κB activator, augmented AAV vector-mediated transgene expression up to 25-fold. Of the two NF-κB inhibitors, Bay11, which blocks both the canonical and the alternative NF-κB pathways, totally ablated transgene expression, whereas pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate, which interferes with the classical NF-κB pathway, had no effect. Western blot analyses confirmed the abundance of the nuclear p52 protein component of the alternative NF-κB pathway in the presence of VP16, which was ablated by Bay11, suggesting that AAV transduction activates the alternative NF-κB pathway. In vivo, hepatic AAV gene transfer activated the canonical NF-κB pathway within 2 h, resulting in expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (likely reflecting the sensing of viral particles by antigen-presenting cells), whereas the alternative pathway was activated by 9 h. Bay11 effectively blocked activation of both pathways without interfering with long-term transgene expression while eliminating proinflammatory cytokine expression. These studies suggest that transient immunosuppression with NF-κB inhibitors before transduction with AAV vectors should lead to a dampened immune response, which has significant implications in the optimal use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy."

In vivo, the preponderance of AAV vector transduction occurs in neurons where it is possible to obtain long-term, stable gene expression with very little accompanying toxicity. Promoter selection, however, significantly influences the pattern and longevity of neuronal transduction distinct from the tropism inherent to AAV vectors. AAV vectors have successfully manipulated CNS function using a wide variety of approaches including expression of foreign genes, expression of endogenous genes, expression of antisense RNA and expression of RNAi. With the discovery and characterization of different AAV serotypes, as well as the creation of novel chimeric serotypes, the potential patterns of in vivo vector transduction have been expanded substantially, offering alternatives to the more studied AAV 2 serotype. Furthermore, the development of specific AAV chimeras offers the potential to further refine targeting strategies. These different AAV serotypes also provide a solution to the immune silencing that proves to be a realistic likelihood given broad exposure of the human population to the AAV 2 serotype. These advantageous CNS properties of AAV vectors have fostered a wide range of clinically relevant applications including Parkinson's disease, lysosomal storage diseases, Canavan's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease and ALS. In many cases the proposed therapies have progressed to phase I/II clinical trials. Each individual application, however, presents a unique set of challenges that must be solved in order to attain clinically effective gene therapies."

Combined with the six antigenic sites previously elucidated for different AAV serotypes through structural approaches, including AAV1 and AAV5, this study identified two common AAV epitopes: one on the 3-fold protrusions and one on the 2/5-fold wall. These epitopes coincide with regions with the highest sequence and structure diversity between AAV serotypes and correspond to regions determining receptor recognition and transduction phenotypes. Significantly, these locations overlap the two dominant epitopes reported for autonomous parvoviruses. Thus, rather than the amino acid sequence alone, the antigenic sites of parvoviruses appear to be dictated by structural features evolved to enable specific infectious functions."

Unfortunately, the currently available antidepressants are not effective in a significant percentage of patients. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of depression must be explored at the molecular level to discover new candidate molecular targets for depression treatment. Behavioural and molecular depression-like endophenotypes have been observed in cyclic AMP response element-binding protein-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (Crtc1) knockout mice; however, the underlying mechanism for these endophenotypes remains unclear. This work investigated the role of hippocampal CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in depression using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to alter Crtc1 gene expression and explore its potential mechanism. We found that shRNA-mediated Crtc1 gene knockdown (AAV-shCRTC1) in the dentate gyrus regions of the ventral hippocampus directly resulted in depression-like behaviours and down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuropeptide VGF levels. A widely used depression model induced by lipopolysaccharide administration (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was applied in our study and was validated by increased immobility time in the tail-suspension and forced swim tests and decreased sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference test. Importantly, CRTC1 over-expression mediated by AAV-CRTC1 in the ventral dentate gyrus regions prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive-like behaviours, the down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and VGF, and the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, interleukin 1-β and tumour necrosis factor α in mice. Together, our findings indicate that CRTC1 is a key factor in depression-like behaviour and provide an important reference for finding a novel drug target in the neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic pathways for curing depressive disorders.

In this study we analysed, for the first time, HSV helper functions for productive AAV5 replication, and compared these to AAV2. Using a combination of HSV strains and plasmids for individual genes, the previously defined HSV helper functions for AAV2 replication were shown to induce AAV5 gene expression, DNA replication and production of infectious progeny. The helper functions comprise the replication genes for ICP8 (UL29), helicase-primase (UL5/8/52), and DNA polymerase (UL30/42). HSV immediate-early genes for ICP0 and ICP4 further enhanced AAV5 replication, mainly by induction of rep gene expression. In the presence of HSV helper functions, AAV5 Rep co-localized with ICP8 in nuclear replication compartments, and HSV alkaline exonuclease (UL12) enhanced AAV5 replication, similarly to AAV2. UL12, in combination with ICP8, was shown to induce DNA strand exchange on partially double-stranded templates to resolve and repair concatemeric HSV replication intermediates. Similarly, concatemeric AAV replication intermediates appeared to be processed to yield AAV unit-length molecules, ready for AAV packaging. Taken together, our findings show that productive AAV5 replication is promoted by the same combination of HSV helper functions as AAV2. "

These include the apathogenicity of the underlying wildtype viruses and the highly advanced methodologies for production of high-titer, high-purity and clinical-grade recombinant vectors(2). A further particular advantage of the AAV system over other viruses is the availability of a wealth of naturally occurring serotypes which differ in essential properties yet can all be easily engineered as vectors using a common protocol(1,2). Moreover, a number of groups including our own have recently devised strategies to use these natural viruses as templates for the creation of synthetic vectors which either combine the assets of multiple input serotypes, or which enhance the properties of a single isolate. The respective technologies to achieve these goals are either DNA family shuffling(3), i.e. fragmentation of various AAV capsid genes followed by their re-assembly based on partial homologies (typically >80% for most AAV serotypes), or peptide display(4,5), i.e. insertion of usually seven amino acids into an exposed loop of the viral capsid where the peptide ideally mediates re-targeting to a desired cell type. For maximum success, both methods are applied in a high-throughput fashion whereby the protocols are up-scaled to yield libraries of around one million distinct capsid variants. Each clone is then comprised of a unique combination of numerous parental viruses (DNA shuffling approach) or contains a distinctive peptide within the same viral backbone (peptide display approach). The subsequent final step is iterative selection of such a library on target cells in order to enrich for individual capsids fulfilling most or ideally all requirements of the selection process. The latter preferably combines positive pressure, such as growth on a certain cell type of interest, with negative selection, for instance elimination of all capsids reacting with anti-AAV antibodies. This combination increases chances that synthetic capsids surviving the selection match the needs of the given application in a manner that would probably not have been found in any naturally occurring AAV isolate. Here, we focus on the DNA family shuffling method as the theoretically and experimentally more challenging of the two technologies. We describe and demonstrate all essential steps for the generation and selection of shuffled AAV libraries (Fig. 1), and then discuss the pitfalls and critical aspects of the protocols that one needs to be aware of in order to succeed with molecular AAV evolution."

Most studies have not noted genotoxicity following AAV-mediated gene delivery; therefore, the possibility that there is an association between AAV and HCC is controversial. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of HCC in a large number of mice following therapeutic AAV gene delivery. Using a sensitive high-throughput integration site-capture technique and global expressional analysis, we found that AAV integration into the RNA imprinted and accumulated in nucleus (Rian) locus, and the resulting overexpression of proximal microRNAs and retrotransposon-like 1 (Rtl1) were associated with HCC. In addition, we demonstrated that the AAV vector dose, enhancer/promoter selection, and the timing of gene delivery are all critical factors for determining HCC incidence after AAV gene delivery. Together, our results define aspects of AAV-mediated gene therapy that influence genotoxicity and suggest that these features should be considered for design of both safer AAV vectors and gene therapy studies.

Specifically, for cardiovascular gene therapy, rAAVs appear superior to other vector systems such as lenti- and adenoviral vectors due to the ease of accomplishing long-term cardiac expression of target genes and the reduced risk of provoking immune responses or triggering malignancies through genomic integration. However, major obstacles remain to be resolved if rAAVs are to achieve their full potential as gene therapy vectors in clinical trials.

However, vector doses needed to achieve therapeutic effect are high and some target tissues in the central nervous system remain difficult to transduce. Gene therapy trials using AAV for the treatment of neurological disorders have seldom led to demonstrated clinical efficacy. Important contributing factors are low transduction rates and inefficient distribution of the vector. To overcome these hurdles, a variety of capsid engineering methods have been utilized to generate capsids with improved transduction properties. Here we describe an alternative approach to capsid engineering, which draws on the natural evolution of the virus and aims to yield capsids that are better suited to infect human tissues. We generated an AAV capsid to include amino acids that are conserved among natural AAV2 isolates and tested its biodistribution properties in mice and rats. Intriguingly, this novel variant, AAV-TT, demonstrates strong neurotropism in rodents and displays significantly improved distribution throughout the central nervous system as compared to AAV2. Additionally, sub-retinal injections in mice revealed markedly enhanced transduction of photoreceptor cells when compared to AAV2. Importantly, AAV-TT exceeds the distribution abilities of benchmark neurotropic serotypes AAV9 and AAVrh10 in the central nervous system of mice, and is the only virus, when administered at low dose, that is able to correct the neurological phenotype in a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC, a transmembrane enzyme lysosomal storage disease, which requires delivery to every cell for biochemical correction. These data represent unprecedented correction of a lysosomal transmembrane enzyme deficiency in mice and suggest that AAV-TT-based gene therapies may be suitable for treatment of human neurological diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC, which is characterized by global neuropathology."

For healthy subjects, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9 was 36.5%, 35.3%, 37.6%, 32.9%, and 36.5%, respectively, while that in hemophilia patients was 39.7%, 28.8%, 35.6%, 32.9%, and 27.4%, respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of neutralizing antibody against each AAV serotype between the healthy subjects and the hemophilia patients. The prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against all AAV serotypes increased with age in both healthy subjects and hemophilia patients. High titers of neutralizing antibodies against AAV2 (≥1:224) and AAV8 (≥1:224) were more evident in older individuals (≥42 years old). Approximately 50% of all screened individuals were seronegative for neutralizing antibodies against each AAV tested, while approximately 25% of individuals were seropositive for each AAV serotype tested. The prevalence of seronegativity for all AAV serotypes was 67.0% (healthy subjects, 68.6%; hemophilia patients, 65.0%) and 18.6% (healthy subjects, 20.5%; hemophilia patients, 15.7%) in young (<42 years old) and older subjects (≥42 years old), respectively. The findings from this study suggested that young subjects are more likely to be eligible for gene therapy based on AAV vectors delivered via an intravascular route because of the low prevalence of antibodies to AAV capsids."

However, its broad host tropism and lack of tissue specificity have limited clinical applications such as cancer therapy. Therefore, redirecting the natural tropism of AAV vectors to unique cell surface antigens is an important requirement for in vivo RNAi-based cancer therapy. To use the overexpression property of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in specific cancer types, we herein created anti-EpCAM antibody-conjugated AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) vectors through a streptavidin-biotin bridge. Upon intravenous injection, anti-EpCAM-conjugated AAV2 vectors showed prominent tumor-specific accumulation in EpCAM-positive tumor-bearing mice without undesirable sequestration in liver. In addition, when loaded with transgenes to express shRNA against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), systemically injected anti-EpCAM-conjugated AAV2/shEGFR vectors induced significant downregulation of EGFR expression in tumors and eventually suppressed tumor growth even at the long dosing interval of two weeks. This in vivo antitumor effect represents the increased infection efficacy of tropism-modified AAV2 vectors and prolonged expression of EGFR shRNA in tumor tissues. Thus, this study suggests the great potential of anti-EpCAM-conjugated AAV2/shEGFR vectors as RNAi-based cancer therapeutics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vector for systemic delivery of siRNA, but its broad host tropism has limited clinical applications. By using the overexpression property of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on tumors, we demonstrate that anti-EpCAM-conjugated AAV2 vectors through a streptavidin-biotin bridge are redirected to EpCAM-positive tumors in vivo. In addition, when loaded with transgenes to express shRNA against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), systemically injected anti-EpCAM-conjugated AAV2/shEGFR vectors significantly downregulate EGFR expression in tumors, eventually suppressing tumor growth for long periods. We herein suggest the potential of anti-EpCAM-AAV2/shEGFR vectors as an antitumor agent. Furthermore, redirection of AAV2 infection through EpCAM would provide a powerful means for systemic delivery of short hairpin RNA to tumor sites."

Recent studies have indicated that antibodies with high affinity for Meth reduce its pharmacological effects. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique for virus-based passive immunization against Meth effects. We generated a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype-8 vector (AAV-MethAb) carrying the gene for a Meth-specific monoclonal antibody (MethAb). Infection of 293 cells with AAV-MethAb resulted in the expression and secretion of antibodies which bind to Meth. The viral vector was then examined in adult ICR mice. Systemic administration of AAV-MethAb resulted in long-term expression of MethAb in the serum for up to 29 weeks. Serum collected from the animals receiving AAV-MethAb retained a high specificity for (+)-Meth. Animals were challenged with Meth five weeks after viral injection. Meth levels in the brain and serum were reduced while Meth-induced locomotor activity was significantly attenuated. In conclusion, AAV-MethAb administration effectively depletes Meth from brain and serum while reducing the behavioral response to Meth, and thus is a potential therapeutic approach for Meth abuse."

AAV serotypes, promoters and routes of administration potentially influencing the efficiency of gene transfer to airway cells were examined in the present study. Among the nine AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) screened in vitro and four serotypes (AAV1, 2, 6, 9) evaluated in vivo, AAV6 showed the strongest transgene expression. As for promoters, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter resulted in more robust transduction than the CMV promoter. Regarding delivery routes, intratracheal administration resulted in strong transgene expression in the lung, whereas the intravenous and intranasal administration routes yielded negligible expression. The combination of the AAV6 capsid and CAG promoter resulted in sustained expression, and the intratracheally administered AAV6-CAG vector transduced bronchial cells and pericytes in the lung. These results suggest that AAV6-CAG vectors are more promising than the previously preferred AAV2 vectors for airway transduction, particularly when administered into the trachea. The present study offers an optimized strategy for AAV-mediated gene therapy for lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis."

We offer the development of a nanovector-based solution that will reduce the incidence of lung ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) leading to graft organ failure through the successful ex vivo treatment of the lung prior to transplantation. The innovation is in the integrated application of our novel porous silicon (pSi) microparticles carrying adeno-associated virus (AAV) nanoparticles, and the use of our ex vivo lung perfusion/ventilation system for the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines initiated by ischemic pulmonary conditions prior to organ transplant that often lead to complications. Gene delivery of anti-inflammatory agents to combat the inflammatory cascade may be a promising approach to prevent IRI following lung transplantation. The rationale for the device is that the microparticle will deliver a large payload of virus to cells and serve to protect the AAV from immune recognition. The microparticle-nanoparticle hybrid device was tested both in vitro on cell monolayers and ex vivo using either porcine venous tissue or a pig lung transplantation model, which recapitulates pulmonary IRI that occurs clinically post-transplantation. Remarkably, loading AAV vectors into pSi microparticles increases gene delivery to otherwise non-permissive endothelial cells. "

AAV-DJ is a recombinant AAV generated by the gene shuffling of various AAV serotypes and shares characteristics of AAV2 and AAV8. AAV-DJ contains a heparin-binding domain in its capsid, which suggests that a heparin column could be used for the purification of the AAV. Given that AAV-DJ has been only recently available, relatively little is known about the optimal preparation/purification and application of AAV-DJ.

Thanks to these features, the use of AAV vectors as a gene transfer tool has increased dramatically during the past several years, and several recent clinical trials have used AAV vectors. However, AAV vectors are more complicated to produce than are other viral vectors.

To date, most AAV-based studies use constitutively active promoters (e.g., the CMV promoter) to drive transgene expression, which often hampers efficient AAV production due to cytotoxic, antiproliferative, or unknown transgene effects interfering with producer cell performance. Therefore, we explored artificial riboswitches as novel tools to control transgene expression during AAV production in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that the guanine-responsive GuaM8HDV aptazyme efficiently attenuates transgene expression and associated detrimental effects, thereby boosting AAV vector yields up to 23-fold after a single addition of guanine. Importantly, riboswitch-harboring vectors preserved their ability to express functional transgene at high levels in the absence of ligand, as demonstrated in a mouse model of AAV-TGFβ1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, our study provides the first application-ready biotechnological system-based on aptazymes, which should enable high viral vector yields largely independent of the transgene used. Moreover, the RNA-intrinsic, small-molecule regulatable mode of action of riboswitches provides key advantages over conventional transcription factor-based regulatory systems. Therefore, such riboswitch vectors might be ultimately applied to temporally control therapeutic transgene expression in vivo. "

The D-sequence was also shown to specifically interact with the regulatory factor binding to the X-box (RFX), binding of which to the X-box is a critical step in the MHC-II gene expression, suggesting that D-sequence might compete for RFX transcription factor binding, thereby suppressing expression from the MHC-II promoter. In DNA-mediated transfection experiments, using a reporter gene under the control of the HLA-DRA promoter, D-sequence oligonucleotides were found to inhibit expression of the reporter gene expression in HeLa and 293 cells by ∼93% and 96%, respectively.

This information is crucial, since bone pain, including cancer-induced bone pain, is an area of high importance in pain biology. In this study, we found that AAVrh10 transduces neurons in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia of immunodeficient mice with higher efficacy than AAV2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 when injected intrathecally. Additionally, AAVrh10 has tropism towards sensory neurons in skeletal tissue, such as bone marrow and periosteum, while it occasionally reaches the sensory nerve fibers in the mouse footpad.

We previously found that Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) reduced photoreceptor loss in the S334ter-3 and Royal College of Surgeons rat models of retinal degeneration. The results were attributed in part to a reduction in oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that long-term delivery of STC-1 would provide therapeutic rescue in more chronic models of retinal degeneration.

To control the expression of STC-1 in hypoxia, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) to mediate hypoxia induction. Cardiomyocytes were infected with AAV-HRE-STC-1 and cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and STC-1 overexpression was only detected in hypoxic cultured cardiomyocytes by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, AAV-HRE-STC-1 infection was shown to significantly enhance cell survival under hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis was inhibited by AAV-HRE-STC-1 infection by using the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide apoptosis assay. Moreover, the proapoptotic protein Caspase-3 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which were dysregulated by hypoxia, were reversed by AAV-HRE-STC-1 infection.

Early animal studies did not predict the full range of host immunity to the AAV vector in human studies. While pre-existing antibody titers against AAV vectors has been a lingering concern, cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses against the input capsid can prevent long-term therapy in humans. These discoveries spawned more thorough profiling of immune response to rAAV in pre-clinical models, which have assessed both innate and adaptive immunity and explored methods for bypassing these responses. Many efforts toward measuring innate immunity have utilized Toll-like receptor deficient models and have focused on differential responses to viral capsid and genome. From adaptive studies, it is clear that humoral responses are relevant for initial vector transduction efficiency while cellular responses impact long-term outcomes of gene transfer. Measuring humoral responses to AAV vectors has utilized in vitro neutralizing antibody assays and transfer of seropositive serum to immunodeficient mice. Overcoming antibodies using CD20 inhibitors, plasmapheresis, altering route of delivery and using different capsids have been explored. CTL responses were measured using in vitro and in vivo models. In in vitro assays expansion of antigen-specific T-cells as well as cytotoxicity toward AAV transduced cells can be shown. Many groups have successfully mimicked antigen-specific T-cell proliferation, but actual transgene level reduction and parameters of cytotoxicity toward transduced target cells have only been shown in one model. The model utilized adoptive transfer of capsid-specific in vitro expanded T-cells isolated from immunized mice with LPS as an adjuvant. Finally, the development of immune tolerance to AAV vectors by enriching regulatory T-cells as well as modulating the response pharmacologically has also been explored. "

Based on the AAV genome, we constructed an AAV-ITR ssDNA minivector that consists of a GFP expression cassette flanked by both ITR sequences of 125 nucleotides. The minivectors were produced by digestion of the parental plasmids followed by denaturation. The self-complementary inverted T-shaped HP structure of the minivector was automatically formed. The HEK 293T cells were transfected with the AAV-ITR ssDNA minivector, plasmid, and dsDNA expression cassette. The results showed that AAV-ITR ssDNA minivector had relatively low gene expression efficiency in vitro. However, we found that the GFP expression efficiency of the D sequence-deleted AAV-ITR ssDNA minivector was significantly increased and was similar to those obtained with the plasmid and dsDNA expression cassette. Our data suggest that the AAV-ITR ssDNA minivector may be a new type of gene expression vector for gene therapy besides the virus and plasmid. "

When multiple serotypes are handled in the same laboratory during the AAV vector production, it is essential to have means to identify the serotype in a sample and to confirm the absence of cross-contaminating AAV sequences in plasmid stocks as well as end products. Here, we describe the development of a Multiplex AAV Genotyping (MAG) assay to type sensitively and specifically DNA from AAV serotypes 1-12 and to detect AAV2 serotype DNA sequences encoding peptide insertions used to modify tissue tropism. MAG is based on multiplex PCR using type-specific primers and subsequent multiplex hybridization by Luminex. The assay is highly specific, and can easily identify plasmid cross-contaminations. Using 10-fold dilution series, the detection limit was below 10 AAV genomes per PCR. In artificial cross-contamination experiments with a 1,000-fold excess of one AAV serotype versus another one, the contaminating type could be still detected with 10-100 AAV genomes. In a first application, MAG identified successfully cross-contaminated AAV plasmid stocks. In conclusion, MAG is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing the purity and identity of AAV DNA plasmids and other starting materials used for AAV vector production."

These differences are not due to differences in the intrinsic activating capability of the individual Rep proteins. Both viral promoters contain AP1 and CRE elements that contribute to their basal activity; however, the nature of the B-AAV P41 promoter itself and the surrounding sequences contribute to its relatively lower basal activity. In addition, the B-AAV upstream transcription units themselves also are activated in the presence of Ad5 and Rep. Thus, although the transcription map of B-AAV is much more closely related to AAV5, activation of its promoters is functionally more like the prototype AAV2."

Fresh specific pathogen-free fertilized chicken eggs were randomly divided into a rAAV-CGRP group, an empty vector virus (AAV) group, and a control group, with 24 eggs in each group. An umbilical arterial vasospasm model was established using a needle puncture method on a vein in the chorioallantoic membrane to induce a hemorrhage in the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old chicken embryonated eggs. A total of 24 h after model establishment, 1 ml of rAAV-CGRP and empty vector virus solution of rAAV-CGRP and empty vector virus solution was, respectively, injected into the allantoic cavity in the rAAV-CGRP and AAV groups. Experimental results showed that after 72 h of model establishment, the mortality rates of the 3-, 5- and 7-day subgroups in the rAAV-CGRP group were lower than in the subgroups of the AAV injection group. After 3, 5 and 7 days of model establishment in the rAAV-CGRP group, the cross-sectional area of the inner diameter of the umbilical arteries was larger than that of the AAV group; the vessel wall thicknesses of the rAAV-CGRP group were thinner than in the AAV group. In addition, the concentration of CGRP in chick embryo allantoic fluid significantly increased and was several times higher than in the AAV group (P<0.05). In conclusion, administration of rAAV-CGRP through the allantoic cavity may increase the viability of a vasospasm model induced by chick allantoic cavity hemorrhage, significantly improve umbilical artery vasospasm, and increase CGRP expression in the chick embryo allantoic cavity. This approach also provides a novel experimental model for identifying other target genes for the gene therapy of vasospasm."

Here, we incorporated a site-specific tetracysteine sequence into the AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid, to permit labelling of viral particles with either a fluorescent dye or biotin. We demonstrate that fluorescently labelled particles are detectable in vitro, and explore the utility of the method in vivo in mice with time-lapse imaging. We exploit the biotinylated viral particles to generate two distinct AAV interactomes, and identify several functional classes of proteins that are highly represented: actin/cytoskeletal protein binding, RNA binding, RNA splicing/processing, chromatin modifying, intracellular trafficking and RNA transport proteins. To examine the biological relevance of the capsid interactome, we modulated the expression of two proteins from the interactomes prior to AAV transduction. Blocking integrin αVβ6 receptor function reduced AAV9 transduction, while reducing histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) expression enhanced AAV transduction. Our method demonstrates a strategy for inserting motifs into the AAV capsid without compromising viral titer or infectivity."

Here, we show that, although antibodies binding known AAV serotypes (AAV1 to AAV11) are prevalent in cats living in the Northeastern United States, these antibodies do not necessarily neutralize AAV infectivity. We analyzed sera from 35 client-owned, 20 feral, and 30 specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats for pre-existing AAV-binding antibodies against the 11 serotypes. Antibody prevalence was 7 to 90% with an overall median of 50%. The AAV-binding antibodies showed broad reactivities with other serotypes. Of 44 selected antibodies binding AAV2, AAV6 or AAV9, none exhibited appreciable neutralizing activities. Instead, AAV6 or AAV9-binding antibodies showed a transduction-enhancing effect. AAV6-binding antibodies were highly prevalent in SPF cats (83%), but this was primarily due to cross-reactivity with preventive vaccine-induced anti-feline panleukopenia virus antibodies. These results indicate that prevalent pre-existing immunity in cats is not necessarily inhibitory to AAV and highlight a substantial difference in the nature of AAV-binding antibodies in cats living in geographically different regions."

As AAV2 was shown to transduce only small volumes in several brain regions, this study compares the transduction efficiency of three AAV pseudotyped vectors, namely AAV2/1, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). No difference was found between AAV2/1 and AAV2/5 in transduction efficiency. Both AAV2/1 and AAV2/5 achieved a higher transduction rate than AAV2/8. One hour after virus administration to the brain, no viral particles could be traced in blood, indicating that no or negligible numbers of virions crossed the blood-brain barrier. In order to investigate survival of AAV in blood, clearance was determined following systemic AAV administration. The half-life of AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8 was calculated by determining virus clearance rates from blood after systemic injection. The half-life of AAV2/2 was 4.2 minutes, which was significantly lower than the half-lives of AAV2/1, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8. With a half-life of more than 11 hours, AAV2/8 particles remained detectable in blood significantly longer than AAV2/5. We conclude that application of AAV in the CNS is relatively safe as no AAV particles are detectable in blood after injection into the brain. With a half-life of 1.67 hours of AAV2/5, a systemic injection with 1×109 genomic copies of AAV would be fully cleared from blood after 2 days. "

To assess if these HUH domains could be interchanged, we created a chimeric protein from two distantly related HUH endonucleases, containing the N-terminal HUH domain of the bacterial conjugative relaxase TrwC and the C-terminal DNA helicase domain of the human adeno-associated virus (AAV) replicase and site-specific integrase.

Interestingly, the chimeric protein could catalyse site-specific integration in bacteria with an efficiency comparable to that of TrwC, while the HUH domain of TrwC alone was unable to catalyze this reaction, implying that the Rep68 C-terminal helicase domain is complementing the TrwC HUH domain to achieve site-specific integration into TrwC targets in bacteria. Our results illustrate how HUH domains could have acquired through evolution other domains in order to attain new roles, contributing to the functional flexibility observed in this protein superfamily."

When different AAV capsids packaging ss/scDNA varying in length from 72 to 123% of wild-type DNA (3.4 to 5.8 kb) were incrementally heated, the proportion of uncoated AAV capsids decreased with genome length as observed by EM. Genome release was further characterized by a fluorimetric assay, which demonstrated that acidic pH and high osmotic pressure suppress genome release from AAV particles. In addition, fluorimetric analysis corroborated an inverse correlation between packaged genome length and the temperature needed to induce uncoating. Surprisingly, scAAV vectors required significantly higher temperatures to uncoat than their ssDNA-packaging counterparts. However, externalization of VP1 N termini appears to be unaffected by packaged genome length or self-complementarity. Further analysis by tungsten-shadowing EM revealed striking differences in the morphologies of ssDNA and scDNA genomes upon release from intact capsids. Computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the unusual thermal stability of scAAV vectors might arise from partial base pairing and optimal organization of packaged scDNA.

To minimize the bias and limitation of in vitro screening on culture cells, we performed direct in vivo panning in adult mice after intravenous injection of the shuffled capsid library that packaged their own coding sequences. The AAV variants enriched in the heart and muscle are retrieved by capsid gene PCR and subsequently characterized for their tissue tropisms. This directed evolution and in vivo selection method should be useful in generating novel gene therapy vectors for muscle and heart and other tissues."

Using multiple particle tracking, we found that sputum strongly impeded diffusion of AAV, regardless of serotype, by adhesive interactions and steric obstruction. Approximately 50% of AAV vectors diffused >1,000-fold more slowly in sputum than in water, with large patient-to-patient variation. We thus tested two strategies to improve AAV diffusion in sputum. We showed that an AAV2 mutant engineered to have reduced heparin binding diffused twice as fast as AAV2 on average, presumably because of reduced adhesion to sputum. We also discovered that the mucolytic N-acetylcysteine could markedly enhance AAV diffusion by altering the sputum microstructure.

First, we genetically encode small targeting scaffolds into a variable region of an AAV capsid and show that this redirects tropism toward the receptor recognized by these targeting scaffolds and also renders this AAV variant resistant to neutralizing antibodies present in nonhuman primate serum. We then simplify retargeting of tropism by engineering the same variable loop to encode a HUH tag, which forms a covalent bond to single-stranded DNA oligos conjugated to store-bought antibodies. We demonstrate that retargeting this HUH-AAVs toward different receptors is as simple as ""arming"" a premade noninfective AAV template with a different antibody in a conjugation process that uses widely available reagents and requires no optimization or extensive purification. Composite antibody-AAV nanoparticles structurally separate tropism and payload encapsulation, allowing each to be engineered independently."

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is an optimistic strategy that involves the delivery of genetic material to target human diseases through gene augmentation, gene deletion, and/or gene editing. With two therapies already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and 200 ongoing clinical trials, recombinant AAV (rAAV) has emerged as the in vivo viral vector-of-choice to deliver genetic material to target human diseases. Likewise, the relative ease of applications through targeted delivery and its compartmental nature makes the cornea an enticing tissue for AAV mediated gene therapy applications. This current review seeks to summarize the development of AAV gene therapy, highlight preclinical efficacy studies, and discuss potential applications and challenges of this technology for targeting corneal diseases."

These problems become even more critical when considering the application of viral vectors in human gene therapy and gene therapy trials. In a previous study, we were able to show that the hydrodynamics-based gene transfer of plasmid-DNA, containing the adeno-associated-virus specific inverted terminal repeats (AAV-ITR), prolongs gene expression in the liver, although it remained unclear whether plasmid gene transfer could achieve similar expression levels compared to viral-vector gene transfer."

DMD is a severe muscle-wasting disorder caused by DMD gene mutations leading to complete loss of dystrophin protein. One of the major issues associated with delivery of the DMD gene, as a therapeutic approach for DMD, is its large open reading frame (ORF; 11.1 kb). A series of truncated microdystrophin cDNAs (delivered via a single AAV) and minidystrophin cDNAs (delivered via dual-AAV trans-spliced/overlapping reconstitution) have thus been extensively tested in DMD animal models. However, critical rod and hinge domains of dystrophin required for interaction with components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase, syntrophin, and dystrobrevin, are missing; these dystrophin domains may still need to be incorporated to increase dystrophin functionality and stabilize membrane rigidity. Full-length DMD gene delivery using AAV vectors remains elusive because of the limited single-AAV packaging capacity (4.7 kb). Here we developed a novel method for the delivery of the full-length DMD coding sequence to skeletal muscles in dystrophic mdx mice using a triple-AAV trans-splicing vector system. We report for the first time that three independent AAV vectors carrying ""in tandem"" sequential exonic parts of the human DMD coding sequence enable the expression of the full-length protein as a result of trans-splicing events cojoining three vectors via their inverted terminal repeat sequences. This method of triple-AAV-mediated trans-splicing could be applicable to the delivery of any large therapeutic gene (≥11 kb ORF) into postmitotic tissues (muscles or neurons) for the treatment of various inherited metabolic and genetic diseases."

Recombinant AAV vectors contain minimum viral proteins necessary for their assembly and gene delivery functions. During the process of AAV assembly and production, AAV vectors acquire, inherently and submissively, various cellular proteins, but the identity of these proteins is poorly characterized. We reason that by identifying host cell proteins inherently associated with AAV vectors we may better understand the contribution of cellular components to AAV vector assembly and, ultimately, may improve the production of AAV vectors for gene therapy. In this study, three serotypes of recombinant AAV, namely AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8, were investigated. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods to identify protein composition in purified AAV vectors, confirmed protein identities using western blotting, and explored the potential function of selected proteins in AAV vector production using small hairpin (shRNA) methods. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified 44 AAV-associated cellular proteins including Y-box binding protein (YB1). We showed for the first time that the establishment of a novel producer cell line by introducing an shRNA sequence down-regulating YB1 resulted in up to 45- and 9-fold increase in physical vector genome titers of AAV2 and AAV8, respectively, and up to 7-fold increase in AAV2 transduction vector genome titers. Our results revealed that YB1 gene knockdown promoted AAV2 rep expression and vector DNA production and reduced the number of empty particles in AAV2 products, suggesting that YB1 plays an important role in AAV vector assembly by competition with adenovirus E2A and AAV capsid proteins for binding to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequence. The significance and implications of our findings in future improvement of AAV production are discussed."

Currently, delivery of adequate levels of gene expression is a limiting step for this approach. The synthetic AAV capsid and promoter described here achieves high level of optogenetic transgene expression in ON-bipolar cells.

Plasmapheresis has been proposed as strategy to remove anti-AAV antibodies from the bloodstream. Although safe and relatively effective, the technology has some limitations mainly related to the nonspecific removal of all circulating IgG. Here we developed an AAV-specific plasmapheresis column which was shown to efficiently and selectively deplete anti-AAV antibodies without depleting the total immunoglobulin pool from plasma. We showed the nearly complete removal of anti-AAV antibodies from high titer purified human IgG pools and plasma samples, decreasing titers to levels that allow AAV vector administration in mice. These results provide proof-of-concept of a method for the AAV-specific depletion of neutralizing antibodies in the setting of in vivo gene transfer."

Earlier studies have established this tripeptide motif as being essential for integrin-mediated uptake of recombinant AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) in cultured cells. However, functional attributes of this putative integrin recognition motif in other recombinant AAV serotypes displaying systemic transduction in vivo remain unknown. In this study, we dissect the biology of an integrin domain capsid mutant derived from the human isolate AAV9 in mice. The AAV9/NGA mutant shows decreased systemic transduction in mice. This defective phenotype was accompanied by rapid clearance of mutant virions from the blood circulation and nonspecific sequestration by the spleen. Transient vascular hyperpermeability, induced by histamine coinjection, exacerbated AAV9/NGA uptake by the spleen but not the liver. However, such treatment did not affect AAV9 virions, suggesting a potential entry/post-entry defect for the mutant in different tissues. Further characterization revealed modestly decreased cell surface binding but a more pronounced defect in the cellular entry of mutant virions. These findings were corroborated by the observation that blocking multiple integrins adversely affected recombinant AAV9 transduction in different cell types, albeit with variable efficiencies. From a structural perspective, we observed that the integrin recognition motif is located in close proximity to the galactose binding footprint on AAV9 capsids and postulate that this feature could influence cell surface attachment, cellular uptake at the tissue level, and systemic clearance by the reticuloendothelial system.

The large Rep proteins, Rep78 and Rep68, are remarkably multifunctional and display a range of biochemical activities, including DNA binding, nicking, and unwinding. Functionally, Rep78 and Rep68 are involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and genomic integration. Structurally, the Rep proteins share an AAA(+) domain characteristic of superfamily 3 helicases, with the large Rep proteins additionally containing an N-terminal origin-binding domain (OBD) that specifically binds and nicks DNA. The combination of these domains, coupled with dynamic oligomerization properties, is the basis for the remarkable multifunctionality displayed by Rep68 and Rep78 during the AAV life cycle. In this report, we describe an oligomeric interface formed by Rep68 and demonstrate how disruption of this interface has drastic effects on both the oligomerization and functionality of the Rep proteins. Our results support a role for the four-helix bundle in the helicase domain of Rep68 as a bona fide oligomerization domain (OD). We have identified key residues in the OD that are critical for the stabilization of the Rep68-Rep68 interface; mutation of these key residues disrupts the enzymatic activities of Rep68, including DNA binding and nicking, and compromises viral DNA replication and transcriptional regulation of the viral promoters. Taken together, our data contribute to our understanding of the dynamic and substrate-responsive Rep78/68 oligomerization that is instrumental in the regulation of the DNA transitions that take place during the AAV life cycle."

Here we report safe and bodywide AAV delivery in juvenile DMD dogs. Three ∼2-m-old affected dogs received intravenous injection of a tyrosine-engineered AAV-9 reporter or micro-dystrophin (μDys) vector at the doses of 1.92-6.24 × 10(14) viral genome particles/kg under transient or sustained immune suppression.

Widespread muscle transduction was seen in skeletal muscle, the diaphragm and heart for at least 4 months (the end of the study). Nominal expression was detected in internal organs. Improvement in muscle histology was observed in μDys-treated dogs. In summary, systemic AAV gene transfer is safe and efficient in young adult dystrophic large mammals.

Moreover, SSCs that were infected in fresh testis cells generated normal appearing spermatogenic colonies after spermatogonial transplantation. A microinsemination experiment produced offspring that underwent excision of the floxed target gene by AAV1-mediated Cre expression. Analysis of the offspring DNA showed no evidence of AAV integration, suggesting a low risk of germline integration by AAV infection. Although more extensive experiments are required to assess the risk of germline integration, our results show that AAV1 is useful for genetic manipulation of SSCs, and gene transduction by AAV will provide a useful approach to overcome potential problems associated with previous virus vector-mediated gene transduction."

Current treatments for this disease are ineffective in treating central nervous system (CNS) disease due to the inability of lysosomal enzymes to traverse the blood-brain barrier. A noninvasive and effective approach was taken in the treatment of CNS disease by intranasal administration of an IDUA-encoding adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector. Adult IDUA-deficient mice aged 3 months were instilled intranasally with AAV9-IDUA vector. Animals sacrificed 5 months post instillation exhibited IDUA enzyme activity levels that were up to 50-fold that of wild-type mice in the olfactory bulb, with wild-type levels of enzyme restored in all other parts of the brain. Intranasal treatment with AAV9-IDUA also resulted in the reduction of tissue glycosaminoglycan storage materials in the brain. There was strong IDUA immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections observed in the nasal epithelium and olfactory bulb, but there was no evidence of the presence of transduced cells in other portions of the brain. This indicates that reduction of storage materials most likely occurred as a result of enzyme diffusion from the olfactory bulb and the nasal epithelium into deeper areas of the brain. At 8 months of age, neurocognitive testing using the Barnes maze to assess spatial navigation demonstrated that treated IDUA-deficient mice were no different from normal control animals, while untreated IDUA-deficient mice exhibited significant learning and navigation deficits. This novel, noninvasive strategy for intranasal AAV9-IDUA instillation could potentially be used to treat CNS manifestations of human MPS I."

As adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV-9) transduces skeletal muscle at high efficiency following systemic delivery, we employed AAV-9 vectors bearing luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter genes to test the hypothesis that increased desialylation of cell-surface glycans secondary to hindlimb ischemia (HLI) might help offset the reduction in tissue perfusion that occurs in mouse models of PAD. The utility of the creatine kinase-based (CK6) promoter for restricting gene expression to the skeletal muscle was also examined by comparing it with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter after systemic administration following surgically induced HLI. Despite reduced blood flow to the ischemic limbs, CK6 promoter-driven luciferase activities in the ischemic gastrocnemius (GA) muscles were ∼34-, ∼28- and ∼150-fold higher than in the fully perfused contralateral GA, heart and liver, respectively, 10 days after IV administration. Furthermore, luciferase activity from the CK6 promoter in the ischemic GA muscles was ∼twofold higher than with CMV, while in the liver CK6-driven activity was ∼42-fold lower than with CMV, demonstrating that the specificity of ischemic skeletal muscle transduction can be further improved with the muscle-specific promoters. Studies with Evans blue dye and fluorescently labeled lectins revealed that vascular permeability and desialylation of the cell-surface glycans were increased in the ischemic hindlimbs. Furthermore, AAV9/CK6/Luc vector genome copy numbers were ∼sixfold higher in the ischemic muscle compared with the non-ischemic muscle in the HLI model, whereas this trend was reversed when the same genome was packaged in the AAV-1 capsid (which binds sialylated, as opposed to desialylated glycans), further underscoring the importance of desialylation in the ischemic enhancement of transduction displayed by AAV-9. Taken together, these findings suggest two complementary mechanisms contributing to the preferential transduction of ischemic muscle by AAV-9: increased vascular permeability and desialylation. In conclusion, ischemic muscle is preferentially targeted following systemic administration of AAV-9 in a mouse model of HLI. Unmasking of the primary AAV-9 receptor as a result of ischemia may contribute importantly to this effect."

Despite this progress, vector integrity following production is often overlooked. Compromised vectors may negatively impact therapeutic efficacy and safety. Using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing, we can comprehensively profile packaged genomes as a single intact molecule and directly assess vector integrity without extensive preparation. We have exploited this methodology to profile all heterogeneic populations of self-complementary AAV genomes via bioinformatics pipelines and have coined this approach AAV-genome population sequencing (AAV-GPseq). The approach can reveal the relative distribution of truncated genomes versus full-length genomes in vector preparations. Preparations that seemingly show high genome homogeneity by gel electrophoresis are revealed to consist of less than 50% full-length species. With AAV-GPseq, we can also detect many reverse-packaged genomes that encompass sequences originating from plasmid backbone, as well as sequences from packaging and helper plasmids. Finally, we detect host-cell genomic sequences that are chimeric with inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-containing vector sequences. We show that vector populations can contain between 1.3% and 2.3% of this type of undesirable genome. These discoveries redefine quality control standards for viral vector preparations and highlight the degree of foreign products in rAAV-based therapeutic vectors."

To elucidate the strategy of AAV replication in the presence of HSV-1, we undertook a proteomic analysis of cellular and HSV-1 factors associated with Rep proteins and thus potentially recruited within AAV replication compartments (AAV RCs). This study resulted in the identification of approximately 60 cellular proteins, among which factors involved in DNA and RNA metabolism represented the largest functional categories. Validation analyses indicated that the cellular DNA replication enzymes RPA, RFC, and PCNA were recruited within HSV-1-induced AAV RCs. Polymerase delta was not identified but subsequently was shown to colocalize with Rep within AAV RCs even in the presence of the HSV-1 polymerase complex. In addition, we found that AAV replication is associated with the recruitment of components of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex, Ku70 and -86, and the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, -3, and -6. Finally, several HSV-1 factors were also found to be associated with Rep, including UL12. We demonstrated for the first time that this protein plays a role during AAV replication by enhancing the resolution of AAV replicative forms and AAV particle production. Altogether, these analyses provide the basis to understand how AAV adapts its replication strategy to the nuclear environment induced by the helper virus."

Surprisingly, very little data exists on AAV-induced changes to the cellular microRNAome in general and in hepatic and retinal cells, in particular. We reasoned that inducible microRNA in response to recombinant AAV infection may regulate immediate and long-lived cellular responses necessary for the cell's own survival as well as its ability to control several aspects of viral life-cycle. To study this, we performed a global small RNA sequencing analysis in Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 2 and 3 infected hepatic and retinal cell models. This screen identified multiple differentially expressed microRNAs, in AAV infected Huh-7 and ARPE-19 cells. Among these, one microRNA (miR-4488) was found to be significantly down regulated (-2.24 fold for AAV2 and -3.32 fold for ARPE-19) in AAV infected cells. An enrichment and pathway analysis of miR-4488 predicted its possible effects on gene targets involved in multiple biological processes including cell-cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and lipid-signalling pathways. Moreover, validation studies in miR-4488 mimic or sponge transfected cells revealed modulation of these target pathways in a cell-specific manner. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of miR-4488, modestly increased gene expression (126-128%) from AAV2 and AAV3 vectors in Huh-7 cells whereas miR-4488 inhibition in ARPE-19 cells had a similar increase (142-158%) on AAV2 or AAV3 transduction.

Consequently, long-term transgene expression from AAV is best suited for quiescent cell types, such as retinal cells, myocytes, or neurons. For genetic diseases that involve cells with steady turnover, AAV-conferred correction may require routine readministration, where every dose carries the risk of developing an adaptive immune response that renders treatment ineffective. Here, we discuss innovative approaches to permanently modify the host genome using AAV-based platforms, thus potentially requiring only a single dose. Such approaches include using AAV delivery of DNA transposons, homologous recombination templates into safe harbors, and nucleases for targeting integration. In tissues with continual cell turnover, genetic modification of progenitor cell populations will help ensure persistent therapeutic outcomes. Combining the safety profile of AAV-based gene therapy vectors with the ability to integrate a therapeutic transgene creates novel solutions to the challenge of lifelong curative treatments for human genetic diseases."

A high dose of an adeno-associated virus encoding IFNα (AAV-IFNα) was able to eradicate a liver metastases model of colon cancer but induced lethal pancytopenia. On the other hand, a safe dose of AAV-IFNα was not able to eliminate the liver metastases of colon cancer. In this IFNα-resistant tumor model, administration of an adeno-associated vector encoding apolipoprotein A-1 fused to IFNα was able to fully eradicate the tumor in 43% of mice without toxicity. This antitumor effect was limited by suboptimal long-term CD8+ T cell activation and the expansion of T regulatory cells. In contrast, IFNα upregulated suppressor molecules such as PD-1 and interleukin 10 on CD8+ T lymphocytes.

Light is an attractive stimulus because it does not cross-react with cellular signaling networks, has negligible toxicity, is noninvasive, and can be applied in space and time with unparalleled precision. We used the previously engineered red (R)/far-red (FR) light-switchable protein phytochrome B (PhyB) and its R light dependent interaction partner phytochrome interacting factor 6 (PIF6) from Arabidopsis thaliana to engineer an adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform whose gene delivery efficiency is controlled by light. Upon exposure to R light, AAV engineered to display PIF6 motifs on the capsid bind to PhyB tagged with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), resulting in significantly increased translocation of viruses into the host cell nucleus and overall gene delivery efficiency. By modulating the ratio of R to FR light, the gene delivery efficiency can be tuned to as little as 35% or over 600% of the unengineered AAV. We also demonstrate spatial control of gene delivery using projected patterns of codelivered R and FR light. Overall, our successful use of light-switchable proteins in virus capsid engineering extends these important optogenetic tools into the adjacent realm of nucleic acid delivery and enables enhanced, tunable, and spatially controllable regulation of viral gene delivery. Our current light-triggered viral gene delivery prototype may be broadly useful for genetic manipulation of cells ex vivo or in vivo in transgenic model organisms, with the ultimate prospect of achieving dose- and site-specific gene expression profiles for either therapeutic (e.g., regenerative medicine) or fundamental discovery research efforts.

We therefore aimed at the precise determination of the titer of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors to improve the reliability of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown approaches. Vector titers were initially determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using four primer sets targeting different regions within the AAV vector genome (VG) and either coiled or linearized plasmid standards. Despite very low variability between replicates in each assay, these quantification experiments revealed up to 20-fold variation in vector titers. Therefore, we developed a novel approach for the reproducible determination of titers of scAAV vectors based on the use of purified genomic vector DNA as a standard (scAAVStd). Consistent results were obtained in qPCR assays using the four primer sets mentioned above. RNAi-mediated silencing of human cyclophilin B (hCycB) by short hairpin RNA-expressing scAAV vectors was investigated in HeLa cells using two independent vector preparations. We found that the required vector titers for efficient knockdown differed by a factor of 3.5 between both preparations. Hence, we also investigated the number of internalized scAAV vectors, termed transduction units (TUs). TUs were determined by qPCR applying the scAAVStd. Very similar values for 80% hCycB knockdown were obtained for the two AAV vector preparations. Thus, only the determination of TUs, rather than vector concentration, allows for reproducible results in functional analyses using AAV vectors."

Yet the basic molecular biology of this virus has not been fully addressed. One potential gene at the far 3' end of the AAV2 genome, previously referred to as X (nt 3929 to 4393), overlapping the 3' end of the cap gene, has never been characterized, although we did previously identify a promoter just up-stream (p81). Computer analysis suggested that X was involved in replication and transcription. The X protein was identified during active AAV2 replication using a polyclonal antibody against a peptide starting at amino acid 98. Reagents for the study of X included an AAV2 deletion mutant (dl78-91), a triple nucleotide substitution mutant that destroys all three 5' AUG-initiation products of X, with no effect on the cap coding sequence, and X-positive-293 cell lines. Here, we found that X up-regulated AAV2 DNA replication in differentiating keratinocytes (without helper virus, autonomous replication) and in various forms of 293 cell-based assays with help from wild type adenovirus type 5 (wt Ad5) or Ad5 helper plasmid (pHelper). The strongest contribution by X was seen in increasing wt AAV2 DNA replication in keratinocytes and dl78-91 in Ad5-infected X-positive-293 cell lines (both having multi-fold effects). Mutating the X gene in pAAV-RC (pAAV-RC-3Xneg) yielded approximately a ∼33% reduction in recombinant AAV vector DNA replication and virion production, but a larger effect was seen when using this same X-knockout AAV helper plasmid in X-positive-293 cell lines versus normal 293 cells (again, multi-fold). Taken together these data strongly suggest that AAV2 X encodes a protein involved in the AAV life cycle, particularly in increasing AAV2 DNA replication, and suggests that further studies are warranted.

As a result, we have started moving away from the opportunistic use of recombinant vectors that are derived from naturally existing viruses toward the rational engineering of tailored lentivirus (LV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for specific use in the CNS."

AAVs isolated from bats display low capsid protein sequence identities (<60%) to AAV2, AAV5, and other primate AAVs. Here we report the first capsid structure of a non-primate AAV which was isolated from bats. The capsid structure of BtAAV-10HB (10HB) was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to 3.03 Å resolution. Comparison of empty and genome-containing capsids showed that the capsid structures are almost identical except for an ordered nucleotide in a previously described nucleotide-binding pocket, the density in the 5-fold channel, and several amino acids with altered side chain conformations. Compared to other dependoparvoviruses, for example AAV2 and AAV5, 10HB displays unique structural features including insertions and deletions in capsid surface loops. Overall, the 10HB capsid structure superposes with an RMSD of 1.7 Å and 1.8 Å to AAV2 and AAV5, respectively. Currently all approved AAV human gene therapy biologics and vectors in clinical trials are based on primate isolates. However, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in the human population represents a hurdle to their use. 10HB capsids are capable of packaging AAV2 vector genomes and thus have potential as gene delivery vectors. Significantly, a screen with human sera showed lack of recognition by the 10HB capsid. Thus, the different capsid surface of 10HB vectors likely renders it ""invisible"" to potential pre-existing neutralizing human anti-AAV antibodies especially because this virus or similar variants do not exist in primate populations."

In this study, we tagged the VP2 protein of type 2 adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a 3×FLAG plasmid at the N-terminus and packaged a FLAG-tagged recombinant AAV2 chimeric mutant. The mutant AAVs were immobilized onto the tissue engineering scaffolds with crosslinked anti-FLAG antibodies by N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP). Cultured cells were seeded to scaffolds to form 3D transplants, and then tested for viral transduction both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that our FLAG-tagged AAV2 exerted similar transduction efficiency compared with the wild type AAV2 when infected cultured cells. Following immobilization onto the scaffolds of PLGA or gelatin sponge with anti-FLAG antibodies, the viral mediated transgene expression was significantly improved and more localized. Our data demonstrated that the mutation of AAV capsid targeted for antibody-based immobilization could be a practical approach for more efficient and precise transgene delivery. It was also suggested that the immobilization of AAV might have attractive potentials in applications of tissue engineering involving the targeted gene manipulation in 3D tissue cultures. "

Although these vectors are replication deficient, wild-type (wt) AAV2 prevalent in the human population could lead to replication and packaging of a type 2 TR (TR2)-flanked transgene in trans during superinfection by a helper virus, leading to ""mobilization"" of the vector genome from treated cells. More importantly, it appears likely that the majority of currently characterized AAV serotypes as well as the majority of new novel isolates are capable of rescuing and replicating AAV2 vector templates. To investigate this possibility, we flanked a green fluorescent protein transgene with type 2 and, the most divergent AAV serotype, type 5 TRs (TR2 or TR5). Consistent with AAV clades, AAV5 specifically replicated TR5 vectors, while AAV2 and AAV6 replicated TR2-flanked vectors. To exploit this specificity, we created a TR5 vector production system for Cap1 to Cap5. Next, we showed that persisting recombinant AAV genomes flanked by TR2s or TR5s were mobilized in vitro after addition of the cognate AAV Rep (as well as Rep6 for TR2) and adenoviral helper. Finally, we showed that a cell line containing a stably integrated wt AAV2 genome resulted in mobilization of a TR2-flanked vector but not a TR5-flanked vector upon adenoviral superinfection. Based on these data and the relative prevalence of wt AAV serotypes in the population, we propose that TR5 vectors have a significantly lower risk of mobilization and should be considered for clinical use."

High-producing ""masterwells"" (MWs), defined as producing >50,000 vg/cell, were identified for each oversized vector. These MWs provided stable vector production for >20 passages. The quality and potency of the AAVrh8R/FVIII-5.1 and AAVrh8R/FVIII-5.4 vectors generated by the PCL method were then compared to those prepared via transient transfection (TXN). Southern and dot blot analyses demonstrated that both production methods resulted in packaging of heterogeneously sized genomes. However, the PCL-derived rAAV vector preparations contained some genomes >4.7 kb, whereas the majority of genomes generated by the TXN method were ≤4.7 kb. The PCL process reduced packaging of non-vector DNA for both the AAVrh8R/FVIII-5.1 and the AAVrh8R/FVIII-5.4 kb vector preparations. Furthermore, more DNA-containing viral particles were obtained for the AAVrh8R/FVIII-5.1 vector. In a mouse model of hemophilia A, animals administered a PCL-derived rAAV vector exhibited twofold higher plasma FVIII activity and increased levels of vector genomes in the liver than mice treated with vector produced via TXN did.

Animals injected with AAV vectors encoding for human α-syn formed the experimental group, whereas green fluorescent protein expressing animals were used as the vector-treated control group and a third group of uninjected animals were used as naïve controls. Data were acquired at 2, 4, and 8 month time points. Nineteen metabolites were quantified in the MR spectra using LCModel software. On the basis of 92 spectra, we evaluated any potential gender effect and found that lactate (Lac) levels were lower in males compared to females, while the opposite was observed for ascorbate (Asc). Next, we assessed the effect of age and found increased levels of GABA, Tau, and GPC+PCho. Finally, we analyzed the effect of treatment and found that Lac levels (p = 0.005) were specifically lower in the α-syn group compared to the green fluorescent protein and control groups. In addition, Asc levels (p = 0.05) were increased in the vector-injected groups, whereas glucose levels remained unchanged. This study indicates that the metabolic switch between glucose-lactate could be detectable in vivo and might be modulated by Asc. No concomitant changes were found in markers of neuronal integrity (e.g., N-acetylaspartate) consistent with the fact that α-syn over-expression in cortical neurons did not result in neurodegeneration in this model.

This leads to transduction of brain regions distal to the injection site, although the extent of axonal transport and distal transduction varies widely among AAV serotypes. The mechanisms driving this variability are poorly understood. This is a critical problem for applications that require focal gene expression within a specific brain region, and also impedes the utilization of vector transport for applications requiring widespread delivery of transgene to the brain. Here, we compared AAV serotypes 1 and 9, which frequently demonstrate distal transduction, with serotype 8, which rarely spreads beyond the injection site. To examine directional AAV transport in vitro, we used a microfluidic chamber to apply dye-labeled AAV to the axon termini or to the cell bodies of primary rat embryonic cortical neurons. All three serotypes were actively transported along axons, with transport characterized by high velocities and prolonged runs in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. Coinfection with pairs of serotypes indicated that AAV1, 8, and 9 share the same intracellular compartments for axonal transport. In vivo, both AAV8 and 9 demonstrated anterograde and retrograde transport within a nonreciprocal circuit after injection into adult mouse brain, with highly similar distributions of distal transduction. However, in mass-cultured neurons, we found that AAV1 was more frequently transported than AAV8 or 9, and that the frequency of AAV9 transport could be enhanced by increasing receptor availability. Thus, while these serotypes share conserved mechanisms for axonal transport both in vitro and in vivo, the frequency of transport can vary among serotypes, and axonal transport can be markedly increased by enhancing vector uptake. This suggests that variability in distal transduction in vivo likely results from differential uptake at the plasma membrane, rather than fundamental differences in transport mechanisms among AAV serotypes."

To address these safety concerns, we have used a scalable manufacturing process to produce GMP-grade AAV8 expressing the FIXR338L gain-of-function variant with minimal (<10%) empty capsid and have performed comprehensive dose-response, biodistribution, and safety evaluations in clinically relevant hemophilia models. The scAAV8.FIXR338L vector produced greater than 6-fold increased FIX specific activity compared with wild-type FIX and demonstrated linear dose responses from doses that produced 2-500% FIX activity, associated with dose-dependent hemostasis in a tail transection bleeding challenge. More importantly, using a bleeding model that closely mimics the clinical morbidity of hemophilic arthropathy, mice that received the scAAV8.FIXR338L vector developed minimal histopathological findings of synovitis after hemarthrosis, when compared with mice that received identical doses of wild-type FIX vector.

DNA-damaging agents can improve AAV-mediated transgene expression. Hyperthermia, as one of the oldest documented tumor treatment modalities, can cause DNA damage as well. However, combined treatment consisting of hyperthermia and AAV-mediated gene therapy has not been reported yet. In this work we investigated whether therapy consisting of AAV-mediated pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) delivery combined with hyperthermia has synergistic antitumor effect on established solid tumors. We produced the recombinant AAV encoding PEDF (rAAV-PEDF). The therapeutic effect of rAAV-PEDF plus hyperthermia was evaluated in a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma mouse model, and the possible mechanism of antitumor effect was investigated. We found that rAAV-PEDF could infect a murine fibrosarcoma cell line (Meth-A) and express PEDF protein with bioactivity in vitro. In addition, in vivo experiments suggested that the combination of rAAV-PEDF with hyperthermia could significantly suppress tumor growth and prolong survival time of treated mice. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the combination therapy could inhibit angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in tumor tissues. An immunohistochemistry assay of tumor tissue showed that PEDF expression in the combined treatment group was significantly higher than in the rAAV-PEDF group, which implied that hyperthermia could improve the expression of PEDF protein in vivo. No significant differences were observed in each group by hematoxylin-eosin staining of major organs, serum chemistry test, and complete blood assay. These results indicate that the combination of rAAV-PEDF with hyperthermia has synergistic therapeutic effects on established solid tumors, with no side effects. In addition, hyperthermia could improve AAV-mediated transgene expression, which suggests that hyperthermia could serve as a promising adjunctive therapy for AAV-mediated gene therapy."

Based on our previous findings, we focused on the effects of several AAVs delivered via canalostomy injection in adult mice. Among the AAVs examined, AAV8 showed the greatest efficiency and specificity in transducing inner hair cells (IHC). The ability of Cre-expressing AAV8 to activate Cas9 in floxed-Cas9 knock-in (Cas9 KI) mice was further evaluated. We compared the effects of six different promoters (CMV, CAG, hSyn, CaMKIIa, GFAP, and ALB) of AAV8 delivered to the inner ear of adult Cas9 KI mice. Our findings showed that three AAV groups (CMV, CAG and hSyn promoters) infected the inner ear efficiently with different tropisms. Notably, AAVs with CMV, CAG, and hSyn promoters infected diverse cell types in mature murine cochleae, including IHCs. In particular, AAV8-hSyn showed high affinity to IHCs and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Neither the AAV8 virus itself (except AAV8-CAG) nor the surgical procedures used caused damage to HCs or impaired normal hearing. Our findings indicated that injection of AAV-Cre into mature inner ear efficiently induces Cas9 activation to achieve safe and efficient gene editing and different constituent promoters confer diverse infection patterns in cochlea, expanding the repertoire of gene-editing tools for regulating gene expression in target cells of the inner ear as part of the collective effort to rescue genetic hearing loss and develop effective gene therapy techniques."

A fibrin scaffold with a concentration of 50 mg/ml showed significantly elevated levels of β-galactosidase activity within explanted discs at 10 days compared to 10 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml fibrin. These findings inform efforts to optimise biodegradable scaffolds for the localised delivery of AAV in tissue engineering."

Various novel strategies for managing asthma have been explored, such as DNA vaccines, T-cell peptides, and allergen-specific immunotherapy. A principal goal of most immunotherapeutic approaches is active and long-term allergen-specific tolerance. Liver-specific gene transfer using adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been shown to favorably induce tolerogenic responses to therapeutic products in various experimental models. AAV8 has strong liver tropism and induces immune tolerance in mice. The present study aimed to determine whether hepatocyte-specific allergen expression by pseudotyped AAV2/8 alleviates asthmatic symptoms in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. Mice were intravenously injected with AAV2/8 vector carrying membrane-bound OVA transgene under transcriptional control of a hepatocyte-specific alpha 1 antitrypsin promoter (AAV2/8-OVA) and then sensitized with OVA. AAV2/8-OVA specifically transduced the OVA transgene in the liver. Airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, and Th2 cytokines were significantly suppressed in both the lungs and secondary lymphoid organs of asthmatic mice infected with AAV2/8-OVA. Significant reduction of OVA-specific antibodies was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from AAV2/8-OVA-treated mice. Moreover, AAV2/8-OVA treatment prominently promoted the expression of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-β in the liver. Enhanced Foxp3 expression was also detected in the lungs of asthmatic mice after AAV2/8-OVA treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of immune tolerance by hepatic AAV gene transfer may be beneficial for modulating allergic asthma."

Adult Dark Agouti (DA) rat hearts were intracoronarily perfused ex vivo with AAV2, AAV8, or AAV9 encoding firefly luciferase and transplanted heterotopically into the abdomen of syngenic DA or allogenic Wistar-Furth (WF) recipients. Serial in vivo bioluminescent imaging of syngraft and allograft recipients was performed for 6 months and 4 weeks, respectively. Grafts were removed for PCR-, RT-PCR, and luminometer analysis. In vivo bioluminescent imaging of recipients showed that AAV9 induced a prominent and stable luciferase activity in the abdomen, when compared with AAV2 and AAV8. However, ex vivo analyses revealed that intracoronary perfusion with AAV2 resulted in the highest heart transplant transduction levels in syngrafts and allografts. Ex vivo intracoronary delivery of AAV2 resulted in efficient transgene expression in heart transplants, whereas intracoronary AAV9 escapes into adjacent tissues. In terms of cardiac transduction, these results suggest AAV2 as a potential vector for gene therapy in preclinical heart transplants studies, and highlight the importance of delivery route in gene transfer studies."

Toward identification of the capsid determinants for these properties, the structure of AAVrh.8 was determined by X-ray crystallography to 3.5 Å resolution and compared to those of other AAV isolates. The capsid viral protein (VP) structure consists of an αA helix and an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel core conserved in parvoviruses, and large insertion loop regions between the β-strands form the capsid surface topology. The AAVrh.8 capsid exhibits the surface topology conserved in all AAVs: depressions at the icosahedral twofold axis and surrounding the cylindrical channel at the fivefold axis, and three protrusions around the threefold axis. A structural comparison to serotypes AAV2, AAV8, and AAV9, to which AAVrh.8 shares ∼ 84%, ∼ 91%, and ∼ 87% VP sequence identity, respectively, revealed differences in the surface loops known to affect receptor binding, transduction efficiency, and antigenicity. Consistent with this observation, biochemical assays showed that AAVrh.8 is unable to bind heparin and does not cross-react with conformational monoclonal antibodies and human donor serum directed against the other AAVs compared. This structure of AAVrh.8 thus identified capsid surface differences which can serve as template regions for rational design of vectors with enhanced transduction for specific tissues and escape pre-existing antibody recognition. These features are essential for the creation of an AAV vector toolkit that is amenable to personalized disease treatment."

Because undamaged joints are unlikely to require treatment, the study of AAV delivery in joint injury models is crucial to potential therapeutic applications. This study tests the hypotheses that persistent and controllable AAV-transgene expression are (1) highly localized to the cartilage when AAV is injected postinjury and (2) localized to the intra-articular soft tissues when AAV is injected preinjury. Two AAV injection time points, postinjury and preinjury, were investigated in osteochondral defect and anterior cruciate ligament transection models of joint injury. Rats injected with AAV tetracycline response element (TRE)-luciferase received oral doxycycline for 7 days. Luciferase expression was evaluated longitudinally for 6 months. Transgene expression was persistent and controllable with oral doxycycline for 6 months in all groups. However, the location of transgene expression was different: postinjury AAV-injected knees had luciferase expression highly localized to the cartilage, while preinjury AAV-injected knees had more widespread signal from intra-articular soft tissues. The differential transgene localization between preinjury and postinjury injection can be used to optimize treatment strategies. Highly localized postinjury injection appears advantageous for treatments targeting repair cells. The more generalized and controllable reservoir of transgene expression following AAV injection before anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) suggests an intriguing concept for prophylactic delivery of joint protective factors to individuals at high risk for early osteoarthritis (OA). Successful external control of intra-articular transgene expression provides an added margin of safety for these potential clinical applications."

To validate this tracing method further, AAV (serotype 1) was systematically compared with BDA as an anterograde tracer by injecting both tracers into three cortical and 15 subcortical regions in C57BL/6J mice. Identical parameters were used for our sequential iontophoretic injections, producing injections of AAV that were more robust in size and in density of neurons infected compared with those of BDA. However, these differences did not preclude further comparison between the tracers, because the pairs of injections were suitably colocalized and contained some percentage of double-labeled neurons. A qualitative analysis of projection patterns showed that the two tracers behave very similarly when injection sites are well matched. Additionally, a quantitative analysis of relative projection intensity for cases targeting primary motor cortex (MOp), primary somatosensory cortex (SSp), and caudoputamen (CP) showed strong agreement in the ranked order of projection intensities between the two tracers. A detailed analysis of the projections of two brain regions (SSp and MOp) revealed many targets that have not previously been described in the mouse or rat. Minor retrograde labeling of neurons was observed in all cases examined, for both AAV and BDA.

The tropism of each AAV serotype has been extensively studied using systemic delivery routes, but very few studies have compared their transduction efficiency through direct intramuscular injection. Yet, in some muscular dystrophies, where only a few muscles are primarily affected, a local intramuscular injection to target these muscles would be the most appropriate route. A comprehensive comparison between different recombinant AAV (rAAV) serotypes is therefore needed. In this study, we investigated the transduction efficiency of rAAV serotypes 1-10 by local injection in skeletal muscle of control C57BL/6 mice. We used a CMV-nls-LacZ reporter cassette allowing nuclear expression of LacZ to easily localize targeted cells. Detection of β-galactosidase activity on muscle cryosections demonstrated that rAAV serotypes 1, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were more efficient than the others, with rAAV9 being the most efficient in mice. Furthermore, using a model of human muscle xenograft in immunodeficient mice, we observed that in human muscle, rAAV8 and rAAV9 had similar transduction efficiency.

An inoculum of ∼10(5) CFU allowed B. bronchiseptica RB50 to persist in the upper and lower respiratory tracts for at least 21 days.

In the SP-D KO model, postponement of AAV administration to day 9 postinfection resulted in only a two fold reduction in reporter gene expression, when compared with expression seen in uninfected controls.

In the retina, AAV has been used to introduce exogenous genes into photoreceptors, and photoreceptor-specific enhancers/promoters are used in most cases. Therefore, serotype specificity of AAV in retinal subtypes is unclear, particularly in vitro. We compared its infection profile in mouse and monkey retinas using EGFP under the control of the CAG promoter, which expressed the gene ubiquitously and strongly regardless of cell type. AAV1, 8, and 9 infected the horizontal cells when an embryonic day-17 retina was used as a host. Amacrine cell was also a major target of AAVs, and a small number of rod photoreceptors were infected. When adult retinas were used as a host, the main target of AAV was Müller glia. A small number of rod photoreceptors were also infected. In the adult common marmoset retina, rod and cone photoreceptors were efficiently infected by AAV1, 8, and 9. A portion of the Müller glia and amacrine cells were also infected. In summary, the infection specificity of different AAV serotypes did not differ, but was dependent on the stage of the host retina. In addition, infection specificities differed between mature marmoset retinas and mature mouse retinas."

HBV transgenic mice injected with high doses of AAV vectors containing the U6 promoter produced abundant shRNAs, transiently inhibited HBV, but induced severe hepatotoxicity. Sustained HBV suppression without liver toxicity can be achieved by lowering the dose of AAV-U6 vectors. AAVs containing the weaker H1 promoter did not cause liver injury, but their therapeutic efficacy was highly dependent on the sequence of the shRNA. Mice treated with the toxic U6-promoter-driven shRNA showed little change in hepatic microRNA levels, but a dramatic increase in hepatic leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Hepatotoxicity was completely absent in immunodeficient mice and significantly alleviated in wild-type mice depleted of macrophages and granulocytes, suggesting that host inflammatory responses are the major cause of liver injury induced by the overexpressed shRNAs from AAV-U6 vectors.

Miniaturized forms of agrin (mAgrin) have been shown to ameliorate disease pathology in a laminin-α2 knockout mouse model of muscular dystrophy, acting as a link between α-DG and laminin(s).

However, in vivo delivery of mAgrin via adeno-associated virus (AAV) into FKRP mutant mice was unable to improve dystrophic phenotypes, both histologically and functionally. These results likely reflect insufficient binding of mAgrin to hypoglycosylated α-DG on muscle fibers and possibly abrogation of binding from molar excess of overexpressed AAV-delivered mAgrin. Further exploration of mAgrin modification is necessary to strengthen its binding to other membrane components, including hypoglycosylated α-DG, for potential therapeutic applications."

Endosomal acidification inhibitors blocked AAV2 antigen presentation by over 90%, while proteasome inhibitors completely abrogated antigen presentation. Using mutant viruses that are defective for nuclear entry, we observed a 90% decrease in capsid antigen presentation. Different antigen presentation efficiencies were achieved by selectively mutating virion nuclear localization signals. Low antigen presentation was demonstrated with basic region 1 (BR1) mutants, despite relatively high transduction efficiency, whereas there was no difference in antigen presentation between BR2 and BR3 mutants defective for transduction, as compared with wild-type AAV2. These results suggest that effective AAV2 capsid antigen presentation is dependent on AAV virion escape from the endosome/lysosome for antigen degradation by proteasomes, but is independent of nuclear uncoating. These results should facilitate the design of effective strategies to evade capsid-specific CTL-mediated elimination of AAV-transduced target cells in future clinical trials."

The goal of this study was to determine the impact of HS binding on retinal transduction by Ivt-delivered AAVs. The heparin affinities of AAV2-based tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Y-F) and threonine-to-valine (T-V) capsid mutants, designed to avoid proteasomal degradation during cellular trafficking, were established. In addition, the impact of grafting HS binding residues onto AAV1, AAV5, and AAV8(Y733F) as well as ablation of HS binding by AAV2-based vectors on retinal transduction was investigated. Finally, the potential relationship between thermal stability of AAV2-based capsids and Ivt-mediated transduction was explored. The results show that the Y-F and T-V AAV2 capsid mutants bind heparin but with slightly reduced affinity relative to that of AAV2. The grafting of HS binding increased Ivt transduction by AAV1 but not by AAV5 or AAV8(Y733F). The substitution of any canonical HS binding residues ablated Ivt-mediated transduction by AAV2-based vectors. However, these same HS variant vectors displayed efficient retinal transduction when delivered subretinally. Notably, a variant devoid of canonical HS binding residues, AAV2(4pMut)ΔHS, was remarkably efficient at transducing photoreceptors. The disparate AAV phenotypes indicate that HS binding, while critical for AAV2-based vectors, is not the sole determinant for transduction via the Ivt route. Finally, Y-F and T-V mutations alter capsid stability, with a potential relationship existing between stability and improvements in retinal transduction by Ivt injection."

The gene therapy vector, AAV-DJ, is a hybrid of natural serotypes that was previously derived by directed evolution, selecting for hepatocyte entry and resistance to neutralization by human serum. The structure of AAV-DJ differs from that of parental serotypes in two regions where neutralizing antibodies bind, so immune escape appears to have been the primary driver of AAV-DJ's directed evolution. Fondaparinux is an analog of cell surface heparan sulfate to which several AAVs bind during entry. Fondaparinux interacts with viral arginines at a known heparin binding site, without the large conformational changes whose presence was controversial in low-resolution imaging of AAV2-heparin complexes. The glycan density suggests multi-modal binding that could accommodate sequence variation and multivalent binding along a glycan polymer, consistent with a role in attachment, prior to more specific interactions with a receptor protein mediating entry."

The replicative state of target cells is known to influence the efficiency of these processes and knowledge of the host-vector interactions involved is required for optimally effective vector deployment. Here we show, for the first time in vivo, that in addition to the known effects of hepatocellular replication on AAV-mediated gene transfer, the vector itself exerts a potent, albeit transient suppressive effect on cell cycle progression that is relieved on a time course that correlates with the known rate of clearance of input single-stranded vector DNA. This finding requires further mechanistic investigation, delineates an excellent model system for such studies and further deepens our insight into the complexity of interactions between AAV vectors and the cell cycle in a clinically promising target tissue.

The rAAV9-DES-hGAA vector is being developed as a treatment for both early- and late-onset Pompe disease, in which patients lack sufficient lysosomal alpha-glucosidase leading to glycogen accumulation. In young patients, the therapy may need to be readministered after a period of time to maintain therapeutic levels of GAA. Administration of AAV-based gene therapies is commonly associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies that may reduce the effectiveness of the vector, especially if readministration is required. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of rAAV9-DES-hGAA to correct cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology in Gaa(-/-) mice, an animal model of Pompe disease. This article describes the IND-enabling preclinical studies supporting the program for a phase I/II clinical trial in adult patients with Pompe. These studies were designed to evaluate the toxicology, biodistribution, and potential for readministration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior muscle using an immune modulation strategy developed for this study. In the proposed clinical study, six adult participants with late-onset Pompe disease will be enrolled. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells before the initial exposure of the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg four months after initial dosing. The dosing of the active agent is accompanied by a control injection of excipient dosing in the contralateral leg to allow for blinding and randomization of dosing, which may also strengthen the evidence generated from gene therapy studies in the future. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the three months following each dosing will assess the safety, biochemical, and functional impact of the vector. "

Recipients of liver or kidney transplants were tested before and 4 weeks after induction of IS in comparison with matched samples from healthy human adults and an additional cohort with comorbid conditions similar to those of the transplant patients. Our data show that transplant patients and comorbid control subjects have markedly higher frequencies of circulating AAV capsid-specific T cells compared with healthy adults. On average, IS resulted in a reduction of AAV-specific CD4⁺ T cells, whereas numbers of circulating CD8⁺ effector and central memory T cells tended to increase. Independent of the type of transplant or the IS regimens, the trend of AAV capsid-specific T cell responses after drug treatment varied; in some patients responses were unaffected whereas others showed decreases or even pronounced increases, casting doubt on the usefulness of prophylactic IS for AAV vector recipients."

Understanding the pathophysiology and cellular and molecular events of degenerative disc disease has resulted in the proposal of a gene therapy approach to halt and reverse disc degeneration. We explored the feasibility of reversing intervertebral disc degeneration using human vascular endothelial growth factor165 (hVEGF165) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) gene therapy. hVEGF165 complementary DNA was obtained from pcDNA3(+)-hVEGF165 and cloned into adeno-associated virus (AAV)-pSNAV plasmids to construct the recombinant plasmid, AAV-pSNAV-hVEGF165. After identification through restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing, the AAV-pSNAV-hVEGF165 was transfected into HEK293 cells and vascular endothelial cells. Protein expression of hVEGF165 was detected using a fluorescent immunohistochemical assay, and the effect of hVEGF165 on vascular endothelial cell proliferation was determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Packaged AAV-hVEGF165 and AAV-TGF-β1 were co-transfected into the annulus fibrosus cells of degenerative intervertebral discs. hVEGF165 and TGF-β1 expression by annulus fibrosus cells and the effect of the co-transfection on the level of collagen type I protein expression by annulus fibrosus cells were detected with Western blot. The results of restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing confirmed that AAV-pSNAV-hVEGF165 plasmids were constructed. The fluorescent immunohistochemical results confirmed hVEGF165 protein expression. The MTT results showed that the hVEGF165 protein promoted vascular endothelial cell proliferation. Biologically active AAV-hVEGF165 and AAV-TGF-β1 were successfully constructed.

Here, we report that a single intrathecal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus rhesus-10 (rAAVrh10) into the lumbar cistern led to transgene expression in 60 to 90 % of the cells in the spinal cord. The transgene was expressed in all cell types, including neurons, glia, ependymal cells, and endothelial cells. Additionally, the transgene was expressed in some brain areas up to the frontal cortex and the olfactory bulb. The rAAV was distributed predominantly in the spinal cord, where its genome copy was over ten times that of the peripheral organs. Compared with intravenous injection, another method for rAAV delivery to the broad central nervous system (CNS), the intrathecal injection reduced the dosage of rAAV required to achieve similar or higher levels of transgene expression in the CNS by ~100-fold. Finally, the transduced areas were co-localized with the perivascular spaces of Virchow-Robin, from which the rAAV spreads further into the CNS parenchyma, thus suggesting that rAAV penetrated the CNS parenchyma through this pathway. Taken together, we have defined a fast and efficient method to deliver widespread transgene expression in mature spinal cord in mice. This method can be applied to stably overexpress or silence gene expression in the spinal cord to investigate gene functions in mammalian CNS. Additionally, this method can be applied to validate therapeutic targets for spinal cord diseases."

Robust cardiac transduction from peripheral vein injection has been achieved in rodents using adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype-9 (AAV-9). However, a similar approach has failed to transduce the heart in dogs, a commonly used large animal model for heart diseases. To develop an effective noninvasive method to deliver exogenous genes to the dog heart, we employed an AAV-8 vector that expresses human placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Vectors were delivered to three neonatal dogs at the doses of 1.35×10(14), 7.14×10(14), and 9.06×10(14) viral genome particles/kg body weight via the jugular vein. Transduction efficiency and overall safety were evaluated at 1.5, 2.5, and 12 months postinjection. AAV delivery was well tolerated and dog growth was normal. Blood chemistry and internal organ histology were unremarkable. Widespread skeletal muscle transduction was observed in all dogs without T-cell infiltration. Encouragingly, whole heart myocardial transduction was achieved in two dogs that received higher doses and cardiac expression lasted for at least 1 year. In summary, peripheral vein AAV-8 injection may represent a simple heart gene transfer method in large mammals. Further optimization of this gene delivery strategy may open the door for a readily applicable gene therapy method to treat many heart diseases."

However, immune responses toward the vector or transgene product have been observed in preclinical and clinical studies. TLR9 has been implicated in promoting AAV-directed immune responses, but vectors have not been developed to circumvent this barrier. To assess the requirement of TLR9 in promoting immunity toward AAV-associated antigens following skeletal muscle gene transfer in mice, we compared immunological responses in WT and Tlr9-deficient mice that received an AAV vector with an immunogenic capsid, AAVrh32.33. In Tlr9-deficient mice, IFN-γ T cell responses toward capsid and transgene antigen were suppressed, resulting in minimal cellular infiltrate and stable transgene expression in target muscles. These findings suggest that AAV-directed immune responses may be circumvented by depleting the ligand for TLR9 (CpG sequences) from the vector genome. Indeed, we found that CpG-depleted AAVrh32.33 vectors could establish persistent transgene expression, evade immunity, and minimize infiltration of effector cells. Thus, CpG-depleted AAV vectors could improve outcome of clinical trials of gene therapy for skeletal muscle disease. "

Loss of expression was linked to an expansion of AAV capsid-specific T-cell responses, leading to the hypothesis that rAAV vectors recall pre-existing memory T cells that had been induced by natural infections with AAV together with a helper virus. Although this was hotly debated at first, AAV capsid-specific T-cell responses were observed in several gene transfer trials that used high doses of rAAV vectors.

No autocleavage was seen at pH 7.5. Examination of other AAV serotypes showed at least two different pH-induced cleavage patterns, suggesting that different serotypes have evolved alternative protease cleavage sites. In contrast, incubation of AAV serotypes with an external protease substrate showed that purified AAV capsid preparations have robust protease activity at neutral pH but not at pH 5.5, opposite to what is seen with capsid protein autocleavage. Several lines of evidence suggested that protease activity is inherent in AAV capsids and is not due to contaminating proteins. Control virus preparations showed no protease activity on external substrates, and filtrates of AAV virus preparations also showed no protease activity contaminating the capsids. Further, N-terminal Edman sequencing identified unique autocleavage sites in AAV1 and AAV9, and mutagenesis of amino acids adjacent to these sites eliminated cleavage. Finally, mutation of an amino acid in AAV2 (E563A) that is in a conserved pH-sensitive structural region eliminated protease activity on an external substrate but did not seem to affect autocleavage. Taken together, our data suggested that AAV capsids have one or more protease active sites that are sensitive to pH induction. Further, it appears that acidic pHs comparable to those seen in late endosomes induce a structural change in the capsid that induces autolytic protease activity. The pH-dependent protease activity may have a role in viral infection."

These included the use of scAAV helper viruses containing (1) hepatocyte-specific promoters, (2) tyrosine-mutant AAV2 capsids, and (3) additional AAV serotype vectors known to efficiently transduce hepatocytes.

AdV had the highest transduction efficiency in cardiomyocytes followed by AAV2 and AAV9, and the lowest efficiency was seen with LeV. The local myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle (LV) was proportional to transduction efficiency. AdV caused LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Neither of the locally injected AAV serotypes impaired the LV systolic function, but AAV9 caused diastolic dysfunction to some extent. LeV did not affect the cardiac function. We also studied systemic delivery of AAV9, which led to transduction of cardiomyocytes throughout the myocardium. However, also diffuse fibrosis was present leading to significantly impaired LV systolic and diastolic function and pathological ECG changes. Compared with widely used AdV vector, AAV2, AAV9 and LeV were less effective in transducing cardiomyocytes but also less harmful.

To comprehensively explore this phenomenon, we examined AAV genome replication in several human cell lines exposed to different genotoxic conditions. We found that all treatments induced only negligible levels of AAV replication never exceeding ten fold above background. Further investigation indicated that induction of helper-independent AAV replication relied on the synergistic contribution of several extrinsic factors linked to the origin of the cell line and the quality of the AAV preparation. These results further support the notion that helper independent AAV replication cannot occur at significant levels in vivo."

AAV5 is the most divergent (55% similarity vs. other serotypes) and like AAV1 vector is known to transduce liver efficiently. AAV1 and AAV5 vectors are also immunologically distinct by virtue of their low seroprevalence and minimal cross reactivity against pre-existing AAV2 neutralizing antibodies.

However, broader application is still limited by complex vector production, biosafety requirements, and vector-mediated immunogenic responses, possibly interfering with disease-relevant pathways. Here, we describe adeno-associated virus (AAV) variant 6.2 as an ideal vector for lung delivery in mice, overcoming most of the aforementioned limitations. In a proof-of-concept study using AAV6.2 vectors expressing IL-13 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), we were able to induce hallmarks of severe asthma and pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. Phenotypic characterization and deep sequencing analysis of the AAV-IL-13 asthma model revealed a characteristic disease signature. Furthermore, suitability of the model for compound testing was also demonstrated by pharmacological intervention studies using an anti-IL-13 antibody and dexamethasone. Similarly, the AAV-TGF-β1 fibrosis model showed several disease-like pathophenotypes monitored by micro-computed tomography imaging and lung function measurement. Most importantly, analyses using stuffer control vectors demonstrated that in contrast to a common adenovirus-5 vector, AAV6.2 vectors did not induce any measurable inflammation and therefore carry a lower risk of altering relevant readouts. In conclusion, we propose AAV6.2 as an ideal vector system for the functional characterization of target genes in the context of pulmonary diseases in mice. "

Current AAV vector manufacturing methods employ helper viruses to deliver functions needed to produce replication-defective recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors, and clearance of infectious helper virus from the drug substance is essential for ensuring the safety of rAAV-based therapies. We have developed a manufacturing method for the production of rAAV vectors using a recombinant herpes simplex virus type 1 (rHSV) complementation system in suspension baby hamster kidney cells. The manufacturing process includes three primary unit operations, detergent lysis of the cell harvest and two downstream column chromatography steps, which achieve viral clearance. These unit operations inactivate and remove HSV, including replication-competent HSV present at low levels in rHSV helper stocks. Here we report results quantifying the reduction in HSV achieved during rAAV vector purification. Clearance of HSV was at least 6.84 log10 with 1% Triton X-100, 4.34 log10 with CIM Q column chromatography, and 2.86 log10 with AVB affinity chromatography. Combined, these three orthogonal methods achieved clearance of at least 14.04 log10 of HSV. The total input quantity of rHSV in a 100-liter production batch is approximately 1.2×10(12) plaque-forming units (pfu), and after purification, the concentration of residual rHSV in the resulting drug substance of approximately 450 ml would be less than 2.42×10(-5) pfu/ml. A rAAV vector produced using this method was used in a clinical trial in which subjects receive up to 100 intramuscular injections of 1.35 ml each, which would contain a maximum of 3.27×10(-3) pfu of HSV. These results support the safety of rAAV vectors produced using our rHSV complementation method."

We found that AAV8 was the most effective AAV vector in utricular gene transfer. Swim tests and measurements of auditory brainstem response revealed minimal loss of vestibular function and hearing after canalostomy. In the normal utricle after AAV8 infusion, transduction efficiency peaked at 7 days, and was maintained thereafter, in vestibular HCs, and at 3 days in supporting cells (SCs). In the streptomycin-lesioned utricle, the SC transduction efficiency peaked at 7 days and decreased at 30 days. In conclusion, AAV8-mediated gene transfer via canalostomy facilitates efficient and safe transduction in mouse vestibular sensory epithelium, and may in the future become clinically relevant for human vestibular gene therapy.

However, passive uptake of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into cells following sonoporation does not adequately explain observations of enhanced transduction by UTMD. This study investigated alternative mechanisms of UTMD enhancement in AAV delivery. UTMD significantly enhanced transduction efficiency of AAV in a dose-dependent manner. UTMD stimulated a persistent uptake of AAV into the cytoplasm and nucleus. This phenomenon occurred over several hours, suggesting that some viral particles are endocytosed by cells rather than exclusively passing through pores created by sonoporation. Additionally, UTMD enhanced clathrin expression and accumulation at the plasma membrane suggesting greater clathrin-mediated endocytosis following UTMD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that UTMD stimulated formation of clathrin-coated pits (CPs) and uncoated pits (nCPs). Furthermore, inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis partially blocked the enhancement of AAV uptake following UTMD. The results of this study implicate endocytosis as a mechanism that contributes to UTMD-enhanced AAV delivery."

Similar to the case for most DNA viruses, after receptor binding and entry, AAV traverses the cytoplasm and deposits the viral genome in the cell nucleus. In this study, we examined the role of the microtubule (MT) network in productive AAV infection. Using pharmacological reagents (e.g., nocodazole), live-cell imaging, and flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that AAV type 2 (AAV2) transduction was reduced by at least 2-fold in the absence of the MT network. Cell surface attachment and viral internalization were not dependent on an intact MT network. In treated cells at 2 h postinfection, quantitative three-dimensional (3D) microscopy determined a reproducible difference in number of intracellular particles associated with the nuclear membrane or the nucleus compared to that for controls (6 to 7% versus 26 to 30%, respectively). Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated a direct association of virions with MTs, further supporting a critical role in AAV infection. To investigate the underling mechanisms, we employed single-particle tracking (SPT) to monitor the viral movement in real time. Surprisingly, unlike other DNA viruses (e.g., adenovirus [Ad] and herpes simplex virus [HSV]) that display bidirectional motion on MTs, AAV2 displays only unidirectional movement on MTs toward the nuclei, with peak instantaneous velocities at 1.5 to 3.5 μm/s. This rapid and unidirectional motion on MTs lasts for about 5 to 10 s and results in AAV particles migrating more than 10 μm in the cytoplasm reaching the nucleus very efficiently. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis determined that, unlike Ad and HSV, AAV2 particles were transported on MTs within membranous compartments, and surprisingly, the acidification of AAV2-containing endosomes was delayed by the disruption of MTs. These findings together suggest an as-yet-undescribed model in which after internalization, AAV2 exploits MTs for rapid cytoplasmic trafficking in endosomal compartments unidirectionally toward the perinuclear region, where most acidification events for viral escape take place."

However, the genome-wide integration of AAV has not been defined, and the principles underlying this recombination remain unclear. Using a novel high-throughput approach, integrant capture sequencing, nearly 12 million AAV junctions were recovered from a human cell line, providing five orders of magnitude more data than were previously available. Forty-five percent of integrations occurred near AAVS1, and several thousand novel integration hotspots were identified computationally. Most of these occurred in genes, with dozens of hotspots targeting known oncogenes. Viral replication protein binding sites (RBS) and transcriptional activity were major factors favoring integration. In a first for eukaryotic viruses, the data reveal a unique asymmetric integration profile with distinctive directional orientation of viral genomes. These studies provide a new understanding of AAV integration biology through the use of unbiased high-throughput data acquisition and bioinformatics. "

The larger Rep proteins, Rep78 and Rep68, are required for viral replication, whereas Rep40 and Rep52 are needed to package AAV genomes into preformed capsids; these smaller proteins are missing the site-specific DNA-binding and endonuclease domain found in Rep68/78. Other viral SF3 helicases, such as the simian virus 40 large T antigen and the papillomavirus E1 protein, are active as hexameric assemblies. However, Rep40 and Rep52 have not been observed to form stable oligomers on their own or with DNA, suggesting that important determinants of helicase multimerization lie outside the helicase domain. Here, we report that when the 23-residue linker that connects the endonuclease and helicase domains is appended to the adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV5) helicase domain, the resulting protein forms discrete complexes on DNA consistent with single or double hexamers. The formation of these complexes does not require the Rep binding site sequence, nor is it nucleotide dependent. These complexes have stimulated ATPase and helicase activities relative to the helicase domain alone, indicating that they are catalytically relevant, a result supported by negative-stain electron microscopy images of hexameric rings. Similarly, the addition of the linker region to the AAV5 Rep endonuclease domain also confers on it the ability to bind and multimerize on nonspecific double-stranded DNA. We conclude that the linker is likely a key contributor to Rep68/78 DNA-dependent oligomerization and may play an important role in mediating Rep68/78's conversion from site-specific DNA binding to nonspecific DNA unwinding."

The large AAV Rep proteins Rep68 and Rep78 are essential factors required in almost every step of the viral life cycle. Structurally, they share two domains: a modified version of the AAA(+) domain that characterizes the SF3 family of helicases and an N-terminal domain that binds DNA specifically. The combination of these two domains imparts extraordinary multifunctionality to work as initiators of DNA replication and regulators of transcription, in addition to their essential role during site-specific integration. Although most members of the SF3 family form hexameric rings in vitro, the oligomeric nature of Rep68 is unclear due to its propensity to aggregate in solution. We report here a comprehensive study to determine the oligomeric character of Rep68 using a combination of methods that includes sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, and hydrodynamic modeling. We have determined that residue Cys151 induces Rep68 to aggregate in vitro. We show that Rep68 displays a concentration-dependent dynamic oligomeric behavior characterized by the presence of two populations: one with monomers and dimers in slow equilibrium and a second one consisting of a mixture of multiple-ring structures of seven and eight members. The presence of either ATP or ADP induces formation of larger complexes formed by the stacking of multiple rings. Taken together, our results support the idea of a Rep68 molecule that exhibits the flexible oligomeric behavior needed to perform the wide range of functions occurring during the AAV life cycle."

Patients are born profoundly deaf and exhibit progressive loss of vision starting in their first decade. MYO7A is expressed in human photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, but disease pathology begins in photoreceptors, highlighting the need to develop a gene replacement strategy that effectively targets this cell type. For its safety and efficacy in clinical trials and ability to transduce postmitotic photoreceptors, we have focused on developing a clinically applicable adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform for delivering full-length MYO7A cDNA (∼6.7 kb). Packaging of full-length MYO7A cDNA in AAV produces vectors with heterogeneous, fragmented genomes (""fAAV"") capable of reconstituting full-length cDNA postinfection. We previously showed that fAAV vectors effectively delivered full-length MYO7A in vitro and in vivo. However, fAAV vectors are relatively inefficient and their heterogeneous genomes preclude definitive characterization, a drawback for clinical translatability. The aim of this study was to overcome these limitations by creating dual-AAV-vector platforms for USH1B with defined genomes. Human MYO7A was cloned in AAV vector pairs, each containing genomes <5 kb and intact inverted terminal repeats. One vector contained a promoter and 5' portion of the cDNA and the partner vector contained a 3' portion and polyadenylation signal. ""Simple overlap"" vectors share a central part of the MYO7A cDNA sequence. ""Trans-splicing"" and ""hybrid"" vectors utilize splice donor and acceptor sites with and without an additional central recombinogenic sequence, respectively. Vector pairs expressed full-length MYO7A in vitro and in vivo with equal or higher efficiency than fAAV, with a hybrid platform being most efficient.

The role of host receptors that mediate these processes is not well understood. In the current study, we utilized AAV serotype 4 (AAV4) as a model to evaluate whether ubiquitously expressed 2,3-linked sialic acid and the developmentally regulated marker 2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA) regulate viral transport and tropism in the neonatal brain. Modulation of the levels of SA and PSA in cell culture studies using specific neuraminidases revealed possibly opposing roles of the two glycans in AAV4 transduction. Interestingly, upon intracranial injection into lateral ventricles of the neonatal mouse brain, a low-affinity AAV4 mutant (AAV4.18) displayed a striking shift in cellular tropism from 2,3-linked SA(+) ependymal lining to 2,8-linked PSA(+) migrating progenitors in the rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb. In addition, this gain-of-function phenotype correlated with robust CNS spread of AAV4.18 through paravascular transport pathways. Consistent with these observations, altering glycan dynamics within the brain by coadministering SA- and PSA-specific neuraminidases resulted in striking changes to the cellular tropisms and transduction efficiencies of both parental and mutant vectors. We postulate that glycan signatures associated with host development can be exploited to redirect novel AAV vectors to specific cell types in the brain."

On the one hand, its simple structure not only facilitates investigations into virus biology but, combined with the availability of numerous natural AAV variants with distinct infection efficiency and specificity, also makes AAV a preferred substrate for engineering of gene delivery vectors. On the other hand, it is striking to witness a recent flurry of reports that highlight and partially close persistent gaps in our understanding of AAV virus and vector biology. This is all the more perplexing considering that recombinant AAVs have already been used in >160 clinical trials and recently been commercialized as gene therapeutics. Here, we discuss a reason for these advances in AAV research, namely, the advent and application of powerful high-throughput technology for dissection of AAV-host interactions and optimization of AAV gene therapy vectors. As relevant examples, we focus on the discovery of (i) a ""new"" cellular AAV receptor, AAVR, (ii) host restriction factors for AAV entry, and (iii) AAV capsid determinants that mediate trafficking through the blood-brain barrier. While items i/ii are prototypes of extra- or intracellular AAV host factors that were identified via high-throughput screenings, item iii exemplifies the power of molecular evolution to investigate the virus itself. In the future, we anticipate that these and other key technologies will continue to accelerate the dissection of AAV biology and will yield a wealth of new designer viruses for clinical use."

We have constructed a series of AAV vectors expressing GFP under the control of different promoters including NF-κB -responsive elements. As an initial screen, the vectors were tested in vitro in HEK-293T cells treated with TNF-α. The best profile of GFP induction was obtained with a promoter containing two blocks of four NF-κB -responsive sequences from the human JCV neurotropic polyoma virus promoter, fused to a new tight minimal CMV promoter, optimally distant from each other. A therapeutical gene, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) cDNA under the control of serotype 1-encapsidated NF-κB -responsive AAV vector (AAV-NF) was protective in senescent cultures of mouse cortical neurons. AAV-NF was then evaluated in vivo in the kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy, a major neurological disorder with a central pathophysiological role for NF-κB activation. We demonstrate that AAV-NF, injected in the hippocampus, responded to disease induction by mediating GFP expression, preferentially in CA1 and CA3 neurons and astrocytes, specifically in regions where inflammatory markers were also induced. Altogether, these data demonstrate the feasibility to use disease-activated transcription factor-responsive elements in order to drive transgene expression specifically in affected cells in inflammatory CNS disorders using AAV-mediated gene transfer."

After three cycles of selection, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-packaged clones were administered directly into brain or i.v. 1 day after kainic acid-induced seizures. Several clones that were effective after intracranial administration did not transduce brain cells after the i.v. administration. However, two clones (32 and 83) transduced the cells after direct brain infusion and after i.v. administration transduced the cells that were localized to the piriform cortex and ventral hippocampus, areas exhibiting a seizure-compromised BBB. No transduction occurred in areas devoid of BBB compromise. Only one parental serotype (AAV8) exhibited a similar expression profile, but the biodistribution of 32 and 83 diverged dramatically from this parental serotype. Thus, novel AAV vectors have been created that can selectively cross the seizure-compromised BBB and transduce cells."

In spinal cord glycinergic inhibition predominates, whereas GABAergic inhibition predominates in the brain. The retina uses GABA and glycine in approximately equal proportions. Glycinergic crossover inhibition, initiated in the On retinal pathway, controls glutamate release from presynaptic OFF cone bipolar cells (CBCs) and directly shapes temporal response properties of OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the retina, four glycine receptor (GlyR) α-subunit isoforms are expressed in different sublaminae and their synaptic currents differ in decay kinetics. GlyRα1, expressed in both On and Off sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer, could be the glycinergic isoform that mediates On-to-Off crossover inhibition. However, subunit-selective glycine contributions remain unknown because we lack selective antagonists or cell class-specific subunit knockouts. To examine the role of GlyRα1 in direct inhibition in mature RGCs, we used retrogradely transported adeno-associated virus (AAV) that performed RNAi and eliminated almost all glycinergic spontaneous and visually evoked responses in PV5 (OFFα(Transient)) RGCs. Comparisons of responses in PV5 RGCs infected with AAV-scrambled-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or AAV-Glra1-shRNA confirm a role for GlyRα1 in crossover inhibition in cone-driven circuits. Our results also define a role for direct GlyRα1 inhibition in setting the resting membrane potential of PV5 RGCs. The absence of GlyRα1 input unmasked a serial and a direct feedforward GABA(A)ergic modulation in PV5 RGCs, reflecting a complex interaction between glycinergic and GABA(A)ergic inhibition."

However, high cross-reactivity between AAV serotypes remains a barrier for re-injection. Shifts in Nab seroprevalence during the first decade need to be confirmed by longitudinal studies. This possibility suggests that pediatric patients could respond differently to AAV therapy according to age. If late childhood is an ideal age window, intervention at an early age when maternal Nab levels are high may be challenging. Nab-positive children excluded from trials could be rescreened for eligibility at regular intervals because this status may change."

For studying valve diseases and developing valve therapies, effective methods to manipulate gene expression in primary valvular interstitial cells (VICs), which promote calcification in disease, would be valuable. Unfortunately, there is little information reported about effective gene delivery methods for VICs. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a clinically proven gene delivery vector capable of transducing many cell types and tissues, but has not yet been reported to infect valvular cells. In this study, AAV serotypes 1-9 were tested for their ability to deliver a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter into VICs in vitro. Flow cytometry results indicate AAV2 and AAV3 are capable of transducing VICs more efficiently than other serotypes. Furthermore, transduction efficiencies can be optimized by increasing the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and using self-complementary, double-stranded genomes, yielding up to 98% successfully transduced cells. Transduction of VICs by AAV2 or AAV3 in the presence of competing soluble heparin significantly reduces delivery efficiencies, suggesting heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as the primary VIC receptors of these two serotypes. Overall, this study establishes AAV2 and AAV3 as efficient gene delivery vehicles for primary VICs. Such effective delivery vectors for valve cells may be broadly useful for numerous applications, including the study of valvular cell biology, development of valve disease therapies, and regulation of genes for tissue engineering heart valves.

A number of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials utilizing AAV have been carried out worldwide (Aucoin et al., 2008; Mueller and Flotte, 2008). A number of challenges have been identified based upon data generated from these clinical trials. These challenges include (1) large scale manufacturing technologies in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), (2) tissue specific tropism of AAV vectors, (3) high-quality/high potency recombinant AAV vectors (rAAV), and (4) immune response to AAV capsids and transgene.

Considerable effort is currently being focused on AAV capsid engineering strategies with the aim of developing novel variants with enhanced tropism for specific human cell types, decreased human seroreactivity, and increased manufacturability. Selection strategies based on directed evolution rely on the generation of highly variable AAV capsid libraries using methods such as DNA-family shuffling, a technique reliant on stretches of high DNA sequence identity between input parental capsid sequences. This identity dependence for reassembly of shuffled capsids is inherently limiting and results in decreased shuffling efficiency as the phylogenetic distance between parental AAV capsids increases. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a novel codon-optimization algorithm that exploits evolutionarily defined codon usage at each amino acid residue in the parental sequences. This method increases average sequence identity between capsids, while enhancing the probability of retaining capsid functionality, and facilitates incorporation of phylogenetically distant serotypes into the DNA-shuffled libraries. This technology will help accelerate the discovery of an increasingly powerful repertoire of AAV capsid variants for cell-type and disease-specific applications."

In this system, a single plasmid containing three components, the vector sequence, the AAV rep, and cap genes, and a selectable marker gene is stably transfected into HeLaS3 cells. Producer cell lines generating an AAV2 vector expressing a secreted form of human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) have been created.

Integrated plasmid copy number in three high-producing MWs ranged from approximately 12 to 50; copies were arranged in a head-to-tail configuration.

Given the variety of applications of AAV-based vectors in the treatment of genetic disorders, numerous studies have focused on the immunogenicity of recombinant AAV. In general, AAV vectors appear not to induce strong inflammatory responses. We have found that AAV2, when it infects the osteosarcoma cells U2OS, can initiate part of its replicative cycle in the absence of helper virus. This does not occur in untransformed cells. We set out to test whether the cellular innate antiviral defenses control this susceptibility and found that, in nonimmune normal human fibroblasts, AAV2 induces type I interferon production and release and the accumulation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies. AAV fails to mobilize this defense pathway in the U2OS cells. This permissiveness is in large part due to impairment of the viral sensing machinery in these cells. Our investigations point to Toll-like receptor 9 as a potential intracellular sensor that detects AAV2 and triggers the antiviral state in AAV-infected untransformed cells. Efficient sensing of the AAV genome and the ensuing activation of an innate antiviral response are thus crucial cellular events dictating the parvovirus infectivity in host cells."

Although hepatocytes are the main target cell for AAV8, there is a loss of the viral vector because of uptake by macrophages and Kupffer cells. Reducing this loss would increase the efficacy of viral gene therapy and allow a dose reduction. The receptor mediating this uptake has not been identified; a potential candidate seems the macrophage scavenger receptor A (SR-A) that is involved in the endocytosis of, for instance, adenovirus. In this study we show that SR-A can mediate scAAV8 endocytosis and that blocking it with polyinosinic acid (poly[i]) reduces endocytosis significantly in vitro. Subsequently, we demonstrate that blocking this receptor improves scAAV-mediated liver-directed gene therapy in a model for inherited hyperbilirubinemia, the uridine diphospho-glucuronyl transferase 1A1-deficient Gunn rat. In male rats, preadministration of poly[i] increases the efficacy of a low dose (1×10¹¹ gc/kg) but not of a higher dose (3×10¹¹ gc/kg) scAAV8-LP1-UT1A1. Administration of poly[i] just before the vector significantly increases the correction of serum bilirubin in female rats. In these, the effect of poly[i] is seen by both doses but is more pronounced in the females receiving the low vector, where it also results in a significant increase of bilirubin glucuronides in bile. In conclusion, this study shows that SR-A mediates the endocytosis of AAV8 in vitro and in vivo and that blocking this receptor can improve the efficacy of AAV-mediated liver-directed gene therapy."

We compared five types of AAV mutants (AAV2 mut-triple, AAV2 sextuple, AAV8 mut447, AAV8 mut733 and AAV9 mut446) carrying a green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene. A pressure microinjection technique was used to inject either 1.5 × 10(11) vector genome (vg) AAV mutants or three dose of AAV2 sextuple into the renal cortex of rats. The microinjection approach has not been used in AAV-mediated renal gene transfer thus far. Slow and sustained microinjection enables continuous administration of the viral vector to the kidney cortex and limits any damage to the kidney, because the tip of a glass micropipette is very small. Three weeks after injection, the kidneys were collected and evaluated for GFP expression. Among the various mutated AAV serotypes studied, only AAV2 sextuple showed robust GFP expression in renal tissue.

We therefore investigated whether human PGI(2) synthase (hPGIS) gene transfer using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is still effective in a mouse model of PAH and tested for differences in the therapeutic efficacy of PAH among AAV serotypes. The PAH was induced by subjecting mice to hypoxia (10% O(2)). Type 1 AAV expressing hPGIS (AAV1-hPGIS) or type 2 AAV expressing hPGIS (AAV2-hPGIS) was injected into the thigh muscle of mice. Both vectors expressing hPGIS produced strong hPGIS protein expression in the mouse thigh skeletal muscles after 8 weeks of hypoxia. The administration of AAV1-hPGIS or AAV2-hPGIS also significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, the ratio of right ventricular weight to body weight (RV/BW), and the ratio of RV weight to left ventricular plus septal weight (RV/LV + S), and significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced increase in medial wall thickness of peripheral pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the degree of amelioration in RV systolic pressure, RV/BW, RV/LV + S, and percentage of wall thickness of peripheral pulmonary arteries between AAV1-hPGIS and AAV2-hPGIS administrations.

While commonly used serotypes, such as AAV serotypes 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, are often associated with minimal and/or dysfunctional CD8(+) T cell responses in mice, the threshold for immune activation appears to be lower in higher-order species. We have modeled this discrepancy within the mouse by identifying two capsid variants with differential immune activation profiles: AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) and a hybrid between natural rhesus isolates AAVrh32 and AAVrh33 (AAVrh32.33). Here, we aimed to characterize the structural determinants of the AAVrh32.33 capsid that augment cellular immunity to vector-encoded proteins or those of AAV8 that may induce tolerance. We hypothesized that the structural domain responsible for differential immune activation could be mapped to surface-exposed regions of the capsid, such as hypervariable regions (HVRs) I to IX of VP3. To test this, a series of hybrid AAV capsids was constructed by swapping domains between AAV8 and AAVrh32.33. By comparing their ability to generate transgene-specific T cells in vivo versus the stability of transgene expression in the muscle, we confirmed that the functional domain lies within the VP3 portion of the capsid. Our studies were able to exclude the regions of VP3 which are not sufficient for augmenting the cellular immune response, notably, HVRs I, II, and V. We have also identified HVR IV as a region of interest in conferring the efficiency and stability of muscle transduction to AAVrh32.33. "

In contrast, AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) is retrogradely transported from terminals to neuronal cell bodies in the rat brain. However, the directionality of axonal transport of AAV6 in the NHP brain has not been determined. In this study, two Cynomolgus macaques received an infusion of AAV6 harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum (caudate and putamen) by magnetic resonance (MR)-guided convection-enhanced delivery. One month after infusion, immunohistochemical staining of brain sections revealed a striatal GFP expression that corresponded well with MR signal observed during gene delivery. As shown previously in rats, GFP expression was detected throughout the prefrontal, frontal and parietal cortex, as well as the substantia nigra pars compacta and thalamus, indicating retrograde transport of the vector in NHP. AAV6-GFP preferentially transduced neurons, although a few astrocytes were also transduced. Transduction of non-neuronal cells in the brain was associated with the upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex-II and lymphocytic infiltration as previously observed with AAV1 and AAV9. This contrasts with highly specific neuronal transduction in the rat brain. Retrograde axonal transport of AAV6 from a single striatal infusion permits efficient transduction of cortical neurons in significant tissue volumes that otherwise would be difficult to achieve. "

During Ad propagation, AAV contamination needs to be detected routinely by polymerase chain reaction without symptomatic suspicion. In this study, we describe that the coinfection of either Ad wild type 5 or oncolytic Ad with AAV results in a large-plaque phenotype associated with an accelerated release of Ad from coinfected cells. This accelerated release was accompanied with the expected decrease in Ad yields in two out of three cell lines tested. Despite this lower Ad yield, coinfection with AAV accelerated cell death and enhanced the cytotoxicity mediated by Ad propagation. Intratumoral coinjection of Ad and AAV in two xenograft tumor models improved antitumor activity and mouse survival. Therefore, we conclude that accidental or intentional AAV coinfection has important implications for Ad-mediated virotherapy."

As off-target concerns complicate the therapeutic translation of site-specific DNA endonucleases, an alternative strategy to stimulate gene editing based on fragile DNA was investigated. To do this, an episomal gene-editing reporter was generated by a disruptive insertion of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) inverted terminal repeat (ITR) into the egfp gene. Compared with a non-structured DNA control sequence, the ITR induced DNA damage as evidenced by increased gamma-H2AX and Mre11 foci formation. As local DNA damage stimulates HR, ITR-mediated gene editing was investigated using DNA oligonucleotides as repair substrates. The AAV ITR stimulated gene editing >1000-fold in a replication-independent manner and was not biased by the polarity of the repair oligonucleotide. Analysis of additional human DNA sequences demonstrated stimulation of gene editing to varying degrees. In particular, inverted yet not direct, Alu repeats induced gene editing, suggesting a role for DNA structure in the repair event. Collectively, the results demonstrate that inverted DNA repeats stimulate gene editing via double-strand break repair in an episomal context and allude to efficient gene editing of the human chromosome using fragile DNA sequences."

AAVs are assembled of 60 capsomers, which can be genetically modified, allowing high-density display of short peptide sequences at their surface. The aim of our study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an adeno-associated virus-like particle (AAVLP)-displayed B-cell peptide epitope taking ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen or allergen from egg, respectively. An OVA-derived B-cell epitope was expressed as fusion protein with the AAV-2 capsid protein of VP3 (AAVLP-OVA) and for control, with the nonrelated peptide TP18 (AAVLP-TP18). Cellular internalization studies revealed an impaired uptake of AAVLP-OVA by mouse BMDC, macrophages, and human HeLa cells. Nevertheless, BALB/c mice immunized subcutaneously with AAVLP-OVA formed similarly high titers of OVA-specific IgG1 compared to mice immunized with the native OVA. The extent of the immune response was independent whether aluminum hydroxide or water in oil emulsion was used as adjuvant. Furthermore, in mice immunized with native OVA, high OVA-specific IgE levels were observed, which permitted OVA-specific mast-cell degranulation in a β-hexosaminidase release assay, whereas immunizations with AAVLP-OVA rendered background IgE levels only. Accordingly, OVA-immunized mice, but not AAVLP-OVA immunized mice, displayed an anaphylactic reaction with a significant drop of body temperature upon intravenous OVA challenge. From this mouse model, we conclude that AAVLPs that display B-cell epitope peptides on their surface are suitable vaccine candidates, especially in the field of allergy."

In contrast to nonhuman primate models, naturally occurring canine CNS diseases are common. In contrast to murine models, the dog's lifespan is long, its brain is large and the diseases affecting it commonly have the same molecular, pathological and clinical phenotype as the human diseases. We compared the ability of four intracerebrally injected adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) serotypes to transduce the dog brain with green fluorescent protein as the first step in using these vectors to evaluate both delivery and efficacy in naturally occurring canine homologs of human diseases. Quantitative measures of transduction, maximum diameter and area, identified both AAV2/9 and AAV2/rh10 as significantly more efficient than either AAV2/1 or AAV2/5 at transducing cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and internal capsule. Fluorescence co-labeling with cell-type-specific antibodies demonstrated that AAV2/9 and AAV2/rh10 were capable of primarily transducing neurons, although glial transduction was also identified and found to be more efficient with the AAV2/9 vector. These data are a prerequisite to evaluating the efficacy of recombinant AAV vectors carrying disease-modifying transgenes to treat naturally occurring canine models in preclinical studies of human CNS disease therapy.

There is no cure for PA, but dietary protein restriction and liver transplantation can attenuate its symptoms. We show here that a single intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus 2/8 (AAV8) or AAVrh10 expressing PCCA into PA hypomorphic mice decreased systemic propionylcarnitine and methyl citrate for up to 1.5 years. However, long-term phenotypic correction was always better in male mice. AAV-mediated PCCA expression was similar in most tissues in males and females at early time points and differed only in the liver. Over 1.5 years, luciferase and PCCA expression remained elevated in cardiac tissue for both sexes. In contrast, transgene expression in the liver and skeletal muscles of female, but not male, mice waned—suggesting that these tissues were major sinks for systemic phenotypic correction. These data indicate that single systemic intravenous therapy by AAV vectors can mediate long-term phenotype correction for PA. However, tissue-specific loss of expression in females reduces efficacy when compared with males. Whether similar sex-biased AAV effects occur in human gene therapy remains to be determined."

The production of strongly toxic vectors, for example for cancer-directed gene transfer, is often unfeasible due to uncontrolled expression of toxic genes in vector-producing cells. Using an approach based on transcriptional repression, we have created novel AAV vectors carrying the genes coding for diphtheria toxin A (DTA) and the pro-apoptotic PUMA protein. The DTA vector had a significant toxic effect on a panel of tumor cell lines, and abrogation of protein synthesis could be shown. The PUMA vector had a toxic effect on HeLa and RPMI 8226 cells, and sensitized transduced cells to doxorubicin. To permit targeted gene transfer, we incorporated the DTA gene into a genetically modified AAV-2 capsid previously developed by our group that mediates enhanced transduction of murine breast cancer cells in vitro. This vector had a stronger cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cells than DTA vectors with wildtype AAV capsid or vectors with a random capsid modification. The vector production and application system presented here allows for easy exchange of promotors, transgenes and capsid specificity for certain target cells. It will therefore be of great possible value in a broad range of applications in cytotoxic gene therapy and significantly broadens the spectrum of available tools for AAV-based gene therapy."

Inhibition of AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/6 and AAV2/8 transduction by human vitreous humour (VH) obtained from 80 post-mortem eye cups was investigated in this report, with clinically relevant vitreous dilutions as low as 1:2. Unexpectedly, the highest prevalence of inhibition of transduction was observed against AAV2/6, with 66% of tested samples displaying neutralisation at a 1:2 VH dilution. Only two samples showed inhibition of AAV2/8, indicating this serotype is an attractive vector for use in non-vitrectomised eyes of unscreened individuals. Levels of anti-AAV NAbs observed in the VH were much lower than previously observed in serum of a similar Australian population. Among ten tested eye cup pairs, we observed only small variation in anti-AAV NAbs levels between the left and right eye cups. Interaction with 1:2 diluted VH had an augmentation effect on AAV2/8 transduction (p = 0.004), a phenomenon which was not due to albumin or transferrin and which, if developed, might benefit the use of AAV2/8 in clinical settings."

Here, we examined recombinant AAV (rAAV) effects of a new proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, which specifically inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity and no other proteases. We determined that proteasome inhibitors act on rAAV through proteasome inhibition and not serine or cysteine protease inhibition, likely through positive changes late in transduction. "
