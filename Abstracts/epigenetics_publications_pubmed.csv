CRC is the second most common cancer-related death in both men and women globally. Chronic inflammation has been identified as one of the major risk factors of CRC. It may drive genetic and epigenetic/epigenomic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation. Current prevention modalities for CRC are limited and some treatment regimens such as use the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin may have severe side effects, namely gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Therefore, there is an urgent need of developing alternative strategies. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that several dietary cancer chemopreventive phytochemicals possess anti-inflammation and antioxidative stress activities, and may prevent cancers including CRC. Curcumin (CUR) is the yellow pigment that is found in the rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma longa). Many studies have demonstrated that CUR exhibit strong anticancer, antioxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, nuclear factor-ÎºB, and epigenetics/epigenomics pathways of histones modifications, and DNA methylation. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence in epigenetics/epigenomics alterations by CUR in CRC and their potential contribution in the prevention of CRC."

Epidemiologic studies evaluating social, behavior, family, and environmental factors have helped understand social inequality and develop the area of social epigenomics. Most of the information in social epidemiology has been gathered from genetic studies. Now the time has come that we may apply similar approaches in social epigenomics because technologies of determining methylation, histone, and noncoding RNA profiling are well developed.

Scholars from many disciplines have formulated both optimistic and cautionary claims regarding its potential normative implications. This article provides a comprehensive review of the nascent literature at the crossroads of epigenetics, ethics, law and society. It describes nine emerging areas of discussion, relating to (1) the impact of epigenetics on the nature versus nurture dualism, (2) the potential resulting biologization of the social, (3) the meaning of epigenetics for public health, its potential influence on (4) reproduction and parenting, (5) political theory and (6) legal proceedings, and concerns regarding (7) stigmatization and discrimination, (8) privacy protection and (9) knowledge translation. While there is some degree of similarity between the nature and content of these areas and the abundant literature on ethical, legal and social issues in genetics, the potential implications of epigenetics ought not be conflated with the latter. Critical studies on epigenetics are emerging within a separate space of bioethical and biopolitical investigations and claims, with scholars from various epistemological standpoints utilizing distinct yet complementary analytical approaches."

The alterations in normal DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation patterns lead to deregulated transcription and chromatin organization resulting in altered gene expression profiles that facilitates tumor development and progression. In consequence, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reversing aberrant epigenetic marks in cancer cells have been developed and used in recent molecular studies and clinical trials. Pharmaco-epigenomics is a research area, which refers to the study of epigenome changes in cancer development and how chemotherapeutic agents can reverse these aberrant epigenetic marks by targeting the epigenetic machinery. Besides, the effects of genome-wide polymorphisms in populations leading to variations in drug response are also study subject of pharmaco-epigenomics and are being studied extensively in cancer. Recent findings showed that drug response could be largely influenced by the presence of aberrant epigenetic marks of the whole genome. This implies that biological pathways and cellular processes are under the impact of epigenome status. However, data about the relationship between drug response and the epigenomic variations is still scarce mainly because the epigenome is highly variable between individuals. The present chapter reviewed the advances on the epigenetics changes mainly DNA methylation and histones modifications on cervical and breast human cancers. A special emphasis in how they could be used as targets for the development and use of novel drugs in cancer therapy is delineated."

It is recognized that environmental factors and individual lifestyles play important roles in disease susceptibility, but the link between these external risk factors and our genetics has been unclear. However, the discovery of sequence-independent heritable DNA changes (epigenetics) have helped us to explain the link between genes and the environment. Multiple diverse epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the expression of non-coding RNA molecules affect the expression of genes that produce important changes in cellular differentiation and function, influencing the health and adaptability of the organism. CVDs such as congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are now being viewed as much more complex and dynamic disorders.

The study of ecological epigenomics holds great promise to better understand the linkages between genotype, phenotype, and the environment and to explore mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. The many attributes of marine fish species, including their high diversity, variable life histories, high fecundity, impressive plasticity, and economic value provide unique opportunities for studying epigenetic mechanisms in an environmental context. To provide a primer on epigenomic research for fish biologists, we start by describing fundamental aspects of epigenetics, focusing on the most widely studied and most well understood of the epigenetic marks: DNA methylation. We then describe the techniques that have been used to investigate DNA methylation in marine fishes to date and highlight some new techniques that hold great promise for future studies. Epigenomic research in marine fishes is in its early stages, so we first briefly discuss what has been learned about the establishment, maintenance, and function of DNA methylation in fishes from studies in zebrafish and then summarize the studies demonstrating the pervasive effects of the environment on the epigenomes of marine fishes. We conclude by highlighting the potential for ongoing research on the epigenomics of marine fishes to reveal critical aspects of the interaction between organisms and their environments."

Previous studies used epigenetic data sets associated with the germline transmission of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and novel ML approaches to predict genome-wide locations of critical epimutations. A combination of Active Learning (ACL) and Imbalanced Class Learning (ICL) was used to address past problems with ML to develop a more efficient feature selection process and address the imbalance problem in all genomic data sets. The power of this novel ML approach and our ability to predict epigenetic phenomena and associated disease is suggested. The current approach requires extensive computation of features over the genome. A promising new approach is to introduce Deep Learning (DL) for the generation and simultaneous computation of novel genomic features tuned to the classification task. This approach can be used with any genomic or biological data set applied to medicine. The application of molecular epigenetic data in advanced machine learning analysis to medicine is the focus of this review.

When Waddington mentioned it in 1956, the notion of epigenetics was not yet popular, as it would become from the 1980s. However, Waddington referred first to the notion in the late 1930s. While his late allusion clearly reveals that Waddington readily associated the notion of epigenetics with the developmental process, in the contemporary uses of the notion this developmental connotation seems to have disappeared. The advent and success of molecular biology have probably contributed to focusing biologists' attention on the ""genetic"" or the ""non-genetic"" over the ""developmental"". In the present paper, I first examine the links that exist, in Waddington's work, between the classical notion of epigenesis in embryology and those of epigenetics that Waddington proposed to connect, and even synthesize, data both from embryology and genetics. Second, I show that Waddington's own view of epigenetics has changed over time and I analyze how these changes appear through his many representations (both schematic or metaphorical images) of the relationships between genetic signals and developmental processes."

They play therefore a key role in nutrition and epigenomics by fluxing monocarbons towards synthesis or methylation of DNA and RNA, and methylation of gene transregulators, respectively. The deficiency produces intrauterine growth retardation and birth dejects. Folate deficiency deregulates epigenomic mechanisms related to fetal programming through decreased cellular availability of SAM. Epigenetic mechanisms of folate deficiency are illustrated by inheritance of coat colour of agouti mice model and altered expression of Igf2/H19 imprinting genes. Dietary exposure to fumonisin FB1 acts synergistically with folate deficiency on alterations of heterochromatin assembly. Deficiency in folate and vitamin B12 produces impaired fatty acid oxidation in liver and heart through imbalanced methylation and acetylation of PGC1-alpha and decreased expression of SIRT1, and long-lasting cognitive disabilities through impaired hippocampal cell proliferation, differentiation and plasticity and atrophy of hippocampal CA1. Deciphering these mechanisms will help understand the discordances between experimental models and population studies on folate supplementation."

Most surprisingly, some epigenetic modifications may also be heritable via germ cells across generations. Epigenetics may be the missing molecular evidence of the importance of using preventive strategies at the policy level to reduce the incidence and prevalence of common diseases. But while this ""policy translation"" of epigenetics introduces new arguments in favor of public health strategies and policy-making, a more ""clinical translation"" of epigenetics is also emerging. It focuses on the biochemical mechanisms and epigenetic variants at the origin of disease, leading to novel biomedical means of assessing epigenetic susceptibility and reversing detrimental epigenetic variants. In this paper, we argue that the impetus to create new biomedical interventions to manipulate and reverse epigenetic variants is likely to garner more attention than effective social and public health interventions and therefore also to garner a greater share of limited public resources. This is likely to happen because of the current biopolitical context in which scientific findings are translated. This contemporary neoliberal ""regime of truth,"" to use a term from Michel Foucault, greatly influences the ways in which knowledge is being interpreted and implemented. Building on sociologist Thomas Lemke's Foucauldian ""analytics of biopolitics"" and on literature from the field of science and technology studies, we present two sociological trends that may impede the policy translation of epigenetics: molecularization and biomedicalization. These trends, we argue, are likely to favor the clinical translation of epigenetics-in other words, the development of new clinical tools fostering what has been called ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine. In addition, we argue that an overemphasized clinical translation of epigenetics may further reinforce this biopolitical landscape through four processes closely related to neoliberal pathways of thinking: the internalization and isolation (aspects of liberal individualism) of socioenvironmental determinants of health and increased opportunities for commodification and technologicalization (aspects of economic liberalism) of health care interventions.

While being mitotically and sometimes even meiotically transmitted, epigenetic traits often demonstrate extensive flexibility. This allows cells to acquire diverse gene expression patterns during differentiation, but also to adapt to a changing environment. However, epigenetic alterations are not always beneficial to the organism, as they are, for example, frequently identified in human diseases such as cancer. Accurate and cost-efficient genome-scale profiling of epigenetic features is thus of major importance to pinpoint these ""epimutations,"" for example, to monitor the epigenetic impact of environmental exposure. Over the last decade, the field of epigenetics has been revolutionized by several innovative ""epigenomics"" technologies exactly addressing this need. In this review, we discuss and compare widely used next-generation methods to assess DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, noncoding RNA expression, histone modifications, and nucleosome positioning. Although recent methods are typically based on ""second-generation"" sequencing, we also pay attention to still commonly used array- and PCR-based methods, and look forward to the additional advantages of single-molecule sequencing. As the current bottleneck in epigenomics research is the analysis rather than generation of data, the basic difficulties and problem-solving strategies regarding data preprocessing and statistical analysis are introduced for the different technologies. Finally, we also consider the complications associated with epigenomic studies of species with yet unsequenced genomes and possible solutions."

Epigenetic mechanisms include information-containing factors, other than DNA sequence, that cause stable changes in gene expression and are maintained during cell divisions. They represent a link between environmental influences, genome features, and the resulting phenotype. The main epigenetic factors are DNA methylation, posttranslational changes of histones, and higher-order chromatin structure. Sometimes non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are also included in the broad term of epigenetic factors. There is rapidly expanding experimental evidence for a role of epigenetic factors in the differentiation of bone cells and the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. However, different from genetic factors, epigenetic signatures are cell- and tissue-specific and can change with time. Thus, elucidating their role has particular difficulties, especially in human studies. Nevertheless, epigenomewide association studies are beginning to disclose some disease-specific patterns that help to understand skeletal cell biology and may lead to development of new epigenetic-based biomarkers, as well as new drug targets useful for treating diffuse and localized disorders.

This broad narrative conceptual review summarises main biological underpinnings of the stress-diet-obesity pathway and how new techniques can further knowledge. Cortisol seems the main biological factor from stress towards central adiposity; and diet, physical activity and sleep are the main behavioural pathways. Within stress-diet, the concepts of comfort food and emotional eating are highlighted, as cortisol affects reward pathways and appetite brain centres with a role for insulin, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), endocannabinoids, orexin and gastrointestinal hormones. More recently researched biological underpinnings are microbiota, epigenetic modifications and metabolites. First, the gut microbiota reaches the stress-regulating and appetite-regulating brain centres via the gut-brain axis. Second, epigenetic analyses are recommended as diet, obesity, stress and gut microbiota can change gene expression which then affects appetite, energy homeostasis and stress reactivity. Finally, metabolomics would be a good technique to disentangle stress-diet-obesity interactions as multiple biological pathways are involved. Saliva might be an ideal biological matrix as it allows metagenomic (oral microbiota), epigenomic and metabolomic analyses. In conclusion, stress and diet/obesity research should be combined in interdisciplinary collaborations with implementation of several -omics analyses."

Here, the evidence of the epigenetic correlates of prenatal adversities, NICU-related environment and development of preterm infants is systematically reviewed. The findings suggest that a number of prenatal adverse (e.g., maternal depression and stress) and post-natal (e.g., NICU-related pain-related stress) events affect the developmental trajectories of preterm infants and children via epigenetic alterations of imprinted and stress-related genes. Nonetheless, the potential epigenetic vestiges of early care and protective interventions in NICU have not been investigated yet and this represents a fascinating challenge for future PBE research."

It is mainly mediated by Th2 cell and IgE produced by B cells. While the pathogenesis of IgE-mediated food allergy is quite straightforward, the factors that lead to the development of food allergies at any age in children and adults are unclear. Recent studies have revealed that genetics, epigenetics, and environmental exposures contribute to the development of atopy. In this chapter, we discuss the interplay between these three key elements, reveal how epigenetic modifications may mediate genetic susceptibility of food allergies, and explain why epigenetic modifications may be the key in environmental factors mediated-gene expression, leading to the loss of immune tolerance and eventually, the initiation of food allergies. It should be noted that the study of the role of epigenetics in food allergy is still in its infancy, and lags behind research on epigenetics in other fields such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. One of the reasons for this may be the extreme complexity and variability of clinical presentation of food allergy, ranging from less severe forms such as oral allergy syndrome to full-blown anaphylaxis. Research on early exposure has disrupted the previous thinking of avoidance of food allergies to prevent sensitization in children, instead leading to recommendations that early introduction to foods may, in fact, induce tolerance. However, clear and unequivocal guidelines on how to approach this in the clinical setting have not been developed. The coming of the epigenetic era in food allergies is to provide better understanding of pathogenesis of food allergy, as well as providing therapeutic and preventive strategies for this very common condition."

Pharmacogenomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics are three omics fields that are rapidly advancing and can provide tools to identify novel asthma mechanisms and biomarkers to guide treatment. Pharmacogenomics focuses on variants in the DNA, epigenomics studies heritable changes that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence but lead to alteration of gene expression, and transcriptomics investigates gene expression by studying the complete set of mRNA transcripts in a cell or a population of cells. Advances in high-throughput technologies and statistical tools together with well-phenotyped patient inclusion and collaborations between different centers will expand our knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms involved in disease onset and progress. Furthermore, it could help to select and stratify appropriate therapeutic strategies for subgroups of patients and hopefully bring precision medicine to daily practice."

Breakthroughs in several technologies have enabled the possibility of genome-wide epigenetic research, for example the mapping of human genome-wide DNA methylation. In addition, with the development of various high-throughput and high-resolution sequencing technologies, a large number of functional noncoding RNAs have been identified. Massive studies indicated that these functional ncRNA also play an important role in epigenetics. In this review, we gain inspiration from the recent proposal of the ceRNAs hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that miRNAs act as a language of communication. Accordingly, we further deduce that all of epigenetics may functionally acquire such a unique language characteristic. In summary, various epigenetic markers may not only participate in regulating cellular processes, but they may also act as the intracellular 'language' of communication and are involved in extensive information exchanges within cell.

Epigenetic regulation plays fundamental roles in the processes of kidney cell biology through the action of DNA methylation, chromatin modifications via epigenetic regulators and interaction via transcription factors, and noncoding RNA species. Kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, pyelonephritis and polycystic kidney diseases are driven by aberrant activity in numerous signaling pathways in even individual kidney cell. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, noncoding RNAs, and protein posttranslational modifications, could disrupt essential pathways that protect the renal cells from uncontrolled growth, apoptosis and establishment of other renal associated syndromes, which have been recognized as one of the critical mechanisms for regulating functional changes that drive and maintain the kidney disease phenotype. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the epigenetic mechanisms in kidney cell biology and epigenetic basis of kidney development, and introduce epigenetic techniques that can be used in investigating the molecular mechanism of kidney cell biology and kidneys diseases, primarily focusing on the integration of DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation technologies into kidney disease associated studies. Future studies using these emerging technologies will elucidate how alterations in the renal cell epigenome cooperate with genetic aberrations for kidney disease initiation and progression. Incorporating epigenomic testing into the clinical research is essential to future studies with epigenetics biomarkers and precision medicine using emerging epigenetic therapies."

It is generally accepted that the central pathogenesis of psoriasis is a T cell-dominant immune disorder affected by multiple factors including genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, innate and adaptive immune responses, etc. However, the exact etiology is largely unknown. In recent years, epigenetic involvements, such as the DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and noncoding RNA regulation are reported to be critical for the pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, the interplay between these factors has only recently been started to be unraveled. Notably, inhibitors of enzymes that work in epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, are beginning to appear in the clinical setting to restore normal epigenetic patterns (Generali et al. in J Autoimmun 83:51-61, 2017), providing novel therapeutic potential as novel treatment targets for psoriasis. Indeed, medications previously used to treat autoimmune diseases have later been discovered to exert their action via epigenetic mechanisms.

Incompletely understood, the etiology of SjS is multi-factorial and evidence is growing to consider that epigenetic factors are playing a crucial role in its development. Independent from DNA sequence mutations, epigenetics is described as inheritable and reversible processes that modify gene expression. Epigenetic modifications reported in minor salivary gland and lymphocytes from SjS patients are related to (i) an abnormal DNA methylation process inducing in turn defective control of normally repressed genes involving such matters as autoantigens, retrotransposons, and the X chromosome in women; (ii) altered nucleosome positioning associated with autoantibody production; and (iii) altered control of microRNA. Results from epigenome-wide association studies have further revealed the importance of the interferon pathway in disease progression, the calcium signaling pathway for controlling fluid secretions, and a cell-specific cross talk with risk factors associated with SjS. Importantly, epigenetic modifications are reversible thus opening opportunities for therapeutic procedures in this currently incurable disease."

Genetics alone cannot explain sporadic cancer and cancer development in individuals with no family history or a weak family history of cancer. Epigenetics provides a mechanism to explain the development of cancer in such situations. Alterations in epigenetic profiling may provide important insights into the etiology and natural history of cancer. Because several epigenetic changes occur before histopathological changes, they can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and risk assessment. Many cancers may remain asymptomatic until relatively late stages; in managing the disease, efforts should be focused on early detection, accurate prediction of disease progression, and frequent monitoring. This chapter describes epigenetic biomarkers as they are expressed during cancer development and their potential use in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Based on epigenomic information, biomarkers have been identified that may serve as diagnostic tools; some such biomarkers also may be useful in identifying individuals who will respond to therapy and survive longer. The importance of analytical and clinical validation of biomarkers is discussed, along with challenges and opportunities in this field. "

In this article, I report from Select Biosciences Epigenetics Europe 2010 industry conference held on 14-15 September 2010 at The Burlington Hotel, Dublin, Ireland. This industry conference was extremely well attended with a global pool of delegates representing the academic research community, biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies, as well as the technology/tool developers. This conference represented the current state of the epigenetics community with cancer/oncology as a key driver. In fact, it has been estimated that approximately 45% of epigenetic researchers today identify cancer/oncology as their main area of focus vis-Ã -vis their epigenetic research efforts."

Accordingly, much effort has been devoted to characterizing these states under normal and pathological conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the most widely used method to characterize where in the genome transcription factors, modified histones, modified nucleotides and chromatin binding proteins are found; bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) and its variants are commonly used to characterize the locations of DNA modifications. Though very powerful, these methods are not without limitations. Notably, they are best at characterizing one chromatin feature at a time, yet chromatin features arise and function in combination. Investigators commonly superimpose separate ChIP-seq or BS-seq datasets, and then infer where chromatin features are found together. While these inferences might be correct, they can be misleading when the chromatin source has distinct cell types, or when a given cell type exhibits any cell to cell variation in chromatin state. These ambiguities can be eliminated by robust methods that directly characterize the existence and genomic locations of combinations of chromatin features in very small inputs of cells or ideally, single cells. Here we review single molecule epigenomic methods under development to overcome these limitations, the technical challenges associated with single molecule methods and their potential application to single cells.

Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, instruct the cell/tissue to correctly interpret external signals and adjust its functions accordingly. Given that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to environment, stable, and reversible, epigenetic studies in psychiatry could represent a promising approach to better understanding and treating disease. In the present review, we aim to discuss the clinical opportunities and challenges arising from the epigenetic research in psychiatry. Using selected examples, we first recapitulate key findings supporting the role of adverse life events, alone or in combination with genetic risk, in epigenetic programming of neuropsychiatric systems. Epigenetic studies further report encouraging findings about the use of methylation changes as diagnostic markers of disease phenotype and predictive tools of progression and response to treatment. Then we discuss the potential of using targeted epigenetic pharmacotherapy, combined with psychosocial interventions, for future personalized medicine for patients. Finally, we review the methodological limitations that could hinder interpretation of epigenetic data in psychiatry. They mainly arise from heterogeneity at the individual and tissue level and require future strategies in order to reinforce the biological relevance of epigenetic data and its translational use in psychiatry. Overall, we suggest that epigenetics could provide new insights into a more comprehensive interpretation of mental illness and might eventually improve the nosology, treatment, and prevention of psychiatric disorders."

While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of susceptible loci and candidate genes associated with the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR), the risk-associated alleles account for only a very small percent of the genetic risk. In allergic airway and other complex diseases, it is thought that epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding microRNAs, caused by complex interactions between the underlying genome and the environment may account for some of this ""missing heritability"" and may explain the high degree of plasticity in immune responses. In this chapter, we will focus on the current knowledge of classical epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation and histone modifications, and their potential role in asthma and AR. In particular, we will review epigenetic variations associated with maternal airway disease, demographics, environment, and non-specific associations. The role of specific genetic haplotypes in environmentally induced epigenetic changes are also discussed. A major limitation of many of the current studies of asthma epigenetics is that they evaluate epigenetic modifications in both allergic and non-allergic asthma, making it difficult to distinguish those epigenetic modifications that mediate allergic asthma from those that mediate non-allergic asthma. Additionally, most DNA methylation studies in asthma use peripheral or cord blood due to poor accessibility of airway cells or tissue. Unlike DNA sequences, epigenetic alterations are quite cell- and tissue-specific, and epigenetic changes found in airway tissue or cells may be discordant from that of circulating blood. These two confounding factors should be considered when reviewing epigenetic studies in allergic airway disease."

Epigenomics is the study of genome-wide epigenetic modifications. Because gene expression changes are critical in both normal development and disease progression, epigenetics is widely applicable to many aspects of biological research. The influences of nutrients and bioactive food components on epigenetic phenomena such as DNA methylation and various types of histone modifications have been extensively investigated. Because an individual's epigenetic patterns are established during early gestation and are changed and personalized by environmental factors during our lifetime, epigenetic mechanisms are quite important in the development of transgenerational and adult obesity as well as in the development of diabetes mellitus. Aging and cancer demonstrate profound genome-wide DNA methylation changes, suggesting that nutrition may affect the aging process and cancer development through epigenetic mechanisms. "

Despite remarkable progress with respect to the identification of adaptive genomic signals that are strongly associated with the ""hypoxia-tolerant"" physiological characteristics of high-altitude populations, many questions regarding the fundamental biological processes underlying human adaptation remain unanswered. Vital to address these enduring questions will be determining the role of epigenetic processes, or non-sequence-based features of the genome, that are not only critical for the regulation of transcriptional responses to hypoxia but heritable across generations. This review proposes that epigenomic processes are involved in shaping patterns of adaptation to high altitude by influencing adaptive potential and phenotypic variability under conditions of limited oxygen supply. Improved understanding of the interaction between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors holds great promise to provide deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying human adaptive potential, and clarify its implications for biomedical research."

Potato (Solanum tuberosum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are the first two sequenced genomes of asterids, and share a common polyploidization event. However, the epigenetic role of DNA methylation on the evolution of duplicated genes derived from polyploidization is not fully understood. Here, we explore the role of the DNA methylation in the evolution of duplicated genes in potato and tomato. The overall levels of DNA methylation are different, although patterns of DNA methylation are similar in potato and tomato. Different types of duplicated genes can display different methylation patterns in potato and tomato. In addition, we found that differences in the methylation levels between duplicated genes were associated with gene expression divergence. In particular, for the majority of duplicated gene pairs, one copy is always hyper- or hypo-methylated compared with the other copy across different tomato fruit ripening stages, and these genes are enriched for specific function related to transcription factor (TF) activity. Furthermore, transcription of hundreds of duplicated TFs was shown to be regulated by DNA methylation during fruit ripening stages in tomato, some of which are well-known fruit ripening TFs. Taken together, our results support the notion that DNA methylation may facilitate divergent evolution of duplicated genes and play roles in important biological processes such as tomato fruit ripening."

In fact, collectively considering multiple studies aimed at characterizing the basic pathophysiology of ASDs, a large number of genes has been proposed. Addressing the problem of molecular data interpretation using gene networks helps to explain genetic heterogeneity in terms of shared pathways. Besides, the integrative analysis of multiple omics has emerged as an approach to provide a more comprehensive view of a disease. In this work, we carry out a network-based meta-analysis of the genes reported as associated with ASDs by studies that involved genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. Collectively, our analysis provides a prioritization of the large number of genes proposed to be associated with ASDs, based on genes' relevance within the intracellular circuits, the strength of the supporting evidence of association with ASDs, and the number of different molecular alterations affecting genes. We discuss the presence of the prioritized genes in the SFARI (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative) database and in gene networks associated with ASDs by other investigations. Lastly, we provide the full results of our analyses to encourage further studies on common targets amenable to therapy."

CNV, MET, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were examined in 351 ovarian carcinoma patients. Genes for which expression was correlated with DNA copy-number or DNA methylation were identified; three ovarian carcinoma gene subtypes were defined based on these correlations. Overall survival and B cell scores were lower, while the macrophage cell score was higher, in the DNA imprinting centre 1 (iC1) subtype than in the iC2 and iC3 subtypes. Comparison of CNV, MET, and mRNA expression among the subtypes identified two genes, ubiquitin B (UBB) and interleukin 18 binding protein (IL18BP), that were associated with prognosis. Mutation spectrum results based on subtype indicated that UBB and IL18BP expression may be influenced by mutation loci. Mutation levels were higher in iC1 samples than in iC2 or iC3 samples, indicating that the iC1 subtype is associated with disease progression. This integrated multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian carcinoma and may help identify biomolecular markers for early disease diagnosis."

Epigenetic clocks, which measure changes in a few hundred specific CpG sites, can accurately predict chronological age in a variety of species, including humans. These clocks are currently the best biomarkers for predicting mortality in humans. Additionally, several studies have characterized the effects of aging across the methylome in a wide variety of tissues from humans and mice. A small fraction (~2%) of the CpG sites show age-related changes, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation with aging. Evaluation of non-CpG site methylation has only been examined in a few studies, with about ~0.5% of these sites showing a change with age. Therefore, while only a small fraction of cytosines in the genome show changes in DNA methylation with age, this represents 2 to 3 million cytosines in the genome. Importantly, the only study to compare the effect of aging on DNA methylation in male and female mice and humans found that >95% of the age-related changes in DNA methylation in the hippocampus were sexually divergent, i.e., the methylation did not differ between males and females at young age but age-related changes occurred in one sex but not the other. The age-related changes in DNA methylation tend to be enriched and under-represented in specific genomic contexts, with some commonalities between tissues and species that require further investigation. The strongest evidence that the age-related changes in DNA methylation play a role in aging comes from studies of anti-aging interventions (e.g., caloric restriction, dwarfism, and rapamycin treatment) in mice. These anti-aging interventions deaccelerate the epigenetic clocks and reverse/prevent 20 to 40% of the age-related changes in DNA methylation. It will be important in the future to demonstrate that at least some of the age-related changes in DNA methylation directly lead to alterations in the transcriptome of cells/tissues that could potentially contribute to aging."

An increased incidence and a younger age of patients are also predicted to occur, and therefore elucidation of the pathological mechanisms is important. However, several aspects of the mechanism of carcinogenesis in the endometrium remain unclear. Associations with genetic mutations of cancer-related genes have been shown, but these do not provide a complete explanation. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms have been examined. Silencing of genes by DNA hypermethylation, hereditary epimutation of DNA mismatch repair genes and regulation of gene expression by miRNAs may underlie carcinogenesis in endometrial cancer. New therapies include targeting epigenetic changes using histone deacetylase inhibitors. Some cases of endometrial cancer may also be hereditary. Thus, patients with Lynch syndrome which is a hereditary disease, have a higher risk for developing endometrial cancer than the general population. Identification of such disease-related genes may contribute to early detection and prevention of endometrial cancer."

Notably, studies of pediatric brain tumors have identified unexpected oncogenic pathways implicated in tumorigenesis. These range from a single pathway/molecule defect such as abnormalities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, considered to be a hallmark of pilocytic astrocytomas, to alterations in the epigenome as a critical component altered in many subgroups of high-grade brain tumors.

This refreshing wave of discovery has occurred concurrently with epigenetic studies of joint tissues that have examined DNA methylation, histone modifications and regulatory RNAs. These epigenetic analyses have involved investigations of joint development, homeostasis and disease and have used both human samples and animal models. What has become apparent from a comparison of these two complementary approaches is that many OA genetic risk signals interact with, map to or correlate with epigenetic mediators. This discovery implies that epigenetic mechanisms, and their effect on gene expression, are a major conduit through which OA genetic risk polymorphisms exert their functional effects. This observation is particularly exciting as it provides mechanistic insight into OA susceptibility. Furthermore, this knowledge reveals avenues for attenuating the negative effect of risk-conferring alleles by exposing the epigenome as an exploitable target for therapeutic intervention in OA."

In this review, we present a comprehensive view of epigenetic alterations accompanying reprogramming, cell maintenance and differentiation as factors that influence applications of hiPSCs in stem cell based technologies. We conclude that sample heterogeneity masks DNA methylation signatures in subpopulations of cells and thus believe that beside a genetic evaluation, extensive epigenomic screening should become a standard procedure to ensure hiPSCs state before they are used for genome editing and differentiation into neurons of interest. In particular, we suggest that exploitation of the single-cell composition of the epigenome will provide important insights into heterogeneity within hiPSCs subpopulations to fast forward development of reliable hiPSC-based analytical platforms in neurological disorders modelling and before completed hiPSC technology will be implemented in clinical approaches."

To this end, epigenetics aims to discover the molecular mechanisms that explain how different nutrients and hormones, environmental changes, and emotional, social and cognitive experiences modify gene expression and behaviors, even permanently so. Psychiatry has learned that diseases with strong genetic predisposition, such as schizophrenia, show a concordance of around 50% between monozygotic twins, thus evidencing the importance of the genetic background and the presence of environmental variables that stimulate or block phenotypic development. The interest in epigenetics has increased during the last few years due to fundamental discoveries made in molecular and behavioral genetics, although within this framework factual knowledge coexists with fictional expectations and wrong concepts. Is it possible that epigenetic variants modify temperament and human behavior? May abused or neglected children develop long-lasting epigenetic marks in their DNA? May bipolar states correlate with different epigenetic signatures? Studying these subjects in not an easy task, but experiments performed in lab animals suggest that these conjectures are reasonable, although there is still a long distance between hypotheses and scientifically proven facts."

Epigenetic mechanisms include post-translational modifications of histones, DNA methylation, chromatin conformation and non-coding RNAs. It has been observed that misregulation of epigenetic processes has been associated with human disease. We have constructed the new resource by selecting the subset of epigenetics-specific data from general-purpose archives, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus, and Sequence Read Archives, and then subjecting them to further review, annotation and reorganization. Raw data is processed and mapped to genomic coordinates to generate 'tracks' that are a visual representation of the data. These data tracks can be viewed using popular genome browsers or downloaded for local analysis. The Epigenomics resource also provides the user with a unique interface that allows for intuitive browsing and searching of data sets based on biological attributes. Currently, there are 69 studies, 337 samples and over 1100 data tracks from five well-studied species that are viewable and downloadable in Epigenomics."

The excitement in modern molecular biology surrounding the impact exerted by the environment on development of the phenotype is focused largely on mechanism and has not incorporated questions asked (and answers provided) by early philosophers, biologists, and psychologists. As such, this emergence of epigenetic studies is somewhat ""old wine in new bottles"" and represents a reformulation of the old debate of preformationism versus epigenesis-one resolved in the 1800s. Indeed, this tendency to always look forward, with minimal concern or regard of what has gone before, has led to the present situation in which ""true"" epigenetic studies are believed to consist of one of two schools. The first is primarily medically based and views epigenetic mechanisms as pathways for disease (e.g., ""the epigenetics of cancer""). The second is primarily from the basic sciences, particularly molecular genetics, and regards epigenetics as a potentially important mechanism for organisms exposed to variable environments across multiple generations. There is, however, a third, and separate, school based on the historical literature and debates and regards epigenetics as more of a perspective than a phenomenon. Against this backdrop, comparative integrative biologists are particularly well-suited to understand epigenetic phenomena as a way for organisms to respond rapidly with modified phenotypes (relative to natural selection) to changes in the environment. Using evolutionary principles, it is also possible to interpret ""sunsetting"" of modified phenotypes when environmental conditions result in a disappearance of the epigenetic modification of gene regulation. Comparative integrative biologists also recognize epigenetics as a potentially confounding source of variation in their data. Epigenetic modification of phenotype (molecular, cellular, morphological, physiological, and behavioral) can be highly variable depending upon ancestral environmental exposure and can contribute to apparent ""random"" noise in collected datasets. Thus, future research should go beyond the study of epigenetic mechanisms at the level of the gene and devote additional investigation of epigenetic outcomes at the level of both the individual organism and how it affects the evolution of populations. This review is the first of seven in this special issue of Integrative and Comparative Biology that addresses in detail these and other key topics in the study of epigenetics. "

Design specifications are fundamentally defined by the choice of analysis. As such, the focus for DNA methylation was on developing front-end analogue circuits to carry out Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) for Point-of-Care applications, and sequencing for detailed analysis. The use of MSP prompted the design of an ISFET weak inversion current mirror topology for differential sensing and reduction of drift and temperature sensitivities. The primary limitation in ion-semiconductor sequencing is base calling of repeated nucleotides known as homopolymers. Implementation of a switched current integrator can potentially increase both accuracy and window for detection, within the frequency region of DNA reactions. For quantifying miRNAs, digital back-end processing circuits were considered toward a fully portable platform that can carry out real-time monitoring of DNA amplification reactions. Two systems to evaluate threshold cycles were developed, based on the Derivative method and a new proposed 3-point exponential evaluation aim to reduce detection time simultaneously. Both implementations were tested with datasets from fluorescent qPCR reactions, as well as pH-LAMP experiments that have been optimized for on-chip amplifications. All designs were fabricated in unmodified CMOS with performance assessed based on functionality as well as pH-resolution required in practice."

New tools furnished by advances in basic science and translational medicine could help achieve this goal. This approach could reach beyond the practitioners 'eyeball' assessment or venerable markers derived from the physical examination and standard laboratory evaluation. Advances in genetics have identified novel pathways and targets that operate in numerous diseases, paving the way for 'precision medicine'.

Moreover, the related field of toxico-epigenomics, that determines chemical-induced changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and micro-RNA expression, is emerging as a valuable contribution to understanding mechanisms of both adaptive and adverse responses. Zebrafish has proven a useful and convenient model species for both transcriptomic and epigenetic toxicological studies.

Emerging evidence is consistent with the idea that epigenetic processes are involved in embedding the impact of early-life experience in the genome and mediating between social environments and later behavioral phenotypes. Whereas there is evidence supporting this hypothesis in animal studies, human studies have been less conclusive. A major problem is the fact that the brain is inaccessible to epigenetic studies in humans and the relevance of DNA methylation in peripheral tissues to behavioral phenotypes has been questioned.

Among these epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs (i.e. miRNA and lncRNA) are involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.

Indeed, with the exception of rare mutations, the human genome-sequence has remained remarkably stable over the past centuries. In contrast, substantial changes to our environment as part of our modern life style have not only led to a significant reduction of certain infectious diseases but also seen the exponential increase in complex traits including obesity and multifactorial diseases such as autoimmune disorders. It is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic mechanisms operate at the interface between the genetic code and our environment, and a large body of existing evidence supports the importance of environmental factors such as diet and nutrition, infections, and exposure to toxins on human health. This seems to be particularly the case during vulnerable periods of human development such as pregnancy and early life. Importantly, as the first point of contact for many of such environmental factors including nutrition, the digestive system is being increasingly linked to a number of ""modern"" pathologies.

Specifically, aberrant DNA and histone modifications which silence tumor suppressor genes or promote oncogenes have been demonstrated in multiple cancer models. While the role of epigenetics in several solid tumor cancers such as colorectal cancer are well established, there is emerging evidence that epigenetics also plays a critical role in breast and prostate cancer. In breast cancer, DNA methylation profiles have been linked to hormone receptor status and tumor progression. Similarly in prostate cancer, epigenetic patterns have been associated with androgen receptor status and response to therapy. The regulation of key receptor pathways and activities which affect clinical therapy treatment options by epigenetics renders this field high priority for elucidating mechanisms and potential targets. A new set of methylation arrays are now available to screen epigenetic changes and provide the cutting-edge tools needed to perform such investigations. The role of nutritional interventions affecting epigenetic changes particularly holds promise. Ultimately, determining the causes and outcomes from epigenetic changes will inform translational applications for utilization as biomarkers for risk and prognosis as well as candidates for therapy.

Measurements that are increasingly available range from those that identify transcription factor occupancy and initiation of transcription to long-lasting and heritable epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Together with techniques in which cell lineage is recorded, this multilayered information will provide insights into a cell's past history and its future potential. This will allow new levels of understanding of cell fate decisions, identity, and function in normal development, physiology, and disease."

This volume highlights the latest in laboratory and bioinformatic techniques used for the investigation of epigenetic phenomena in plants. Such techniques now allow genome-wide analyses of epigenetic regulation and help to advance our understanding of how epigenetic regulatory mechanisms affect cellular and genome function. To set the scene, we begin with a short background of how the field of epigenetics has evolved, with a particular focus on plant epigenetics. We consider what has historically been understood by the term ""epigenetics"" before turning to the advances in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics which have led to current-day definitions of the term. Following this, we pay attention to key discoveries in the field of epigenetics that have emerged from the study of unusual and enigmatic phenomena in plants. Many of these phenomena have involved cases of non-Mendelian inheritance and have often been dismissed as mere curiosities prior to the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms. In the penultimate section, consideration is given to how advances in molecular techniques are opening the doors to a more comprehensive understanding of epigenetic phenomena in plants. We conclude by assessing some opportunities, challenges, and techniques for epigenetic research in both model and non-model plants, in particular for advancing understanding of the regulation of genome function by epigenetic mechanisms.

Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, can mediate these interactions and may also trigger long-lasting adaptations in developmental programs that increase the risk of major depressive disorders (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Early life adversity is a major risk factor for MDD/SCZ and can trigger persistent genome-wide changes in DNA methylation at genes important to early, but also to mature, brain function, including neural proliferation, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, among others. Moreover, genetic variations controlling dynamic DNA methylation in early life are thought to influence later epigenomic changes in SCZ. This finding corroborates the high genetic load and a neurodevelopmental origin of SCZ and shows that epigenetic responses to the environment are, at least in part, genetically controlled. Interestingly, genetic variants influencing DNA methylation are also enriched in risk variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on SCZ supporting a role in neurodevelopment. Overall, epigenomic responses to early life adversity appear to be controlled to different degrees by genetics in MDD/SCZ, even though the potential reversibility of epigenomic processes may offer new hope for timely therapeutic interventions in MDD/SCZ."

A MULTICENTER APPROACH TO THE HISTORY OF EPIGENETICS (1901-1975).,2015,Med Secoli,,"['Rossella Costa', 'Giulia Frezza']",[],"The origin of epigenetics has been traditionally traced back to Conrad Hal Waddington's foundational work in 1940s. The aim of the present paper is to reveal a hidden history of epigenetics, by means of a multicenter approach. Our analysis shows that genetics and embryology in early XX century--far from being non-communicating vessels--shared similar questions, as epitomized by Thomas Hunt Morgan's works. Such questions were rooted in the theory of epigenesis and set the scene for the development of epigenetics. Since the 1950s, the contribution of key scientists (Mary Lyon and Eduardo Scarano), as well as the discussions at the international conference of Gif-sur-Yvette (1957) paved the way for three fundamental shifts of focus: 1. From the whole embryo to the gene; 2. From the gene to the complex extranuclear processes of development; 3. From cytoplasmic inheritance to the epigenetics mechanisms."

In contrast to the impressive pace at which advances have been made at the level of the medulloblastoma genome, comparable studies of the epigenome have lagged behind. Complementary data yielded from genomic sequencing and copy number profiling have verified frequent targeting of chromatin modifiers in medulloblastoma, highly suggestive of prominent epigenetic deregulation in the disease. Past studies of DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing and microRNA expression analyses further support the concept of medulloblastoma as an epigenetic disease. In this Review, we aim to summarize the key findings of past reports pertaining to medulloblastoma epigenetics as well as recent and ongoing genomic efforts linking somatic alterations of the genome with inferred deregulation of the epigenome. In addition, we predict what is on the horizon for medulloblastoma epigenetics and how aberrant changes in the medulloblastoma epigenome might serve as an attractive target for future therapies. "

After high dose radio- or chemo-therapy, recipient's hematopoiesis is replaced by a new immunosystem and residual malignant cells are eliminated by the graft-versus-leukemia reaction. The benefit of this immunological effect is limited by the most frequent complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: graft-versus-host disease. In addition to their well-known anti-tumor activity, epigenetic drugs mediate immunotolerance without reducing alloreactivity or even enhance graft-versus-leukemia effect without inducing graft-versus-host disease by regulating cytokine release, increasing the circulating number of regulatory T cells and interacting with natural killer cells. We focus on the use of epigenetic drugs in the allogeneic transplantation setting in relation to their anti-tumor and immunomodulatory potential."

By contrast, epigenetic aberrations are commonly found in RCC, indicating that epigenetic reprogramming is an important event in RCC development. Epigenetic alterations comprise several different aberrations, such as changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNA levels, and occur in the most important signalling pathways in RCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, the WNT-Î²-catenin pathway, and pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Owing to their involvement in these pathways and frequent occurrence in RCC, epigenetic alterations are regarded as potential biomarkers for the early detection of disease and for prediction of prognosis and treatment response. In addition, most of these alterations are potentially reversible, so they also provide new targets for therapy. At the moment, epigenetic biomarkers for RCC are not being used in clinical practice, but targeted epigenetic therapies are under investigation. Understanding the extent of epigenetic changes occurring in RCC and the mechanisms by which they influence disease progression and treatment response, as well as knowledge of current research on biomarkers and treatments, is crucial to successful clinical translation of epigenetics in RCC."

Each analyzed SNP pair consists of one SNP in a putative active enhancer and another SNP in a putative physically interacting gene promoter in a trait-relevant tissue. As a proof-of-principle case study, we used this approach to identify focused collections of SNP pairs that we analyzed in three independent Type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS. This approach led us to discover 35 significant SNP pairs, encompassing both novel signals and signals for which we have found orthogonal support from other sources. Nine of these pairs are consistent with eQTL results, two are consistent with our own capture C experiments, and seven involve signals supported by recent T2D literature."

Furthermore, recent research has provided evidence for an altered epigenomic landscape in disease-relevant cell populations. Although still in the early phase, epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation and microRNAs, might have potential for assisting in the stratification of patients for treatment and complement or replace in the future biochemical or clinical tests. The first epigenetic biomarkers correlating with the successful outcome of immunotherapy have been reported, and with personalized treatment options being rolled out, epigenetic modifications might well play a role in monitoring or even predicting the response to tailored therapy. However, further studies in larger cohorts with well-defined phenotypes in specific cell populations need to be performed before their implementation. Furthermore, the epigenome provides an interesting target for therapeutic intervention, with microRNA mimics, inhibitors, and antisense oligonucleotides being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with other diseases. Selection or engineering of populations of extracellular vesicles and epigenetic editing represent novel tools for modulation of the cellular phenotype and responses, although further technological improvements are required. Moreover, interactions between the host epigenome and the microbiome are increasingly recognized, and interventions of the microbiome could contribute to modulation of the epigenome with a potential effect on the overall goal of prevention of allergic diseases."

The field is guided by biological principles active during development, wound healing, aging, and carcinogenesis. Skeletal development and tissue maintenance in adults represent highly intricate biological processes that require continuous adjustments in the expression of cell type-specific genes that generate, remodel, and repair the skeletal extracellular matrix. Errors in these processes can facilitate musculoskeletal disease including cancers or injury. The fundamental molecular mechanisms by which cell type-specific patterns in gene expression are established and retained during successive mitotic divisions require epigenetic control, which we review here. We focus on epigenetic regulatory proteins that control the mammalian epigenome at the level of chromatin with emphasis on proteins that are amenable to drug intervention to mitigate skeletal tissue degeneration (e.g., osteoarthritis and osteoporosis). We highlight recent findings on a number of druggable epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferases (e.g., DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) and hydroxylases (e.g., TET1, TET2, and TET3), histone methyltransferases (e.g., EZH1, EZH2, and DOT1L) as well as histone deacetylases (e.g., HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC7) and histone acetyl readers (e.g., BRD4) in relation to the development of bone or cartilage regenerative drug therapies. We also review how histone mutations lead to epigenomic catastrophe and cause musculoskeletal tumors. The combined body of molecular and genetic studies focusing on epigenetic regulators indicates that these proteins are critical for normal skeletogenesis and viable candidate drug targets for short-term local pharmacological strategies to mitigate musculoskeletal tissue degeneration.

As an alternative link between genes and disease, recent efforts have focused on mechanisms that alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Known as epigenetic mechanisms, these include DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and, most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns have been associated with disease. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to outline the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to genomic function, particularly in the development of complex behavioral phenotypes, focusing on the sensitive periods."

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of LCH and its characteristic clinical heterogeneity, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic diversity in primary LCH lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified multiple recurrent types of LCH cells within these biopsies, including putative LCH progenitor cells and several subsets of differentiated LCH cells. We confirmed the presence of proliferative LCH cells in all analyzed biopsies using IHC, and we defined an epigenomic and gene-regulatory basis of the different LCH-cell subsets by chromatin-accessibility profiling. In summary, our single-cell analysis of LCH uncovered an unexpected degree of cellular, transcriptomic, and epigenomic heterogeneity among LCH cells, indicative of complex developmental hierarchies in LCH lesions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study sketches a molecular portrait of LCH lesions by combining single-cell transcriptomics with epigenome profiling. We uncovered extensive cellular heterogeneity, explained in part by an intrinsic developmental hierarchy of LCH cells.

Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from fasting blood of study participants with BD (nâ=â32). The methylation analysis of the ARNTL CG site cg05733463 was performed by bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA with the Epitect kit, PCR and pyrosequencing. Additionally, DNA was extracted from stool samples and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. QIIME was used to analyze microbiome data. Results Methylation status of the ARNTL CpG position cg05733463 correlated significantly with bacterial diversity (Simpson index: r= -0.389, pâ=â 0.0238) and evenness (Simpson evenness index: r= -0.358, pâ=â 0.044).

Interestingly, gut microbiome diversity and evenness correlate negatively with methylation of ARNTL, which is known to regulate monoamine oxidase A transcription. We propose that alterations in overall diversity of the gut microbiome represent an internal environmental factor that has an epigenetic impact on the clock gene ARNTL which is thought to be involved in BD pathogenesis."

In this article, we consider evidence that prenatal nutrition is linked to epigenetic outcomes in offspring and schizophrenia in offspring, and that schizophrenia is associated with epigenetic changes. We focus upon one-carbon metabolism as a mediator of the pathway between perturbed prenatal nutrition and the subsequent risk of schizophrenia. Although post-mortem human studies demonstrate DNA methylation changes in brains of people with schizophrenia, such studies cannot establish causality. We suggest a testable hypothesis that utilizes a novel two-step Mendelian randomization approach, to test the component parts of the proposed causal pathway leading from prenatal nutritional exposure to schizophrenia. Applied here to a specific example, such an approach is applicable for wider use to strengthen causal inference of the mediating role of epigenetic factors linking exposures to health outcomes in population-based studies."

By extension, this new perspective has implications for risk and risk management of antisocial behaviour where there is a biological component, such as psychopathy. Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with repeat displays of antisocial behaviour, and is associated with the disproportionate imposition of harm on communities. Despite advances in our knowledge of psychopathic individuals, the construct remains complex and is hampered by a lack of integration across a range of fundamental domains. The clinical and forensic research on psychopathy is brought into conversation with the emerging field of epigenetics to highlight critical issues of (1) clinical definition and diagnosis, (2) assessment, (3) aetiology of psychopathic phenotypes, and (4) treatment and rehabilitation approaches. Broader ethical and legal questions of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the management of psychopathy beyond the criminal justice arena are also outlined."

We examine research on the potential role of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs in the regulation of gene expression in these insects. DNA methylation patterns in orthopteroids share a number of characteristics with those of hymenopteran insects, although methylation levels are much higher, and extend to introns and repeat elements.

It includes changes related to telomere shortening, cell senescence and epigenetic modifications. These processes accumulate over the lifespan. Research studies show that epigenetic signaling contributes to human disease, tumorigenesis and aging. Epigenetic DNA modifications involve changes in the gene activity but not in the DNA sequence. An epigenome consists of chemical modifications to the DNA and histone proteins without the changes in the DNA sequence. These modifications strongly depend on the environment, could be reversible and are potentially transmittable to daughter cells. Epigenetics includes DNA methylation, noncoding RNA interference, and modifications of histone proteins. Sirtuins, a family of nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzymes, are involved in the cell metabolism and can regulate many cellular functions including DNA repair, inflammatory response, cell cycle or apoptosis. Literature shows the strong interconnection between sirtuin expression and aging processes. However, the direct relationship is still unknown. Here, we would like to summarize the existing knowledge about epigenetic processes in aging, especially those related to sirtuin expression. Another objective is to explain why some negative correlations between sirtuin activity and the rate of aging can be assumed."

Second, a cell-specific mitochondrial DNA content (copy number) and mitochondrial activity determine the methylation pattern of nuclear genes. Third, mitochondrial DNA variants influence the nuclear gene expression patterns and the nuclear DNA (ncDNA) methylation levels. Fourth and most recent line of evidence indicates that mitochondrial DNA similar to ncDNA also is subject to epigenetic modifications, particularly by the 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine marks. The latter interaction of mitochondria with epigenetics has been termed 'mitochondrial epigenetics'. Here we summarize recent developments in this particular area of epigenetic research. Furthermore, we propose the term 'mitoepigenetics' to include all four above-noted types of interactions between mitochondria and epigenetics, and we suggest a more restricted usage of the term 'mitochondrial epigenetics' for molecular events dealing solely with the intra-mitochondrial epigenetics and the modifications of mitochondrial genome."

Compelling data suggested a strong causal link between prenatal vulnerability of future parental epigenomes to damaging environmental factors aggravated by abnormal socio-cultural conditions (including, for instance, malnutrition and chronic stress) and the alarming risk of developing heritable complex medical conditions later in life, such as asthma, autism, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, schizophrenia and a whole range of rare neuromuscular pathologies.

Joint diseases, including inflammatory spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, are the most common extraintestinal manifestations of CD and share more genetic susceptibility loci than any other inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) trait. The high frequency and overlap with genes associated with infectious diseases, specifically Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD), suggest that CD may represent an evolutionary adaptation to environmental microbes. Elucidating the diversity of the enteric microbiota and the protean mucosal immune responses in individuals may personalize microbiome-targeted therapies and molecular classifications of CD.

Within the family of de novo DNA methyltransferases two active enzymes, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, are responsible for the establishment of the proper cytosine methylation profile during development. Defects in DNMT3s function correlate with pathogenesis and progression of monogenic diseases and cancers. Among monogenic diseases, Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is the only Mendelian disorder associated with DNMT3B mutations and DNA methylation defects of satellite and non-satellite regions. Similar CpG hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and gene-specific hypermethylation are observed in many types of cancer. DNA hyper-methylation sites provide targets for the epigenetic therapy. Generally, we can distinguish two groups of epi-drugs affecting DNMTs activity, i) nucleoside inhibitors, covalently trapping the enzymes, and bringing higher cytotoxic effect and (ii) nonnucleoside inhibitors, which block their active sites, showing less side-effects. Moreover, combining drugs targeting chromatin and those targeting DNA methylation enhances the efficacy of the therapy and gives more chances of patient recovery. However, development of more specific and effective epigenetic therapies requires more complete understanding of epigenomic landscapes. Here, we give an overview of the recent findings in the epigenomics field, focusing on those related to DNA methylation defects in disease pathogenesis and therapy. "

The molecular mechanism for the establishment and maintenance of these states is not fully understood and remains challenging to study with existing experimental techniques. Here, we took a data-driven approach and parameterized an information-theoretic model to infer the formation mechanism of domain-level chromatin states from genome-wide epigenetic modification profiles. This model reproduces statistical correlations among histone modifications and identifies well-known states. Importantly, it predicts drastically different mechanisms and kinetic pathways for the formation of euchromatin and heterochromatin. In particular, long, strong enhancer and promoter states grow gradually from short but stable regulatory elements via a multistep process. On the other hand, the formation of heterochromatin states is highly cooperative, and no intermediate states are found along the transition path. This cooperativity can arise from a chromatin looping-mediated spreading of histone methylation mark and supports collapsed, globular three-dimensional conformations rather than regular fibril structures for heterochromatin. We further validated these predictions using changes of epigenetic profiles along cell differentiation. Our study demonstrates that information-theoretic models can go beyond statistical analysis to derive insightful kinetic information that is otherwise difficult to access."

Second, we show on this basis that epigenetics has progressively turned its main focus from biological problems regarding development, toward issues concerning evolution. Yet, both these different epistemological aspects of epigenetics still coexist. Third, we claim that the classical opposition between epigenesis and preformationism as ways of thinking about the developmental process is part of the history of epigenetics and has contributed to its current various meanings. With these objectives in mind, we first show how Waddington introduced the term ""epigenetics"" in a biological context in order to solve a developmental problem, and we then build on this by presenting Nanney's, Riggs' and Holliday's definitions, which form the basis for the current conception of ""molecular epigenetics"". Then, we show that the evo-devo research field is where some particular uses of epigenetics have started shifting from developmental issues to evolutionary problems. We also show that epigenetics has progressively focused on the issue of epigenetic inheritance within the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis' framework.

Recent data based on profiling of the DNA methylome of PCOS in different tissues provided consistent molecular evidence in support of epidemiological findings on disease comorbidity suggesting a possible autoimmune basis in the pathogenesis of the disease. We show that the field of epigenetics and epigenomics could serve to link molecular regulatory mechanisms with disease development and disease manifestation which could contribute to PCOS prevention and treatment and eventually promote reproductive health in fertile age women.

The emerging tools of epigenetics can be used as preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic markers. With the development of drugs that target the specific epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression, development and utilization of epigenetic tools are an appropriate and effective approach that can be clinically applied to the treatment of various diseases."

The plant somatic embryogenesis process provokes many epigenetics changes including DNA methylation and histone modification. Recently, an elite cotton Jin668, with an extremely high regeneration ability, was developed from its maternal inbred Y668 cultivar using a Successive Regeneration Acclimation (SRA) strategy. To reveal the underlying mechanism of SRA, we carried out a genome-wide single-base resolution methylation analysis for nonembryogenic calluses (NECs), ECs, somatic embryos (SEs) during the somatic embryogenesis procedure and the leaves of regenerated offspring plants. Jin668 (R4) regenerated plants were CHH hypomethylated compared with the R0 regenerated plants of SRA process. The increase in CHH methylation from NEC to EC was demonstrated to be associated with the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) and the H3K9me2-dependent pathway. Intriguingly, the hypomethylated CHH differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of promoter activated some hormone-related and WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes during the somatic embryogenesis process. Inhibiting DNA methylation using zebularine treatment in NEC increased the number of embryos. Our multi-omics data provide new insights into the dynamics of DNA methylation during the plant tissue culture and regenerated offspring plants. This study also reveals that induced hypomethylation (SRA) may facilitate the higher plant regeneration ability and optimize maternal genetic cultivar."

Genetic studies, including candidate gene association studies, genome-wide association studies, and whole-exome sequencing have supported the notion that while genetic susceptibility to SSc appears to be modest, SSc patients are genetically predisposed to this disease. The strongest genetic association for SSc lies within the MHC region, with loci in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DOA1 being the most replicated. The non-HLA genes associated with SSc are involved in various functions, with the most robust associations including genes for B and T cell activation and innate immunity. Other pathways include genes involved in extracellular matrix deposition, cytokines, and autophagy. Among these genes, IRF5, STAT4, and CD247 were replicated most frequently while SNPs rs35677470 in DNASE1L3, rs5029939 in TNFAIP3, and rs7574685 in STAT4 have the strongest associations with SSc. In addition to genetic predisposition, it became clear that environmental factors and epigenetic influences also contribute to the development of SSc. Epigenetics, which refers to studies that focus on heritable phenotypes resulting from changes in chromatin structure without affecting the DNA sequence, is one of the most rapidly expanding fields in biomedical research. Indeed extensive epigenetic changes have been described in SSc. Alteration in enzymes and mediators involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as dysregulated non-coding RNA levels all contribute to fibrosis, immune dysregulation, and impaired angiogenesis in this disease. Genes that are affected by epigenetic dysregulation include ones involved in autoimmunity, T cell function and regulation, TGFÎ² pathway, Wnt pathway, extracellular matrix, and transcription factors governing fibrosis and angiogenesis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current findings of SSc genetic susceptibility, followed by an extensive description and a systematic review of epigenetic research that has been carried out to date in SSc. We also summarize the therapeutic potential of drugs that affect epigenetic mechanisms, and outline the future prospective of genomics and epigenomics research in SSc."

Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors or be part of normal developmental program. In eukaryotes, DNA wraps on a histone octamer (two copies of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) to form nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin. The structure of chromatin is subjected to a dynamic regulation through multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), chromatin remodeling and noncoding RNAs. As conserved regulatory mechanisms in gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms participate in almost all the important biological processes ranging from basal development to environmental response. Importantly, all of the major epigenetic mechanisms in mammalians also occur in plants. Plant studies have provided numerous important contributions to the epigenetic research. For example, gene imprinting, a mechanism of parental allele-specific gene expression, was firstly observed in maize; evidence of paramutation, an epigenetic phenomenon that one allele acts in a single locus to induce a heritable change in the other allele, was firstly reported in maize and tomato. Moreover, some unique epigenetic mechanisms have been evolved in plants. For example, the 24-nt siRNA-involved RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is plant-specific because of the involvements of two plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V. A thorough study of epigenetic mechanisms is of great significance to improve crop agronomic traits and environmental adaptability. In this review, we make a brief summary of important progress achieved in plant epigenetics field in China over the past several decades and give a brief outlook on future research prospects. We focus our review on DNA methylation and histone PTMs, the two most important aspects of epigenetic mechanisms."

A large number of recently available data reveal the immense flexibility and potential of variable epigenomic landscapes. Such epigenomic impacts and variability are determined by a number of epigenetic regulators and several crucial inheritable epialleles, respectively. This article highlights the correlation of the epigenomic landscape with growth, flowering, reproduction, non-coding RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, transposon mobility and even heterosis in rice.

While genetic factors undoubtedly play a role in determining individual susceptibility to weight gain and obesity, the identified genetic variants only explain part of the variation. This has led to growing interest in understanding the potential role of epigenetics as a mediator of gene-environment interactions underlying the development of obesity and its associated comorbidities. Initial evidence in support of a role of epigenetics in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was mainly provided by animal studies, which reported epigenetic changes in key metabolically important tissues following high-fat feeding and epigenetic differences between lean and obese animals and by human studies which showed epigenetic changes in obesity and T2DM candidate genes in obese/diabetic individuals. More recently, advances in epigenetic methodologies and the reduced cost of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have led to a rapid expansion of studies in human populations. These studies have also reported epigenetic differences between obese/T2DM adults and healthy controls and epigenetic changes in association with nutritional, weight loss, and exercise interventions. There is also increasing evidence from both human and animal studies that the relationship between perinatal nutritional exposures and later risk of obesity and T2DM may be mediated by epigenetic changes in the offspring. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent developments in this rapidly moving field, with a particular focus on human EWAS and studies investigating the impact of nutritional and lifestyle factors (both pre- and postnatal) on the epigenome and their relationship to metabolic health outcomes. The difficulties in distinguishing consequence from causality in these studies and the critical role of animal models for testing causal relationships and providing insight into underlying mechanisms are also addressed. In summary, the area of epigenetics and metabolic health has seen rapid developments in a short space of time.

Among the environmental factors associated with IBD, diet plays an important role in modulating the gut microbiome, influencing epigenetic changes, and, therefore, could be applied as a therapeutic tool to improve the disease course. Nevertheless, the current dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management are scarce and have weak evidence. This review summarises the current knowledge on the complex interactions between diet, microbiome and epigenetics in IBD. Whereas an overabundance of calories and some macronutrients increase gut inflammation, several micronutrients have the potential to modulate it. Immunonutrition has emerged as a new concept putting forward the importance of vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E, and D, folic acid, beta carotene and trace elements such as zinc, selenium, manganese and iron. However, when assessed in clinical trials, specific micronutrients exerted a limited benefit. Beyond nutrients, an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern as a complex intervention approach has become popular in recent years. Hence, exclusive enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease is the only nutritional intervention currently recommended as a first-line therapy. Other nutritional interventions or specific diets including the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyol (FODMAP) diet and, most recently, the Mediterranean diet have shown strong anti-inflammatory properties and show promise for improving disease symptoms. More work is required to evaluate the role of individual food compounds and complex nutritional interventions with the potential to decrease inflammation as a means of prevention and management of IBD."

Further, this review describes how drug therapy can influence, and be influenced by, these mechanisms. Drugs with epigenetic mechanisms are already in use, with many more likely to be approved within the next few years.

In addition, the review contains commentary regarding the possible ways in which epigenomic changes may contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions and disorders and ways in which epigenotyping might be cross-correlated with clinical phenotyping in the context of precision medicine. The review begins with a basic description of epigenetic marking in the CNS and how these changes are powerful regulators of gene readout. Means for characterizing the individual epigenotype are briefly described, with a focus on DNA cytosine methylation as a readily measurable, stable epigenetic mark. This background enables a discussion of how ""epigenotyping"" might be integrated along with genotyping and deep phenotyping as a means of implementing advanced precision medicine. Finally, the commentary addresses two exemplars when considering how epigenotype may correlate with and modulate cognitive and behavioral phenotype: schizophrenia and Rett syndrome. These two disorders provide an interesting compare-and-contrast example regarding possible epigenotypic regulation of behavior: whereas Rett syndrome is clearly established as being caused by disruption of the function of an epigenetic ""reader"" of the DNA cytosine methylome-methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)-the case for a role for epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia is still quite speculative."

Psoriasis and PsA are multifactorial diseases that result from complex interactions of environmental and genetic risk factors. Epigenetic marks, which are labile chemical marks with diverse functions, form a layer of biological information that sits at the interface of genetics and the environment. Aberrant epigenetic regulation has been previously implicated in other rheumatological disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the nascent literature on epigenetics in psoriasis and PsA. A systematic review yielded 52 primary articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized template and study quality assessed using a methodological quality checklist. Studies reflect a broad range of epigenetic sub-disciplines, the most common being DNA methylation, followed by the parent of origin effect or genomic imprinting, expression or activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, and histone modifications. Epidemiological studies demonstrating excessive paternal transmission provided the earliest evidence of epigenetic deregulation in psoriatic disease, however few studies have examined its molecular mechanisms. Methylation studies evolved rapidly from low resolution global to targeted analyses of known psoriatic disease susceptibility loci such as HLA-C*0602. The recent explosion of epigenome-wide association studies has provided us with novel insights into psoriasis pathogenesis, and the mechanism of action of UVB, methotrexate, and anti-TNF therapies, as well as molecular signatures of psoriasis that may have clinical relevance. Finally, recent studies of pharmacological inhibitors of epigenetic modifier enzymes demonstrate their potential applicability as novel treatment modalities for psoriasis. Challenges of epigenetics research in psoriasis and PsA were identified and future perspectives are discussed herein."

The Chinese Famine (1959-1961), as a contributor to the nation's current national T2DM epidemic, provides an important and urgent public health warning. The effects of the famine give a strong message that research and actions that address the prevention of T2DM cannot be confined to lifestyle measures, as used in the landmark Da Qing study and the lifestyle prevention programmes and pharmaceutical interventions used in Western nations. To stem the T2DM epidemic, a new paradigm for prevention of T2DM must be developed.

The word was coined in the mid-twentieth century as a descriptor of how intrinsic, yet largely unknown, forces act with genes to channel progenitor cells along pathways of differentiation. Near the end of the twentieth century, epigenetics was defined more specifically as the study of changes in gene activity states. In some definitions, only those activity states that are inherited across cell division were considered. Other definitions were broader, also including activity states that are transient, or occurring in non-dividing cells. The greatest point of disagreement in these current definitions, is if the term should concern only inherited activity states. To alleviate this disparity, an alternative term, 'memigenetics', could be used in place of epigenetics to describe inherited chromatin activity states. The advantage of this term is that it is self-defining, and would serve to emphasize the important concept of cell memory. It would also free the term epigenetics to be used in a broader sense in accord with the meaning of the prefix 'epi', that is, as a descriptor of what is 'over' DNA at any point in time. "

But the toll and genetics of CHDs in Africa has seldom been systematically investigated. We present an expert review on CHD with lessons learned on Africa. We found variable CHD phenotype prevalence in Africa across countries and populations. There are important gaps and paucity in genomic studies of CHD in African populations. Among the available genomic studies, the key findings in Africa were variants in GATA4 (P193H), MTHFR 677TT, and MTHFR 1298CC that were associated with atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect (VSD), Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and patent ductus arteriosus phenotypes and 22q.11 deletion, which is associated with TOF.

Moreover, offsprings born to preeclamptic mothers exhibit an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mental disorders during adulthood. This suggests that preeclampsia not only exposes the mother and the fetus to complications during pregnancy but also programs chronic diseases during adulthood in the offspring. The etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, with various theories being suggested to explain its origin. It is primarily thought to be associated with poor placentation and entails excessive maternal inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established now that the maternal immune system and the placenta are involved in a highly choreographed cross talk that underlies adequate spiral artery remodeling required for uteroplacental perfusion and free flow of nutrients to the fetus. Although it is not clear whether immunological alterations occur early during pregnancy, studies have proposed that dysregulated systemic and placental immunity contribute to impaired angiogenesis and the onset of preeclampsia. Recently emerged strong evidence suggests a potential link among epigenetics, microRNAs (miRNAs), and pregnancy complications. This chapter will focus on important aspects of epigenetics, immunological aspects, and cardiovascular and vascular remodeling of preeclampsia."

Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to establish a correlation between exposure to EDC and human disorders. Conventional detection of EDCs is based on chemical structure and concentration sample analysis. However, substantial evidence has emerged, suggesting that cell exposure to EDCs leads to epigenetic changes, independently of its chemical structure with non-monotonic low-dose responses. Consequently, a paradigm shift in toxicology assessment of EDCs is proposed based on a comprehensive review of analytical techniques used to evaluate the epigenetic effects. Fundamental insights reported elsewhere are compared in order to establish DNA methylation analysis as a viable method for assessing endocrine disruptors beyond the conventional study approach of chemical structure and concentration analysis."

Rapidly evolving methodologies of exposure assessment and the conceptual framework of the Exposome, first introduced in 2005, are new frontiers of environmental research. Metabolomics and adductomics provide remarkable opportunities for a better understanding of exposure and prediction of potential adverse health outcomes. Metabolomics, the study of metabolism at whole-body level, involves assessment of the total repertoire of small molecules present in a biological sample, shedding light on interactions between gene expression, protein expression, and the environment. Advances in genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics are generating multidimensional structures of biomarkers of effect and susceptibility, increasingly important for the understanding of molecular mechanisms and the emergence of personalized medicine. Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation and miRNA expression, attract increasing attention as potential links between the genetic and environmental determinants of health and disease. Unlike genetics, epigenetic mechanisms could be reversible and an understanding of their role may lead to better protection of susceptible populations and improved public health."

Alterations in DNA methylation patterns at imprinting control centers have been reported by some studies to occur more frequently in children with imprinting disorders conceived by ART compared with spontaneous conception, though these findings are not consistently demonstrated and controversy has surrounded the strength of these associations. The rarity of imprinting disorders with a reliance of studies on disease registry cohorts, wide variations in ART protocols, and a lack of proper control groups limit the ability to substantiate associations between imprinting disorders and ART. Large, prospective cohort studies with a focus on molecular etiologies of these conditions are needed to discern whether a true association exists. Based on current evidence, the absolute risk of imprinting disorders after ART is low and screening for imprinting disorders in children conceived by ART is not warranted."

Functional studies in model organisms and humans indicate that epigenetic changes have a huge influence on the aging process. These epigenetic changes occur at various levels, including reduced bulk levels of the core histones, altered patterns of histone posttranslational modifications and DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered noncoding RNA expression, during both organismal aging and replicative senescence. The end result of epigenetic changes during aging is altered local accessibility to the genetic material, leading to aberrant gene expression, reactivation of transposable elements, and genomic instability. Strikingly, certain types of epigenetic information can function in a transgenerational manner to influence the life span of the offspring. Several important conclusions emerge from these studies: rather than being genetically predetermined, our life span is largely epigenetically determined; diet and other environmental influences can influence our life span by changing the epigenetic information; and inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes can influence life span of model organisms. These new findings provide better understanding of the mechanisms involved in aging. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic information, these studies highlight exciting avenues for therapeutic intervention in aging and age-associated diseases, including cancer."

This feature has stimulated a vast body of research on potential predictive markers of clinical response, with promising but often inconclusive findings. Pharmacogenetics of mood stabilizers has provided valuable hints toward the involvement of genes and pathways in modulating response. However, with the exception of lithium, the number of studies is still too sparse to draw definite conclusions. Moreover, the mechanism of action of these drugs has yet to be completely elucidated. A growing body of research has explored the effect of mood stabilizers on a family of molecular players responsible for the regulation of gene expression without interfering with the DNA sequence. These processes belong to the epigenetic machinery and represent the mechanisms through which our biological systems interact with environmental factors, including drug treatments.

There are three main and interrelated mechanisms: DNA methylation, post-translational modification of histone proteins and non-coding RNA. Gene activation is generally associated with lower levels of DNA methylation in promoters and with distinct histone marks such as acetylation of amino acids in histones. Unlike the genetic code, the epigenome is altered by endogenous (e.g. hormonal) and environmental (e.g. diet, exercise) factors and changes with age. Recent evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of common rheumatic disease, including RA, OA, SLE and scleroderma. Epigenetic drift has been implicated in age-related changes in the immune system that result in the development of a pro-inflammatory status termed inflammageing, potentially increasing the risk of age-related conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica. Therapeutic targeting of the epigenome has shown promise in animal models of rheumatic diseases.

However, progression of seizure activity as well as the development of drug-resistance remains difficult to predict, irrespective of the underlying epileptogenic condition, i.e., traumatic brain injury, developmental brain lesions, brain tumors or genetic inheritance. Mutated DNA sequences in genes encoding for ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors have been identified in hereditary focal or generalized epilepsies, but genotype-phenotype correlations are poor, arguing for additional factors determining the effect of a genetic predisposition. The dynamics of epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelling, and non-coding RNAs) provide likely explanations for common features in epilepsy and other complex diseases, including late onset, parent-of-origin effects, discordance of monozygotic twins, and fluctuation of symptoms. In addition, many focal epilepsies, including focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), glio-neuronal tumors (e.g. ganglioglioma), or temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), do not seem to primarily associate with hereditary traits, suggesting other pathogenic mechanisms.

In light of these breakthroughs, now is a particularly opportune time to develop a framework that will guide and facilitate exceptional studies in Ecological Epigenetics. Toward this goal, the Ecological Epigenetics symposium brought together researchers with diverse strengths in theory, developmental genetics, ecology, and evolution, and the proceedings from their talks are presented in this issue. By characterizing environmentally dependent epigenetic variation in natural populations, we will enhance our understanding of developmental, ecological, and evolutionary phenomena. In particular, ecological epigenetics has the potential to explain how populations endure (or fail to endure) profound and rapid environmental change. Here, my goal is to introduce some of the common goals and challenges shared by those pursuing this critical field. "

Findings revealed significant epigenetic effects in an assortment of genes that are implicated in the etiology of depression, suicidality, callous-unemotional traits, and chronic and intergenerational aggressive behavior. Several polymorphisms that mediate the HPA axis, neurotransmission, immune response, brain development, serotonin synthesis, and other processes were found.

Epigenetic inheritance of phenotypes mediated by DNA methylation is well established in plants. Most of the known mechanisms of establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation have been worked out in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Major functions of DNA methylation in plants include regulation of gene expression and silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and repetitive sequences, both of which have parallels in mammalian biology, involve interaction with the transcriptional machinery, and may have profound effects on the regulatory networks in the cell. Methylome and transcriptome dynamics have been investigated in development and environmental responses in Arabidopsis and agriculturally and ecologically important plants, revealing the interdependent relationship among genomic context, methylation patterns, and expression of TE and protein coding genes. Analyses of methylome variation among plant natural populations and species have begun to quantify the extent of genetic control of methylome variation vs. true epimutation, and model the evolutionary forces driving methylome evolution in both short and long time scales. The ability of DNA methylation to positively or negatively modulate binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs) provides a natural link from genome sequence and methylation changes to transcription. Technologies that allow systematic determination of methylation sensitivities of TFs, in native genomic and methylation context without confounding factors such as histone modifications, will provide baseline datasets for building cell-type- and individual-specific regulatory networks that underlie the establishment and inheritance of complex traits.

Targeting these epigenetic alterations will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of addiction and might even yield more effective anti-addiction therapies. However, the complexity of the neuroepigenetic landscape makes it difficult to determine which drug-induced epigenetic changes causally contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of drug addiction. In this review, we highlight the evidence that epigenetic modifications, specifically histone modifications, within key brain reward regions are correlated with addiction. We then discuss the emerging field of locus-specific neuroepigenetic editing, which is a promising method for determining the causal epigenetic molecular mechanisms that drive an addicted state. Such approaches will substantially increase the field's ability to establish the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying drug addiction, and could lead to novel treatments for addictive disorders."

However, whether this non-random 3D organization only reflects or indeed contributes-and how-to the regulation of genome function remain to be elucidated. The observation in many species that 3D domains correlate strongly with the 1D epigenomic information along the genome suggests a dynamic coupling between chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. Here, we posit that chromosome folding may contribute to the maintenance of a robust epigenomic identity via the formation of spatial compartments like topologically-associating domains. Using a novel theoretical framework, the living chromatin model, we show that 3D compartmentalization leads to the spatial colocalization of epigenome regulators, thus increasing their local concentration and enhancing their ability to spread an epigenomic signal at long-range. Interestingly, we find that the presence of 1D insulator elements, like CTCF, may contribute greatly to the stable maintenance of adjacent antagonistic epigenomic domains. We discuss the generic implications of our findings in the light of various biological contexts from yeast to human. Our approach provides a modular framework to improve our understanding and to investigate in details the coupling between the structure and function of chromatin."

In the 1910s, Mendelian genetics fused with the chromosomal theory of inheritance, giving rise to what is still called 'classical genetics'. Within this framework, the gene is simultaneously a unit of function and transmission, a unit of recombination, and of mutation. Until the early 1950s, these concepts of the gene coincided.

The current study mainly focuses on strategies to enhance the fungal potential to produce resveratrol via the activation of the cryptic biosynthetic pathway with their particular interest in the antioxidant application. The endophytic fungus Xylaria psidii was isolated from the surface sterilized leaf of Vitis vinifera. With the help of HPLC analysis it is found that resveratrol concentration was maximum and enhanced in case of treatment with 5Â Î¼m SAHA (52.32Â Î¼g/mL) and by 10Â Î¼m AZA (48.94Â Î¼g/mL) followed by 10Â Î¼m SAHA (41.10Â Î¼g/mL) and 5Â Î¼m AZA (37.72Â Î¼g/mL). After treatment with different concentration of epigenetic modifiers such as HDAC inhibitors (SAHA) and dMNTs (AZA) inhibitors, a significant increase in antioxidant potential was obtained. In the case of DPPH increase in scavenging potential was found as compared to wild strain. Treatment with 5Â Î¼m SAHA and by 10Â Î¼m AZA was showing strong antioxidant potential among all the epigenetic variants as compared to wild strain. In the case of TEAC also the same trend as in the case of DPPH was obtained."

Within a single class of ciliates, Paramecium and Tetrahymena species have long been known to present a wide variety of mating type numbers and modes of inheritance, but only recently have the genes involved been identified. Although similar transmembrane proteins mediate self/nonself recognition in both ciliates, the mechanisms of mating type determination differ widely, ranging from Mendelian systems to developmental nuclear differentiation, either stochastic or maternally inherited. The non-Mendelian systems rely on programmed editing of the germline genome that occurs during differentiation of the somatic nucleus, and they have co-opted different DNA recombination mechanisms-some previously unknown. Here we review the recent molecular advances and some remaining unsolved questions and discuss the possible implications of these diverse mechanisms for inbreeding/outbreeding balance regulation."

Recent work in rodents points to a role for epigenetics in the development or maintenance of neural sex differences, although genome-wide studies have so far been lacking. Here we review the existing literature on epigenetics and brain sexual differentiation and present preliminary analyses on the genome-wide distribution of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation in a sexually dimorphic brain region in male and female mice. H3K4me3 is a histone mark primarily organized as 'peaks' surrounding the transcription start site of active genes. We microdissected the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and preoptic area (BNST/POA) in adult male and female mice and used ChIP-Seq to compare the distribution of H3K4me3 throughout the genome. We found 248 genes and loci with a significant sex difference in H3K4me3. Of these, the majority (71%) had larger H3K4me3 peaks in females. Comparisons with existing databases indicate that genes and loci with increased H3K4me3 in females are associated with synaptic function and with expression atlases from related brain areas. Based on RT-PCR, only a minority of genes with a sex difference in H3K4me3 has detectable sex differences in expression at baseline conditions. Together with previous findings, our data suggest that there may be sex biases in the use of epigenetic marks. Such biases could underlie sex differences in vulnerabilities to drugs or diseases that disrupt specific epigenetic processes. "
