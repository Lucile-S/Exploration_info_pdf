32053662,PMC7018046,AMPKα Subunit Ssp2 and Glycogen Synthase Kinases Gsk3/Gsk31 are involved in regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in fission yeast.,2020,PLoS One,10.1371/journal.pone.0228845,"['Hao Miao', 'Qiannan Liu', 'Guanglie Jiang', 'Wen Zhang', 'Kun Liu', 'Xiang Gao', 'Yujie Huo', 'Si Chen', 'Toshiaki Kato', 'Norihiro Sakamoto', 'Takayoshi Kuno', 'Yue Fang']",[],"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a highly conserved family of membrane-bound transcription factors, is an essential regulator for cellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in mammalian cells. Sre1, the homolog of SREBP in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), regulates genes involved in the transcriptional responses to low sterol as well as low oxygen. Previous study reported that casein kinase 1 family member Hhp2 phosphorylated the Sre1 N-terminal transcriptional factor domain (Sre1N) and accelerated Sre1N degradation, and other kinases might exist for regulating the Sre1 function. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the Sre1 activity and to identify additional kinases involved in regulation of Sre1 function, we developed a luciferase reporter system to monitor the Sre1 activity through its binding site called SRE2 in living yeast cells. Here we showed that both ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and hypoxia-mimic CoCl2 caused a dose-dependent increase in the Sre1 transcription activity, concurrently, these induced transcription activities were almost abolished in Δsre1 cells. Surprisingly, either AMPKα Subunit Ssp2 deletion or Glycogen Synthase Kinases Gsk3/Gsk31 double deletion significantly suppressed ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors- or CoCl2-induced Sre1 activity. Notably, the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 mutant showed further decreased Sre1 activity when compared with their single or double deletion. Consistently, the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 mutant showed more marked temperature sensitivity than any of their single or double deletion. Moreover, the fluorescence of GFP-Sre1N localized at the nucleus in wild-type cells, but significantly weaker nuclear fluorescence of GFP-Sre1N was observed in Δssp2, Δgsk3Δgsk31, Δssp2Δgsk3, Δssp2Δgsk31 or Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 cells. On the other hand, the immunoblot showed a dramatic decrease in GST-Sre1N levels in the Δgsk3Δgsk31 or the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 cells but not in the Δssp2 cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that Gsk3/Gsk31 may regulate Sre1N degradation, while Ssp2 may regulate not only the degradation of Sre1N but also its translocation to the nucleus."

Although the FASN transcriptional regulatory mechanism has been elucidated clearly in many tumor cells, its mechanism is still not clear in the ruminant mammary gland. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a 1.8-kb fragment of the FASN 5' flanking region from goat genomic DNA. Multiple alignment analysis demonstrated that the entire 1.8-kb fragment has little homology but that the sub-section nearest the transcriptional start site (-203 to +1) is more conserved across species, in particular the binding motifs for transcriptional regulation. Deletion analysis revealed a putative core promoter region located in -297/-14 bp upstream of the transcription site within the high homology domain. Mutations of sterol response elements (SRE1 and SRE2) and the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) binding site appeared to significantly down-regulate the FASN promoter activity in goat mammary epithelial cells (P<0.05). Further analysis showed that both SRE sites responded to sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1). SREBP-1 overexpression and knockdown by small interference RNA influenced the abundance of endogenous FASN. These data suggested that SREBP-1 may regulate FASN expression at the transcriptional level in the lactating goat mammary gland. Hence, the current work will contribute valuable information to understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of FASN during lactation."

We isolated a novel gene regulatory element from CHO-K1 cells, designated E77, which was found to enhance the stable expression of a transgene. A genomic library was constructed by combining CHO-K1 genomic DNA fragments with a CMV promoter-driven GFP expression vector, and the E77 element was isolated by screening. The incorporation of the E77 regulatory element resulted in the generation of an increased number of clones with high expression, thereby enhancing the expression level of the transgene in the stable transfectant cell pool. Interestingly, the E77 element was found to consist of two distinct fragments derived from different locations in the CHO genome shotgun sequence. High and stable transgene expression was obtained in transfected CHO cells by combining these fragments. Additionally, the function of E77 was found to be dependent on its site of insertion and specific orientation in the vector construct. Our findings demonstrate that stable gene expression mediated by the CMV promoter in CHO cells may be improved by the isolated novel gene regulatory element E77 identified in the present study. "

Developing new therapeutic methods for these conditions requires a comprehensive understanding between hepatic lipid metabolism and IR. Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) are the major regulators of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. They are induced by insulin, which directly binds to the sterol regulatory elements (SRE) or carbohydrate-responsive elements (ChORE) of the FASN promoter to induce its expression. The insulin pathway involved in NAFLD has well studied, but the role of histone modification in NAFLD is just beginning to be investigated, and there is minimal data regarding its involvement. In the current study, we investigated histone modifications in FASN under insulin stimulation. H3K4 hypertrimethylation and H3, H4 hyperacetylation in the FASN promoter was found in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes following insulin stimulation. We also found that insulin treatment induced the transcription factor SREBP-1c, ChREBP and could accelerate FASN expression by enhancing SREBP-1c, SRE, and ChREBP ChORE binding and inducing H3, H4 hyperacetylation at SRE, ChORE, or transcription start site (TSS) regions of the FASN promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and primary hepatocytes. Finally, histone acetylation could influence FASN expression by impairing SREBP-1c SRE and ChREBP ChORE binding."

This protocol includes detailed instructions for design and cloning of gRNA libraries, construction of endogenous reporter cell lines via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of fluorescent proteins, overall screen design, and recovery of the gRNA library for enrichment analysis.

To develop novel antiviral drugs, a better understanding of HBV gene expression regulation is vital. One important aspect is to understand how HBV hijacks the cellular machinery to export unspliced RNA from the nucleus. The HBV post-transcriptional regulatory element (HBV PRE) has been proposed to be the HBV RNA nuclear export element. However, the function remains controversial, and the core element is unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to identify functional regulatory elements within the HBV PRE and investigate their functions. Using bioinformatics programs based on sequence conservation and conserved RNA secondary structures, three regulatory elements were predicted, namely PRE 1151-1410, PRE 1520-1620 and PRE 1650-1684. PRE 1151-1410 significantly increased intronless and unspliced luciferase activity in both HepG2 and COS-7 cells. Likewise, PRE 1151-1410 significantly elevated intronless and unspliced HBV surface transcripts in liver cancer cells. Moreover, motif analysis predicted that PRE 1151-1410 contains several regulatory motifs. This study reported the roles of PRE 1151-1410 in intronless transcript nuclear export and the splicing mechanism. Additionally, these results provide knowledge in the field of HBV RNA regulation. Moreover, PRE 1151-1410 may be used to enhance the expression of other mRNAs in intronless reporter plasmids. "

Using CRISPR-Cas9 system, we generated multiple founder pigs containing 12 different mutant alleles around a regulatory element within the intron 3 of IGF2 gene. Crossing two male founders passed four mutant alleles onto F1 generation, and these mutations abolished repressor ZBED6 binding and rendered this regulatory element nonfunctional. Both founders and F1 animals showed significantly faster growth, without affecting meat quality. These results indicated that editing IGF2 intron 3-3072 site using CRISPR-Cas9 technology improved meat production in Bama pigs. This is the first demonstration that editing non-coding region can improve economic traits in livestock."

However, the initial process involved in such cis-regulatory changes remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated this process by analyzing the duplicated hand1 genes of Xenopus laevis (hand1.L and hand1.S), which were generated by allotetraploidization 17-18 million years ago, and compared these with their single ortholog in the ancestral-type diploid species X. tropicalis. A dN/dS analysis indicated that hand1.L and hand1.S are still under purifying selection, and thus, their products appear to retain ancestral functional properties. RNA-seq and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that hand1.L and hand1.S have similar expression patterns to each other and to X. tropicalis hand1, but the hand1.S expression level was much lower than the hand1.L expression level in the primordial heart. A comparative sequence analysis, luciferase reporter analysis, ChIP-PCR analysis, and transgenic reporter analysis showed that a single nucleotide substitution in the hand1.S promoter was responsible for the reduced expression in the heart. These findings demonstrated that a small change in the promoter sequence can trigger diversification of duplicated gene expression prior to diversification of their encoded protein functions in a young duplicated genome."

We used it to interrogate the 2-Mb POU5F1 locus in human embryonic stem cells, and identified 45 cis-regulatory elements. A majority of these elements have active chromatin marks, DNase hypersensitivity, and occupancy by multiple transcription factors, which confirms the utility of chromatin signatures in cis-element mapping. Notably, 17 of them are previously annotated promoters of functionally unrelated genes, and like typical enhancers, they form extensive spatial contacts with the POU5F1 promoter. These results point to the commonality of enhancer-like promoters in the human genome."

We gained the optimal classifier and predicted genome-wide SNPs to discover susceptibility regulatory variants. We further utilized Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis Consortium (GEFOS) and three in-house GWASs samples to validate the associations for predicted positive SNPs. The random forest classifier performed best among all machine learning methods with the F1 score of 0.8871. Using the optimized model, we predicted 37,584 candidate SNPs for osteoporosis. According to the meta-analysis results, a list of regulatory variants was significantly associated with osteoporosis after multiple testing corrections and contributed to the expression of known osteoporosis-associated protein-coding genes. In summary, combining GWASs and regulatory elements through machine learning could provide additional information for understanding the mechanism of osteoporosis. The regulatory variants we predicted will provide novel targets for etiology research and treatment of osteoporosis."

In medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), the Autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene plays an essential role in this process by driving the expression of a diverse set of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which are presented and help tolerize self-reactive thymocytes. Interestingly, Aire has a highly tissue-restricted pattern of expression, with only mTECs and peripheral extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) known to express detectable levels in adults. Despite this high level of tissue specificity, the cis-regulatory elements that control Aire expression have remained obscure. Here, we identify a highly conserved noncoding DNA element that is essential for Aire expression. This element shows enrichment of enhancer-associated histone marks in mTECs and also has characteristics of being an NF-κB-responsive element. Finally, we find that this element is essential for Aire expression in vivo and necessary to prevent spontaneous autoimmunity, reflecting the importance of this regulatory DNA element in promoting immune tolerance."

The pectin content of primary cell walls in grasses and dicots is distinctly different. Polygalacturonases (PGs) can degrade pectins and participate in multiple developmental processes of plants. This study comprehensively compared the evolution, expression, and cis-regulatory element of PGs in grasses and dicots. A total of 577 PGs identified from five grasses and five dicots fell into seven clades. Evolutionary analysis demonstrated the distinct differences between grasses and dicots in patterns of gene duplication and loss, and evolutionary rates. Grasses generally contained much fewer clade C and F members than dicots. We found that this disparity was the result of less duplication and more gene losses in grasses. More duplications occurred in clades D and E, and expression analysis showed that most of clade E members were expressed ubiquitously at a high overall level and clade D members were closely related to male reproduction in both grasses and dicots, suggesting their biological functions were highly conserved across species. In addition to the general role in reproductive development, PGs of clades C and F specifically played roles in root development in dicots, shedding light on organ differentiation between the two groups of plants. A regulatory element analysis of clade C and F members implied that possible functions of PGs in specific biological responses contributed to their expansion and preservation. This work can improve the knowledge of PGs in plants generally and in grasses specifically and is beneficial to functional studies."

Early examples of regulatory mechanisms of human diseases involve large chromosomal rearrangements that change the regulatory connections within the genome. Single nucleotide variants in regulatory elements can also contribute to disease, potentially via demonstrated associations with changes in transcription factor binding, enhancer activity, post-translational histone modifications, long-range enhancer-promoter interactions, or RNA polymerase recruitment. Establishing causality between non-coding genetic variants, gene regulation, and disease has recently become more feasible with advances in genome-editing and epigenome-editing technologies. As establishing causal regulatory mechanisms of diseases becomes routine, functional annotation of target genes is likely to emerge as a major bottleneck for translation into patient benefits. In this review, we discuss the history and recent advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of human disease, and new challenges likely to be encountered once establishing those mechanisms becomes rote."

In day 15.5 mouse embryos, a link promoter fragment spanning -1020 to +40 nucleotides demonstrated highly specific β-galactosidase staining of skeletal structures, including the appendicular and axial cartilaginous tissues.

Electromobility shift assays demonstrated binding of Hox-B4 recombinant protein to the HLBS, which was eliminated with nucleotide substitutions within the core-binding element. Co-transfection analysis of the HLBS demonstrated a 22-fold transcriptional activation by HoxA9 expression, which was ablated with a substitution within the core HLBS element.

Despite its important roles, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms controlling DHCR24 gene expression. We analysed the proximal promoter region and the cholesterol-mediated regulation of DHCR24. A putative SRE (sterol-regulatory element) at -98/-90 bp of the transcription start site was identified. Other putative regulatory elements commonly found in SREBP (SRE-binding protein)-targeted genes were also identified. Sterol responsiveness was analysed by luciferase reporter assays of approximately 1 kb 5'-flanking region of the human DHCR24 gene in HepG2 and SK-N-MC cells. EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays demonstrated cholesterol-dependent recruitment and binding of SREBPs to the putative SRE. Given the presence of several CACCC-boxes in the DHCR24 proximal promoter, we assessed the role of KLF5 (Krüppel-like factor 5) in androgen-regulated DHCR24 expression. DHT (dihydrotestosterone) increased DHCR24 expression synergistically with lovastatin. However, DHT was unable to activate the DHCR24 proximal promoter, whereas KLF5 did, indicating that this mechanism is not involved in the androgen-induced stimulation of DHCR24 expression. The results of the present study allow the elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of the DHCR24 gene by cholesterol availability and identification of other putative cis-acting elements which may be relevant for the regulation of DHCR24 expression."

The Nodal gene is not expressed in adult tissues but is frequently activated in cancer cells, contributing to progression toward malignancy. Although several regulatory elements of the Nodal gene have been identified, the epigenetic mechanisms by which Nodal expression is regulated over the long term remain unclear. We found a region exhibiting dynamic changes in DNA methylation at approximately -3.0 kb to -0.4 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) that we termed the epigenetic regulatory element (ERE). The ERE was unmethylated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) but became increasingly methylated in differentiated cells and tissues, concomitant with the downregulation of Nodal mRNA expression. In vitro reporter assays identified an Oct3/4 binding motif within the ERE, indicating that the ERE is responsible for the activation of Nodal in mESCs. Furthermore, the ERE was a target of differentiation-associated Polycomb silencing, and the chromatin condensed when mESCs differentiated to embryoid bodies (EBs). Pharmacological inhibition of PRC2 led to the reactivation of Nodal expression in EBs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The ERE was also targeted by PRC2 in normal human cells. In NODAL-expressing human cancer cells, accumulation of EZH2 and trimethylation of H3K27 at the ERE were diminished. In conclusion, Nodal is epigenetically controlled through the ERE in the mouse embryo and human cells. "

However, examples of adaptive regulatory polymorphism are rare, especially those that have been characterized at both the molecular genetic level and the organismal level. In this study, we perform a functional analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster CG9509 enhancer, a cis-regulatory element that shows evidence of adaptive evolution in populations outside the species' ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa. Using site-directed mutagenesis and transgenic reporter gene assays, we determined that 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms are responsible for the difference in CG9509 expression that is observed between sub-Saharan African and cosmopolitan populations. Interestingly, while 2 of these variants appear to have been the targets of a selective sweep outside of sub-Saharan Africa, the variant with the largest effect on expression remains polymorphic in cosmopolitan populations, suggesting it may be subject to a different mode of selection. To elucidate the function of CG9509, we performed a series of functional and tolerance assays on flies in which CG9509 expression was disrupted. We found that CG9509 plays a role in larval growth and influences adult body and wing size, as well as wing loading. Furthermore, variation in several of these traits was associated with variation within the CG9509 enhancer. The effect on growth appears to result from a modulation of active ecdysone levels and expression of growth factors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selection acted on 3 sites within the CG9509 enhancer to increase CG9509 expression and, as a result, reduce wing loading as D. melanogaster expanded out of sub-Saharan Africa."

However, the final targets and biological functions of most ATL E3 ligases are still unknown. We analyzed the co-expression networks among grapevine ATL genes across a set of transcriptomic data related to defense and abiotic stress, combined with a condition-independent dataset. This revealed strong correlations between ATL proteins and diverse signal transduction components and transcriptional regulators, in particular those involved in immunity. An enrichment analysis of cis-regulatory elements in ATL gene promoters and related co-expressed genes highlighted the importance of hormones in the regulation of ATL gene expression. Our work identified several ATL proteins as candidates for further studies aiming to decipher specific grapevine resistance mechanisms activated in response to pathogens."

In addition, two different FSHB mRNA transcripts resulting from the linked mutations of genomic DNA were discovered in mutation-bearing bull pituitaries. Here, using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we identified c.-1539_-1538delGGinsTTAACT mutations in the 5'-URR that generated a novel cis-regulatory element in bovine FSHB. Moreover, this novel element seemed to play a role in repressing FSHB transcription based on a promoter activity analysis in LβT2 gonadotrope cells. Quantitative assays of FSHB mRNA in the bovine pituitaries suggested that the levels of FSHB wild-type transcripts in the mutation-bearing bulls were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in those of bulls without FSHB genetic mutations and that the levels of FSHB-mutated transcripts were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of wild-type transcripts in the mutation-bearing bulls. Altogether, our results suggest that decreased serum FSH levels and male fertility in bulls with the c.-1539_-1538delGGinsTTAACT mutation likely result from the alteration of cis-regulatory elements and induction of FSHB transcription.

The locus encoding this lncRNA, which we termed Rroid, directly interacted with the promoter of its neighboring gene, Id2, in group 1 ILCs. Moreover, the Rroid locus, but not the lncRNA itself, controlled the identity and function of ILC1s by promoting chromatin accessibility and deposition of STAT5 at the promoter of Id2 in response to interleukin (IL)-15.

In particular, little is known about the effects of mutations within cis binding sites for transcription factors, or the nature of epistatic interactions between these mutations. Here, we tested the effects of single and double mutants in two cis binding sites involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli araBAD operon, a component of arabinose metabolism, using a synthetic system. This system decouples transcriptional control from any posttranslational effects on fitness, allowing a precise estimate of the effect of single and double mutations, and hence epistasis, on gene expression. We found that epistatic interactions between mutations in the araBAD cis-regulatory element are common, and that the predominant form of epistasis is negative. The magnitude of the interactions depended on whether the mutations are located in the same or in different operator sites. Importantly, these epistatic interactions were dependent on the presence of arabinose, a native inducer of the araBAD operon in vivo, with some interactions changing in sign (e.g., from negative to positive) in its presence. This study thus reveals that mutations in even relatively simple cis-regulatory elements interact in complex ways such that selection on the level of gene expression in one environment might perturb regulation in the other environment in an unpredictable and uncorrelated manner."

Recent studies suggested that members of the AP2/ERF domain-containing RAV (related to ABI3/VP1) TF family are involved in abiotic stress adaptation. However, the transcriptional response of rice RAV genes (OsRAVs) to salt has not yet been fully characterized. In this study, the expression patterns of all five OsRAVs were examined under salt stress. Only one gene, OsRAV2, was stably induced by high-salinity treatment. Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the stress response at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of OsRAV2 (P OsRAV2 ). Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment. Serial 5' deletions and site-specific mutations in P OsRAV2 revealed that a GT-1 element located at position -664 relative to the putative translation start site is essential for the salt induction of P OsRAV2 . The regulatory function of the GT-1 element in the salt induction of OsRAV2 was verified in situ in plants with targeted mutations generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system. Taken together, our results indicate that the GT-1 element directly controls the salt response of OsRAV2. This study provides a better understanding of the putative functions of OsRAVs and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of plant genes under salt stress. "

The RNAs of the major human pathogen, hepatitis B virus (HBV) contain a large (~600 bases) composite cis-acting 'post-transcriptional regulatory element' (PRE). This element promotes expression from these naturally intronless transcripts. Indeed, the related woodchuck hepadnavirus PRE (WPRE) is used to enhance expression in gene therapy and other expression vectors. These PRE are likely to act through a combination of mechanisms, including promotion of RNA nuclear export. Functional components of both the HBV PRE and WPRE are 2 conserved RNA cis-acting stem-loop (SL) structures, SLα and SLβ. They are within the coding regions of polymerase (P) gene, and both P and X genes, respectively. Based on previous studies using mutagenesis and/or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), here we propose 2 covariance models for SLα and SLβ. The model for the 30-nucleotide SLα contains a G-bulge and a CNGG(U) apical loop of which the first and the fourth loop residues form a CG pair and the fifth loop residue is bulged out, as observed in the NMR structure. The model for the 23-nucleotide SLβ contains a 7-base-pair stem and a 9-nucleotide loop. Comparison of the models with other RNA structural elements, as well as similarity searches of human transcriptome and viral genomes demonstrate that SLα and SLβ are specific to HBV transcripts.

Further, using a system level genetic resource, we prove that the genetic regulation is exerted through histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) repressor protein.

Multiple forms of repression are used to prevent Oskar protein from accumulating at sites other than the oocyte posterior. Activation is mediated by several types of cis-acting elements, which presumably control different forms of activation. We characterize a 5' element, positioned in the coding region for the Long Osk isoform and in the extended 5' UTR for translation of the Short Osk isoform. This element was previously thought to be essential for osk mRNA translation, with a role in posterior-specific release from repression. From our work, which includes assays which separate the effects of mutations on RNA regulatory elements and protein coding capacity, we find that the element is not essential, and conclude that there is no evidence supporting a role for the element only at the posterior of the oocyte. The 5' element has a redundant role, and is only required when Long Osk is not translated from the same mRNA. Mutations in the element do disrupt the anchoring function of Long Osk protein through their effects on the amino acid sequence, a confounding influence on interpretation of previous experiments. "

We discovered that injecting 2-cell stage embryos with a plasmid bearing a ϕC31 integrase-targeted attB element and two dual β-globin HS4 insulators flanking a reporter transgene in opposite orientations relative to each other yielded persistent expression with sufficiently high penetrance for characterizing the activity of the promoter without having to coinject integrase RNA. Expression began appropriately during development and persisted into swimming tadpole stages without perturbing the expression of the cognate endogenous gene. Coinjected plasmids having the same elements but expressing different reporter proteins were reliably coexpressed within the same cells, providing a useful control for variations in injections between animals.

Transgenic reporter expression was maintained in LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells upon infection, although short-term, in vitro activation led to a down-regulation of E8VI activity.

Although examples of parallel evolution have implicated recurrent modification of the same gene and cis-regulatory element (CRE), little is known about the mutational and molecular paths of parallel CRE evolution. In Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, the Bric-à-brac (Bab) transcription factors control the development of a suite of sexually dimorphic traits on the posterior abdomen. Female-specific Bab expression is regulated by the dimorphic element, a CRE that possesses direct inputs from body plan (ABD-B) and sex-determination (DSX) transcription factors. Here, we find that the recurrent evolutionary modification of this CRE underlies both intraspecific and interspecific variation in female pigmentation in the melanogaster species group. By reconstructing the sequence and regulatory activity of the ancestral Drosophila melanogaster dimorphic element, we demonstrate that a handful of mutations were sufficient to create independent CRE alleles with differing activities. Moreover, intraspecific and interspecific dimorphic element evolution proceeded with little to no alterations to the known body plan and sex-determination regulatory linkages. Collectively, our findings represent an example where the paths of evolution appear biased to a specific CRE, and drastic changes in function were accompanied by deep conservation of key regulatory linkages.

Studies of mammalian cartilage formation were greatly advanced through the use of a cartilage specific regulatory element of the Collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1) gene. In an effort to isolate such an element in zebrafish, we compared the expression of two col2a1 homologues and found that expression of col2a1b, a previously uncharacterized zebrafish homologue, only partially overlaps with col2a1a. We focused our analysis on col2a1a, as it is expressed in both the stacked chondrocytes and the perichondrium. By comparing the genomic sequence surrounding the predicted transcriptional start site of col2a1a among several species of teleosts we identified a small highly conserved sequence (R2) located 1.7 kb upstream of the presumptive transcriptional initiation site. Interestingly, neither the sequence nor location of this element is conserved between teleost and mammalian Col2a1. We generated transient and stable transgenic lines with just the R2 element or the entire 1.7 kb fragment 5' of the transcriptional initiation site. The identified regulatory elements enable the tracking of cellular development in various tissues by driving robust reporter expression in craniofacial cartilage, ear, notochord, floor plate, hypochord and fins in a pattern similar to the expression of endogenous col2a1a. Using a reporter gene driven by the R2 regulatory element, we analyzed the morphogenesis of the notochord sheath cells as they withdraw from the stack of initially uniform cells and encase the inflating vacuolated notochord cells. Finally, we show that like endogenous col2a1a, craniofacial expression of these reporter constructs depends on Sox9a transcription factor activity. At the same time, notochord expression is maintained after Sox9a knockdown, suggesting that other factors can activate expression through the identified regulatory element in this tissue."

In Bowes melanoma cells, the PLAT promoter and the MHRE were fully unmethylated and t-PA secretion was extremely high.

Methylated CpGs may attract co-repressor complexes that contain histone deacetylases (HDAC). However, reporter gene activity of methylated plasmids was not restored by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin. In conclusion, efficient PLAT gene expression requires a short stretch of unmethylated CpG sites in the proximal promoter."

Thus far, the extent to which genital and limb transcriptional networks also share cis-regulatory elements has remained unexplored. We show that many limb enhancers are retained in snake genomes, suggesting that these elements may function in non-limb tissues. Consistent with this, our analysis of cis-regulatory activity in mice and Anolis lizards reveals that patterns of enhancer activity in embryonic limbs and genitalia overlap heavily. In mice, deletion of HLEB, an enhancer of Tbx4, produces defects in hindlimbs and genitalia, establishing the importance of this limb-genital enhancer for development of these different appendages. Further analyses demonstrate that the HLEB of snakes has lost hindlimb enhancer function while retaining genital activity. Our findings identify roles for Tbx4 in genital development and highlight deep similarities in cis-regulatory activity between limbs and genitalia. "

The C-to-T substitution concomitantly increases hnRNPA1 and weakens Tra2β-binding sites, leading to pathological E11 skipping. In hybrid minigenes, exon-specific U1 small nuclear RNAs (ExSpe U1s) that target by complementarity intronic sequences downstream of the donor splice site rescued the E11 skipping defect caused by the c.891C>T mutation. ExSpe U1 lentiviral-mediated transduction of primary NS keratinocytes from a patient bearing the mutation recovered the correct full-length SPINK5 mRNA and the corresponding functional lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor protein in a dose-dependent manner. This study documents the reliability of a mutation-specific, ExSpe U1-based, splicing therapy for a relatively large subset of European NS patients.

We present SeqGL, a novel de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify multiple TF sequence signals from ChIP-, DNase-, and ATAC-seq profiles. SeqGL trains a discriminative model using a k-mer feature representation together with group lasso regularization to extract a collection of sequence signals that distinguish peak sequences from flanking regions. Benchmarked on over 100 ChIP-seq experiments, SeqGL outperformed traditional motif discovery tools in discriminative accuracy. Furthermore, SeqGL can be naturally used with multitask learning to identify genomic and cell-type context determinants of TF binding. SeqGL successfully scales to the large multiplicity of sequence signals in DNase- or ATAC-seq maps. In particular, SeqGL was able to identify a number of ChIP-seq validated sequence signals that were not found by traditional motif discovery algorithms. Thus compared to widely used motif discovery algorithms, SeqGL demonstrates both greater discriminative accuracy and higher sensitivity for detecting the DNA sequence signals underlying regulatory element maps.

This effect can be corrected by diets with similar glycemic loads, but low rates of carbohydrate digestion. However, the effects of these diets on metabolic programming in the livers of offspring, and the liver metabolism contributions to adipogenesis, remain to be addressed. In this study, pregnant insulin-resistant rats were fed high-fat diets with similar glycemic loads but different rates of carbohydrate digestion, High Fat-Rapid Digestive (HF-RD) diet or High Fat-Slow Digestive (HF-SD) diet. Offspring were fed a standard diet for 10 weeks, and the impact of these diets on the metabolic and signaling pathways involved in liver fat synthesis and storage of offspring were analyzed, including liver lipidomics, glycogen and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism key enzymes and signaling pathways. Livers from animals whose mothers were fed an HF-RD diet showed higher saturated triacylglycerol deposits with lower carbon numbers and double bond contents compared with the HF-SD group. Moreover, the HF-RD group exhibited enhanced glucose transporter 2, pyruvate kinase (PK), acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid (FA) synthase expression, and a decrease in pyruvate carboxylase (PyC) expression leading to an altered liver lipid profile. These parameters were normalized in the HF-SD group. The changes in lipogenic enzyme expression were parallel to changes in AktPKB phosphorylation status and nuclear expression in carbohydrate-response element and sterol regulatory element binding proteins. In conclusion, an HF-RD diet during pregnancy translates to changes in liver signaling and metabolic pathways in offspring, enhancing liver lipid storage and synthesis, and therefore non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk. These changes can be corrected by feeding an HF-SD diet during pregnancy."

More recently, replication of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5)/AAV serotype 2 (AAV-2) hybrid vectors was shown to be inhibited incisby a sequence near the 3' end of AAVrep, termed the Rep inhibition sequence for adenoviral replication (RIS-Ad). RIS-Ad functions independently of Rep protein expression. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of adenoviral replication by RIS-Ad requires an active AAV p40 promoter and the 5' half of the intron. In addition, Ad inhibition is critically dependent on the integrity of the p40 transcription start site (TSS) leading to short p40-associated transcripts. These do not give rise to effector molecules capable of inhibiting adenoviral replication intrans, like small polypeptides or microRNAs. Our data point to an inhibitory mechanism in which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses directly downstream of the p40 promoter, leading to interference of the stalled Pol II transcription complex with the adenoviral replication machinery. Whereas inhibition by RIS-Ad is mediated exclusively incis, it can be overcome by providing a replication-competent adenoviral genome intrans Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RIS-Ad is not limited to AAV-2 but could also be shown for the corresponding regions of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-5.

The LXRs are nuclear receptors that increase cholesterol efflux by inducing transcription of their target genes. Transcription of LDLR is regulated by sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) prevents luteolysis and stimulates progesterone synthesis via protein kinase A (PKA). Thus, our primary objectives are: 1) Determine the effects of LXR activation and SREBP inhibition on progesterone secretion and cholesterol metabolism, and 2) Determine whether hCG signaling via PKA regulates transcription of LXR and SREBP target genes in human luteinized granulosa cells. Basal and hCG-stimulated progesterone secretion was significantly decreased by the combined actions of the LXR agonist T0901317 and the SREBP inhibitor fatostatin, which was associated with reduced intracellular cholesterol storage. Expression of LXR target genes in the presence of T0901317 was significantly reduced by hCG, while hCG promoted transcriptional changes that favor LDL uptake. These effects of hCG were reversed by a specific PKA inhibitor. A third objective was to resolve a dilemma concerning LXR regulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) expression in primate and non-primate steroidogenic cells. T0901317 induced STAR expression and progesterone synthesis in ovine, but not human cells, revealing a key difference between species in LXR regulation of luteal function. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that LXR-induced cholesterol efflux and reduced LDL uptake via SREBP inhibition mediates luteolysis in primates, which is prevented by hCG."

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that transcription of a further gene essential for TH synthesis, the thyroglobulin (TG) gene, is under the control of SREBP. To test this hypothesis, we studied the influence of inhibition of SREBP maturation and SREBP knockdown on TG expression in FRTL-5 thyrocytes and explored transcriptional regulation of the TG promoter by reporter gene experiments in FRTL-5 and HepG2 cells, gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Inhibition of SREBP maturation by 25-hydroxycholesterol and siRNA-mediated knockdown of either SREBP-1c or SREBP-2 decreased mRNA and protein levels of TG in FRTL-5 thyrocytes. Reporter gene assays with wild-type and mutated TG promoter reporter truncation constructs revealed that the rat TG promoter is transcriptionally activated by nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2. DNA-binding assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2 bind to a SREBP binding motif with characteristics of an E-box SRE at position -63 in the rat TG promoter. In connection with recent findings that NIS and TPO are regulated by SREBP in thyrocytes the present findings support the view that SREBP are regulators of essential steps of TH synthesis in the thyroid gland such as iodide uptake, iodide oxidation and iodination of tyrosyl residues of TG. This moreover suggests that SREBP may be molecular targets for pharmacological modulation of TH synthesis."

Decreased cortisol sensitivity in the guinea pig is attributed to changes within the helix 1 to helix 3 (H1-H3) loop of the guinea pig GR (gpGR) ligand-binding domain. It has been proposed that this loop serves as a contact point for FKBP52 and/or FKBP51 with receptor. We examined the role of the H1-H3 loop in GR activation by FKBP52 using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. The activity of rat GR (rGR) containing the gpGR H1-H3 loop substitutions was still potentiated by FKBP52, confirming the loop is not involved in primary FKBP52 interactions. Additional assays also excluded a role for other intervening loops between ligand-binding domain helices in direct interactions with FKBP52 associated with enhanced receptor activity. Complementary studies in FKBP51-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and HEK293 cells demonstrated that substitution of the gpGR H1-H3 loop residues into rGR dramatically increased receptor repression by FKBP51 without enhancing receptor-FKBP51 interaction and did not alter recruitment of endogenous Hsp90 and the p23 cochaperone to receptor complexes. FKBP51 suppression of the mutated rGR did not require FKBP51 peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and was not disrupted by mutation of the FK1 proline-rich loop thought to mediate reciprocal FKBP influences on receptor activity. We conclude that the gpGR-specific mutations within the H1-H3 loop confer global changes within the GR-Hsp90 complex that favor FKBP51 repression over FKBP52 potentiation, thus identifying the loop as an important target for GR regulation by the FKBP cochaperones.

We constructed a series of luciferase-encoding chimeric PIV2/5 mini-genomes that are basically hPIV2, but whose leader (le), mRNA start signal and trailer sequence are partially replaced with those of PIV5. Studies of the chimeric PIV2/5 mini-replicons demonstrated that replacement of hPIV2 le with PIV5 le results in remarkably weak luciferase expression. Further mutagenesis identified the responsible region as positions 25-30 of the PIV5 le. Using recombinant hPIV2, the impact of this region on viral life cycles was assessed. Insertion of the mutation at this region facilitated viral growth, genomic replication and mRNA transcription at the early stage of infection, which elicited severe cell damage. In contrast, at the late infection stage it caused a reduction in viral transcription. Here, we identify a novel cis-acting element in the internal region of an le sequence that is involved in the regulation of polymerase, and which contributes to maintaining a balance between viral growth and cytotoxicity."

This binding induced an array of histone modifications associated with gene transcription while a heterochromatic state existed at atmospheric O2. Interestingly, an enhanced euchromatic state was found when hESCs were exposed to hypoxia followed by 72 hours reoxygenation. This was sustained by HIF-2α which enhanced stemness by binding to an oct-sox cis-regulatory element in the NANOG promoter. Thus, these data have uncovered a novel role of HIF-2α as a direct regulator of key transcription factors controlling self-renewal in hESCs but also in the induction of epigenetic modifications ensuring a euchromatic conformation which enhances the regenerative potential of these cells.

Fluorescence titration experiments and UV-monitored melting curves revealed that guanidinylation has a positive effect both on the binding affinity and specificity of the ligands for the stem-loop RNA, as well as on the stabilization of all RNA sequences evaluated, particularly some mutated sequences associated with the development of FTDP-17 tauopathy. However, this correlation between binding affinity and stabilization due to guanidinylation was only found in ligands containing a longer spacer between the acridine and guanidinoneamine moieties, since a shorter spacer produced the opposite effect (e.g. lower binding affinity and lower stabilization).

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the NIS gene is regulated also by SREBP in mammary epithelial cells, in which NIS is functionally expressed during lactation. Regulation of NIS expression and iodide uptake was investigated by means of inhibition, silencing, and overexpression of SREBP and by reporter gene and DNA-binding assays. As a mammary epithelial cell model, the human MCF-7 cell line, a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, which shows inducible expression of NIS by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and unlike bovine mammary epithelial cells, is widely used to investigate the regulation of mammary gland NIS and NIS-specific iodide uptake, was used. Inhibition of SREBP maturation by treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol (5 µM) for 48h reduced ATRA (1 µM)-induced mRNA concentration of NIS and iodide uptake in MCF-7 cells by approximately 20%. Knockdown of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 by RNA interference decreased the mRNA and protein concentration of NIS by 30 to 50% 48h after initiating knockdown, whereas overexpression of nuclear SREBP (nSREBP)-1c and nSREBP-2 increased the expression of NIS in MCF-7 cells by 45 to 60%, respectively, 48h after initiating overexpression. Reporter gene experiments with varying length of NIS promoter reporter constructs revealed that the NIS 5'-flanking region is activated by nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2 approximately 1.5- and 4.5-fold, respectively, and activation involves a SREBP-binding motif (SRE) at -38 relative to the transcription start site of the NIS gene. Gel shift assays using oligonucleotides spanning either the wild-type or the mutated SRE at -38 of the NIS 5'-flanking region showed that in vitro-translated nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2 bind only the wild-type but not the mutated SRE at -38 of NIS. Collectively, the present results from cell culture experiments with human mammary epithelial MCF-7 cells and from genetic studies show for the first time that the NIS gene and iodide uptake are regulated by SREBP in cultured human mammary epithelial cells. Future studies are necessary to clarify if the regulation of NIS expression and iodide uptake by SREBP also applies to the lactating bovine mammary epithelium."

The majority of these ECRs are marked with two histone modifications, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, suggesting potential roles as distant regulatory elements for the transcription of the nearby imprinted genes. In the current study, the chromatin conformation capture (3C) method was utilized to detect potential interactions of these ECRs with the imprinted genes. According to the results, one region, ECR18, located 200-kb upstream of Peg3 interacts with the two promoter regions of Peg3 and Zim2. The observed interaction is most prominent in brain, but was also detected in testis. Histone modification and DNA methylation on ECR18 show no allele bias, implying that this region is likely functional on both alleles. In vitro assays also reveal ECR18 as a potential enhancer or repressor for the promoter of Peg3. Overall, these results indicate that the promoters of several imprinted genes in the Peg3 domain interact with one evolutionarily conserved region, ECR18, and further suggest that ECR18 may play key roles in the transcription and imprinting control of the Peg3 domain as a distant regulatory element.

However, the variable expression of direct RFX-target genes in various sets of ciliated sensory neurons (CSNs) occurs through as of yet uncharacterized mechanisms. In this study the cis-regulatory regions of 41 direct RFX-target genes are compared using in vivo genetic analyses and computational comparisons of orthologous nematode sequences. We find that neither the proximity to the translational start site nor the exact sequence composition of the X-box promoter motif of the respective ciliary gene can explain the variation in expression patterns observed among different direct RFX-target genes. Instead, a novel enhancer element appears to co-regulate ciliary genes in a DAF-19 dependent manner. This cytosine- and thymidine-rich sequence, the C-box, was found in the cis-regulatory regions in close proximity to the respective X-box motif for 84% of the most broadly expressed direct RFX-target genes sampled in this study. Molecular characterization confirmed that these 8-11 bp C-box sequences act as strong enhancer elements for direct RFX-target genes. An artificial promoter containing only an X-box promoter motif and two of the C-box enhancer elements was able to drive strong expression of a GFP reporter construct in many C. elegans CSNs. These data provide a much-improved understanding of how direct RFX-target genes are differentially regulated in C. elegans and will provide a molecular model for uncovering the transcriptional network mediating ciliary gene expression in animals."

Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA that alter gene expression have been hypothesized as a key driver of these phenotypic differences. This has been supported by differential gene expression analyses in general, but not by the identification of specific regulatory elements responsible for changes in transcription and phenotype. To identify the genetic source of regulatory differences, we mapped DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites, which mark all types of active gene regulatory elements, genome-wide in the same cell type isolated from human, chimpanzee, and macaque. Most DHS sites were conserved among all three species, as expected based on their central role in regulating transcription. However, we found evidence that several hundred DHS sites were gained or lost on the lineages leading to modern human and chimpanzee. Species-specific DHS site gains are enriched near differentially expressed genes, are positively correlated with increased transcription, show evidence of branch-specific positive selection, and overlap with active chromatin marks. Species-specific sequence differences in transcription factor motifs found within these DHS sites are linked with species-specific changes in chromatin accessibility. Together, these indicate that the regulatory elements identified here are genetic contributors to transcriptional and phenotypic differences among primate species."

Because of the clear association between HMGB1 and cancer, we studied the binding of adriamycin (ADM), a well-known anticancer drug with the promoter region (-165 to -183) of hmgb1 by using a variety of spectroscopic, calorimetric techniques, and in-silico molecular modeling. Changes in UV and CD spectral characteristics (intensity and wavelength) of ADM and DNA associated with an induced peak (300 nm) in CD spectrum of DNA and a high binding constant of 2.0 × 10(5) M(-1) suggest a strong and stable complex formation between DNA and ADM. Scatchard analysis of spectroscopic data indicate that ADM binds to DNA in a non-cooperative nature. Further the quenching of fluorescence emission of ADM and isothermal titration calorimetry of ADM in presence of DNA points out to the intercalative mode of ADM binding to DNA which is enthalpically driven with additional small entropic contribution. Results from molecular modeling, Isothermal titration calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal that ADM has no marked preference between AT vs. GC base pair in binding to DNA. Therefore, hmgb1 can be considered as a novel potential chemotherapeutic target in treating cancers associated with HMGB1 upregulation. "

However, the molecular details of how FIRE activity is regulated and how it impacts the Csf1r promoter have not been characterised. Here we show that agents that down-modulate Csf1r mRNA transcription regulated promoter activity altered the occupancy of key FIRE cis-acting elements including RUNX1, AP1, and Sp1 binding sites. We demonstrate that FIRE acts as an anti-sense promoter in macrophages and reversal of FIRE orientation within its native context greatly reduced enhancer activity in macrophages. Mutation of transcription initiation sites within FIRE also reduced transcription. These results demonstrate that FIRE is an orientation-specific transcribed enhancer element."

In this study, we used a well-investigated alternative splicing reporter to dissect splicing regulatory elements residing in the post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE) of HBV. A strong intronic splicing silencer (ISS) with a minimal functional element of 105 nucleotides (referred to as PRE-ISS) was identified and, interestingly, both the sense and antisense strands of the element were found to strongly suppress alternative splicing in multiple human cell lines. PRE-ISS folds into a double-hairpin structure, in which substitution mutations disrupting the double-hairpin structure abolish the splicing silencer activity. Although it harbors two previously identified binding sites for polypyrimidine tract binding protein, PRE-ISS represses splicing independent of this protein. The silencing function of PRE-ISS exhibited a strong position dependence, decreasing with the distance from affected splice sites. PRE-ISS does not belong to the intronic region of any HBV splicing variants identified thus far, preventing the testing of this intronic silencer function in the regulation of HBV splicing. These findings, together with the identification of multiple sense-antisense ISSs in the HBV genome, support the hypothesis that a sequence-independent and structure-dependent regulatory mechanism may have evolved to repress cryptic splice sites in HBV transcripts, thereby preventing their aberrant splicing during viral replication in the host."

Although the regulatory effects of SREBP-1 on lipid and milk fat synthesis have received much attention in ruminants, SREBP-1c promoter and its regulatory mechanisms have not been characterized in the goat. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced a 2,012-bp fragment of the SREBP-1c 5'-flanking region from goat genomic DNA.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutation analysis, we identified a new SRE motif, 60% identical to an inverted SRE-3, able to bind SREBP-2 in vitro and in vivo. Co-transfection of promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in HepG2 cells showed that the binding of SREBP-2 to SRE produced approximately 26-fold promoter activation, whereas mutation of the SRE motif caused a dramatic decrease of transactivation by SREBP-2. The function of additional motifs that bind transcription factors cooperating with SREBP-2 was investigated. An inverted CCAAT-box, that binds nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), cooperates with SREBP-2 in TM7SF2 promoter activation. Deletion of this motif resulted in the loss of promoter induction by sterol starvation in HepG2 cells, as well as a decrease in fold activation by SREBP-2 in co-transfection experiments. Moreover, co-transfection of the promoter with a plasmid expressing dominant negative NF-YA did not permit full activation by SREBP-2. Three GC-boxes (1, 2, 3), known to bind Sp1 transcription factor, were also investigated. The mutagenesis of each of them produced a decrease in SREBP-2-dependent activation, the most powerful being GC-box2. A triple mutagenized promoter construct did not have an additive effect. We conclude that, besides the SRE motif, both the inverted CCAAT-box and GC-box2 are essential for full promoter activation by SREBP-2."

PTE function can be replaced by heterologous RNA export elements, e.g. CTE of simian type D retroviruses. Alternatively, Gag particle production is achieved using an RNA/codon optimized gag gene. PTE function is transferable and can replace HIV Rev-RRE-regulated expression of HIV gag. Analysis of PTE by SHAPE revealed a highly structured RNA comprising seven stem-loop structures, with the 5' and 3' stem-loops forming an essential bipartite signal. MuLV and XMRV PTE share 98% identity and have highly similar RNA structures, with changes mostly located to single-stranded regions. PTE identification strongly suggests that all retroviruses and retroelements share common strategies of post-transcriptional gene regulation to produce Gag. Expression depends on complex RNA structures embedded within retroviral mRNA, in coding regions or the 3' untranslated region. These specific structures serve as recognition signals for either cellular or viral proteins. "

However, we lack a comprehensive tissue- and genome-wide understanding of how and when TEs gain regulatory activity in their hosts. We evaluated the prevalence of TE-derived DNA in enhancers and promoters across hundreds of human and mouse cell lines and primary tissues. Promoters are significantly depleted of TEs in all tissues compared with their overall prevalence in the genome (P < 0.001); enhancers are also depleted of TEs, though not as strongly as promoters. The degree of enhancer depletion also varies across contexts (1.5-3×), with reproductive and immune cells showing the highest levels of TE regulatory activity in humans. Overall, in spite of the regulatory potential of many TE sequences, they are significantly less active in gene regulation than expected from their prevalence. TE age is predictive of the likelihood of enhancer activity; TEs originating before the divergence of amniotes are 9.2 times more likely to have enhancer activity than TEs that integrated in great apes. Context-specific enhancers are more likely to be TE-derived than enhancers active in multiple tissues, and young TEs are more likely to overlap context-specific enhancers than old TEs (86% vs. 47%). Once TEs obtain enhancer activity in the host, they have similar functional dynamics to one another and non-TE-derived enhancers, likely driven by pleiotropic constraints. However, a few TE families, most notably endogenous retroviruses, have greater regulatory potential. Our observations suggest a model of regulatory co-option in which TE-derived sequences are initially repressed, after which a small fraction obtains context-specific enhancer activity, with further gains subject to pleiotropic constraints."

Interestingly, Mmp2(-/-) mice expressed greater amounts of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (a target of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2-mediated transcription and rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol and isoprenoids biosynthesis) in addition to markers of inflammation including chemokines of the C-C motif ligand family. We focused on the functionally related genes for sterol regulatory binding protein-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, attenuated angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in Mmp2(-/-) and wild-type (Mmp2(+/+)) mice, with Mmp2(-/-) mice showing resistance to cardioprotection by lovastatin. MMP-2 deficiency predisposes to cardiac dysfunction as well as metabolic and inflammatory gene expression dysregulation. This complex phenotype is, at least in part, because of the cardiac sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway being upregulated in MMP-2 deficiency.

However, the inclusion of WPRE and cPPT in a lentiviral construct may pose safety risks when administered to human. A simple lentiviral construct driven by an alternative promoter with proven extended duration of gene expression without the two regulatory elements would be free from the risks. In a non-viral gene delivery context, gene expression driven by human polybiquitin C (UbC) promoter resulted in higher and more persistent expression in mouse as compared to cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. In this study, we measured the efficiency and persistency of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene expression in cells transduced with LV driven by UbC (LV/UbC/GFP) devoid of the WPRE and cPPT in comparison to the established LV construct encoding WPRE and cPPT, driven by CMV promoter (LV/CMV/GFP). However, we found that LV/UbC/GFP was inferior to LV/CMV/GFP in many aspects: (i) the titer of virus produced; (ii) the levels of reporter gene expression when MOI value was standardized; and (iii) the transduction efficiency in different cell types. The duration of reporter gene expression in selected cell lines was also determined. While the GFP expression in cells transduced with LV/CMV/GFP persisted throughout the experimental period of 14 days, expression in cells transduced with LV/UbC/GFP declined by day 2 post-transduction. In summary, the LV driven by the UbC promoter without the WPRE and cPPT does not exhibit enhanced or durable transgene expression."

However, little is known about the cis-elements and trans-acting proteins involved in regulating AS. Using a splicing reporter (GFP-intron-GFP), consisting of the GFP coding sequence interrupted by an alternatively spliced intron of SCL33, we investigated whether cis-elements within this intron are sufficient for AS, and which SR proteins are necessary for regulated AS. Expression of the splicing reporter in protoplasts faithfully produced all splice variants from the intron, suggesting that cis-elements required for AS reside within the intron. To determine which SR proteins are responsible for AS, the splicing pattern of the GFP-intron-GFP reporter was investigated in protoplasts of three single and three double mutants of SR genes. These analyses revealed that SCL33 and a closely related paralog, SCL30a, are functionally redundant in generating specific splice variants from this intron. Furthermore, SCL33 protein bound to a conserved sequence in this intron, indicating auto-regulation of AS. Mutations in four GAAG repeats within the conserved region impaired generation of the same splice variants that are affected in the scl33 scl30a double mutant. In conclusion, we have identified the first intronic cis-element involved in AS of a plant SR gene, and elucidated a mechanism for auto-regulation of AS of this intron. "

The accumulation of lipid droplets in infected hepatocytes manifests as hepatosteatosis, a common pathology observed in chronic hepatitis C patients. One way by which HCV promotes the accumulation of intracellular lipids is through enhancing de novo lipogenesis by activating the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). In general, activation of SREBPs occurs during cholesterol depletion. Interestingly, during HCV infection, the activation of SREBPs occurs under normal cholesterol levels, but the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Our previous study has demonstrated the activation of the inflammasome complex in HCV-infected human hepatoma cells. In this study, we elucidate the potential link between chronic hepatitis C-associated inflammation and alteration of lipid homeostasis in infected cells. Our results reveal that the HCV-activated NLRP3 inflammasome is required for the up-regulation of lipogenic genes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA against the inflammasome components (NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, and caspase-1), we further show that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in lipid droplet formation. NLRP3 inflammasome activation in HCV-infected cells enables caspase-1-mediated degradation of insulin-induced gene proteins. This subsequently leads to the transport of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein·SREBP complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, followed by proteolytic activation of SREBPs by S1P and S2P in the Golgi. Typically, inflammasome activation leads to viral clearance. Paradoxically, here we demonstrate how HCV exploits the NLRP3 inflammasome to activate SREBPs and host lipid metabolism, leading to liver disease pathogenesis associated with chronic HCV. "

We used CRE-seq to assay >1,000 single and double nucleotide mutations in a 52-bp CRE in the Rhodopsin promoter that drives strong and specific expression in mammalian photoreceptors. We find that this particular CRE is remarkably complex. The majority (86%) of single nucleotide substitutions in this sequence exert significant effects on regulatory activity. Although changes in the affinity of known TF binding sites explain some of these expression changes, we present evidence for complex phenomena, including binding site turnover and TF competition. Analysis of double mutants revealed complex, nucleotide-specific interactions between residues in different TF binding sites. We conclude that some mammalian CREs are finely tuned by evolution and function through complex, nonadditive interactions between bound TFs. CRE-seq will be an important tool to uncover the rules that govern these interactions."

Results showed that BPA altered lipid content by regulating some metabolism-related genes. The BPA's inhibiting effect on fatty acid β-oxidation might be stronger than on lipid synthesis. BPA disturbed the expression of acaca (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), fasn (fatty acid synthase) and cpt1α (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α) by altering the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) binding to their sterol regulatory elements (SREs). Our result also revealed that DNA methylation in the 5' flanking regions of cpt1α could perturb the SREBP-1 binding adjacent to its SRE in females under BPA exposure. Besides, BPA exposure led to gender-specific effect on fatty acid β-oxidation in G. rarus. This will contribute to our understanding of the regulation mechanisms of BPA on lipid metabolism in fish."

However, molecular mechanisms underlying CR-associated metabolic remodeling of WAT remain unclear. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (Srebp-1c), a master transcription factor of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, is responsible for the pathogenesis of fatty liver (steatosis).

However, via Srebp-1c, most of these CR-associated metabolic alterations were not observed in other tissues, including the liver. Moreover, our data indicated that Srebp-1c may be an important factor both for CR-associated suppression of oxidative stress, through increased synthesis of glutathione in WAT, and for the prolongevity action of CR. Our results strongly suggested that Srebp-1c, the primary FA biosynthesis-promoting transcriptional factor implicated in fatty liver disease, is also the food shortage-responsive factor in WAT. This indicated that Srebp-1c is a key regulator of metabolic remodeling leading to the beneficial effects of CR."

Apigenin, a common plant food flavonoid, was shown to modulate the nuclear translocation of SREBP-2 in the hepatic cells WRL-68 in the present study. The processing of SREBP-2 protein occurred after translation, and apigenin blocked this activation route. Further examination indicated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by the flavone, and co-administrating the AMPK-specific inhibitor compound C could release the blockage. Reporter gene assay revealed that the transactivation of sterol responsive element (SRE)-containing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) promoter was suppressed by the flavone. Similarly, electromobility shift assay result also demonstrated a reduced DNA-binding activity on the SRE domain under the same treatment. The reduced transactivity and DNA-binding activity could be attributed to a decreased amount of SREBP-2 translocating from cytosol to nucleus as depicted by confocal microscopy. Quantitative RT-PCR assay demonstrated that the transcription of HMGCR followed the same pattern of SREBP-2 translocation. In summary, the present study showed that apigenin prevented SREBP-2 translocation and reduced the downstream gene HMGCR transcription. The minimum effective dosage should be achievable in the form of functional food consumption or dietary supplementation. "

The objectives were to investigate whether SREBP-2 regulates LRP1 transcription and determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the process. Down-regulation of active SREBP-2 by nLDL and agLDL led to LDLR down-regulation and LRP1 up-regulation. Enforced expression of an active form of SREBP-2 (SREBP-2-NT, amino acid residues 1-468) decreased LRP1 expression and LRP1 promoter (WT-LRP1) luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. LDL did not exert any significant effect on LRP1 promoter activity when a putative sterol regulatory element (SRE) (5-GTGGGGTGA-3'; +225 to +233) was mutated (SRE-MT-LRP1). SREBP-2 overexpression exerted stronger down-regulatory effects on WT-LRP1 than on SRE-MT-LRP1 promoter activity both in control, nLDL- and agLDL-exposed HeLa cells. Gel mobility shift assays showed that recombinant SREBP-2-NT protein (1-468) binds to a double-stranded LRP1 DNA fragment (215 to 245) containing a wild-type (wt) SRE sequence but not to a mutated SRE (mt) sequence (5-GAATTCGA-3').

We investigated the effect of insulin on hepatic clusterin expression and its underlying mechanisms. Insulin increased the mRNA and protein levels of clusterin in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines. Serial deletion and mutant analysis of the clusterin promoter demonstrated that insulin-stimulated transactivation is mediated via a non-canonical E-box (NCE-box) motif in the proximal upstream region. Interestingly, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) co-transfection showed the same transactivation pattern as insulin stimulation in serial deletion and mutant promoter analysis. In contrast, co-transfection with a dominant negative form of SREBP-1c inhibited insulin-stimulated clusterin expression. Furthermore, insulin increased the recruitment of SREBP-1c to the NCE-box of the clusterin promoter region. Taken together, our results suggest that an NCE-box within the clusterin promoter is necessary for insulin-stimulated hepatic expression of clusterin via SREBP-1c. "

The distal promoter displays little if any conservation between several closely related nematodes. Despite this divergence, sequences from all species confer robustness of expression, arguing that this function does not require substantial sequence conservation. We showed that even unrelated sequences have the ability to promote robust expression. A prominent feature shared by all of these robustness-promoting sequences is an AT-enriched nucleotide composition consistent with nucleosome depletion. Because general sequence composition can be maintained despite sequence turnover, our results explain how different functional constraints can lead to vastly disparate rates of sequence divergence within a promoter."

Compared with Ad-GFP cells (control), Ad-nSREBP1 cells had a significant increase in expression of genes related to long-chain fatty acid activation (ACSL1), transport (FABP3), desaturation (SCD1), de novo synthesis of fatty acids (ACSS2, ACLY, IDH1, ACACA, FASN, and ELOVL6), and transcriptional factors (NR1H3 and PPARG). We observed a >10-fold increase in expression of INSIG1 but SCAP was downregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Among genes related to milk fat synthesis and lipid droplet formation, only LPIN1 and DGAT1 were upregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with the Ad-GFP, the cellular triacylglycerol content was higher and the percentage of C16:0 and C18:1 increased, whereas that of C16:1, C18:0, and C18:2 decreased in Ad-nSREBP1 cells. Overall, the data provide strong support for a central role of SREBP1 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis in goat mammary cells. "

About 13% of CFTR mutations are classified as ""splicing mutations,"" but for almost 40% of these, their role in affecting the pre-mRNA splicing of the gene is not yet defined. In this work, we describe a new splicing mutation detected in three unrelated Italian CF patients. By DNA analyses and mRNA studies, we identified the c.1002-1110_1113delTAAG mutation localized in intron 6b of the CFTR gene. At the mRNA level, this mutation creates an aberrant inclusion of a sequence of 101 nucleotides between exons 6b and 7. This sequence corresponds to a portion of intron 6b and resembles a cryptic exon because it is characterized by an upstream ag and a downstream gt sequence, which are most probably recognized as 5'- and 3'-splice sites by the spliceosome. Through functional analysis of this splicing defect, we show that this mutation abolishes the interaction of the splicing regulatory protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 with an intronic splicing regulatory element and creates a new recognition motif for the SRp75 splicing factor, causing activation of the cryptic exon. Our results show that the c.1002-1110_1113delTAAG mutation creates a new intronic splicing regulatory element in intron 6b of the CFTR gene exclusively recognized by SRp75."

For the first time, the levels of these molecules were assessed here in sterol regulatory element binding protein -1c knock-out male mice (i.e., an experimental model of peripheral neuropathy) and compared with observations in wild type animals. The levels of neuroactive steroids have been evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and sciatic nerve at 2 and 10 months of age and these analyses were implemented analyzing the gene expression of crucial steroidogenic enzymes in sciatic nerve. Data obtained at 2 months of age showed high levels of pregnenolone in sciatic nerve, associated with low levels of its first metabolite, progesterone, and further metabolites (i.e., 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one). High levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol were also observed. At 10 months of age, the neuroactive steroid profile showed some differences. Indeed, low levels of pregnenolone and high levels of 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one were observed. The analysis of the gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes considered here generally followed these changes. Interestingly, the levels of pregnenolone and progesterone were unmodified in plasma suggesting a specific effect of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c on neurosteroidogenesis. Because this peripheral neuropathy is due to altered fatty acid biosynthesis, data reported here support the belief that the cross-talk between this biosynthetic pathway and neuroactive steroids may represent a possible therapeutic strategy for peripheral neuropathy."

In this report we identify a regulatory region of the Tctex-1 gene that is capable of directing transgenic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter that recapitulates the spatial and temporal expression pattern of endogenous Tctex-1. This construct specifically targeted expression to the nestin(+)/Pax6(+)/GLAST(+) radial glial cells and Tbr2(+) intermediate progenitors when the reporter construct was delivered to developing mouse neocortex via in utero electroporation. Characterization of mice transgenically expressing GFP under the same regulatory element showed that the GFP expression is faithful to endogenous Tctex-1 at the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus, ventricular/subventricular zone of lateral ventricles, and ependymal layer of 3rd ventricle of adult brains. Immunolocalization and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation studies of adult SGZ in four independent mouse lines showed that Tctex-1:GFP reporter selectively marks nestin(+)/GFAP(+)/Sox2(+) neural stem-like cells in two mouse lines (4 and 13). In two other mouse lines (17 and 18), Tctex-1:GFP is selectively expressed in Type-2 and Type-3 transient amplifying progenitors and a small subset of young neuronal progeny. The P/E-Tctex-1 reporter mouse studies independently confirmed the specific enrichment of Tctex-1 at adult SGZ stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, these studies supported the notion that an analogous transcriptional program may be used to regulate neurogenesis in embryonic cerebral cortex and adult hippocampus. Finally, the genomic sequences and the reporter mouse lines described here provide useful experimental tools to advance adult neural stem cell research."

Using transgenic mice carrying human CD34 PAC constructs, we identified a novel downstream regulatory element (DRE), which is bound by RUNX1 and is necessary for human CD34 expression in long-term (LT)-HSCs. Conditional deletion of Runx1 in mice harbouring human CD34 promoter-DRE constructs abrogates human CD34 expression. We demonstrate by chromosome conformation capture assays in LT-HSCs that the DRE physically interacts with the human CD34 promoter. Targeted mutagenesis of RUNX binding sites leads to perturbation of this interaction and decreased human CD34 expression in LT-HSCs. Overall, our in vivo data provide novel evidence about the role of RUNX1 in mediating interactions between distal and proximal elements of the HSC gene CD34."

We have identified a NAC gene, TAPNAC (At1g61110), specifically expressed in the Arabidopsis tapetum via transcriptional profiling. The TAPNAC promoter was studied in detail to identify cis regulatory sequences that confer tapetal specific expression. For this purpose, TAPNAC promoter elements were fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and spatial and temporal GUS expression was monitored. The results showed that TAPNAC promoter-driven GUS expression emulates the expression of TAPNAC mRNA in anthers. A conserved TCGTGT motif was identified in the TAPNAC promoter and other tapetal expressed promoters. The TCGTGT motif enhances GUS expression in anthers of transgenic plants but only in the context of the TAPNAC promoter proximal region."

Dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1 or dysbindin) is one of the Research Domain Constructs (RDoC) associated with cognition and is significantly reduced in the brain of schizophrenia patients. To further understand the molecular underpinnings of pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we have performed microarray analyses of the hippocampi from dysbindin knockout mice, and found that genes involved in the lipogenic pathway are suppressed. Moreover, we discovered that maturation of a master transcriptional regulator for lipid synthesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) is induced by neuronal activity, and is required for induction of the immediate early gene ARC (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein), necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory. We found that nuclear SREBP1 is dramatically reduced in dysbindin-1 knockout mice and postmortem brain tissues from human patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, activity-dependent maturation of SREBP1 as well as ARC expression were attenuated in dysbindin-1 knockout mice, and these deficits were restored by an atypical antipsychotic drug, clozapine. Together, results indicate an important role of dysbindin-1 in neuronal activity induced SREBP1 and ARC, which could be related to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."

This study used SREBP-1c knockout (KO) mice to examine whether a deficiency in SREBP-1c would affect their emotional and psychiatric behaviors. Altered mRNA expression in genes downstream from SREBP-1c was confirmed in the brains of SREBP-1c KO mice. Schizophrenia-like behavior, including hyperactivity during the dark phase, depressive-like behavior, aggressive behavior and deficits in social interaction and prepulse inhibition, was observed in SREBP-1c KO mice. Furthermore, increased volume of the lateral ventricle was detected in SREBP-1c KO mice. The mRNA levels of several γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor subtypes and/or glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 decreased in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex of SREBP-1c KO mice. Thus, SREBP-1c deficiency may contribute to enlargement of the lateral ventricle and development of schizophrenia-like behaviors and be associated with altered GABAergic transmission."

Recent studies have identified a loss-of-function allele at the HMX1 locus as the causative mutation in the oculo-auricular syndrome (OAS) in humans, characterized by ear and eye malformations. The mouse dumbo (dmbo) mutation, with similar effects on ear and eye development, also results from a loss-of-function mutation in the Hmx1 gene. A recessive dmbo mutation causing ear malformation in rats has been mapped to the chromosomal region containing the Hmx1 gene, but the nature of the causative allele is unknown. Here we show that dumbo rats and mice exhibit similar neonatal ear and eye phenotypes. In midgestation embryos, dumbo rats show a specific loss of Hmx1 expression in neural-crest-derived craniofacial mesenchyme (CM), whereas Hmx1 is expressed normally in retinal progenitors, sensory ganglia and in CM, which is derived from mesoderm. High-throughput resequencing of 1 Mb of rat chromosome 14 from dmbo/dmbo rats, encompassing the Hmx1 locus, reveals numerous divergences from the rat genomic reference sequence, but no coding changes in Hmx1. Fine genetic mapping narrows the dmbo critical region to an interval of ∼410 kb immediately downstream of the Hmx1 transcription unit. Further sequence analysis of this region reveals a 5777-bp deletion located ∼80 kb downstream in dmbo/dmbo rats that is not apparent in 137 other rat strains. The dmbo deletion region contains a highly conserved domain of ∼500 bp, which is a candidate distal enhancer and which exhibits a similar relationship to Hmx genes in all vertebrate species for which data are available. We conclude that the rat dumbo phenotype is likely to result from loss of function of an ultraconserved enhancer specifically regulating Hmx1 expression in neural-crest-derived CM. Dysregulation of Hmx1 expression is thus a candidate mechanism for congenital ear malformation, most cases of which remain unexplained."

The polypyrimidine/polypurine (PPy/u) motif enhances the activity of the MOR gene promoter by adopting a non-B DNA conformation. Here, we report that the PPy/u motif regulates the processivity of torsional stress, which is important for endogenous MOR gene expression. Analysis by topoisomerase assays, S1 nuclease digests, and atomic force microscopy showed that, unlike homologous PPy/u motifs, the position- and orientation-induced structural strains to the mouse PPy/u element affect its ability to perturb the relaxation activity of topoisomerase, resulting in polypurine strand-nicked and catenated DNA conformations. Raman spectrum microscopy confirmed that mouse PPy/u containing-plasmid DNA molecules under the different structural strains have a different configuration of ring bases as well as altered Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. The mouse MOR PPy/u motif drives reporter gene expression fortyfold more effectively in the sense orientation than in the antisense orientation. Furthermore, mouse neuronal cells activate MOR gene expression in response to the perturbations of topology by topoisomerase inhibitors, whereas human cells do not. These results suggest that, interestingly among homologous PPy/u motifs, the mouse MOR PPy/u motif dynamically responds to torsional stress and consequently regulates MOR gene expression in vivo."

Here, we investigate the effect of mutations observed in the BMR sequence of a conserved non-coding element upstream of Tdrd7, a pleiotropic gene required for lens development and spermatogenesis. We first show that this conserved element is a transcriptional repressor in lens cells and that the BMR sequence partially lost repressor activity. Next, we recapitulated evolutionary changes in this element by precisely replacing the endogenous regulatory element in a mouse line by the orthologous BMR sequence with CRISPR-Cas9. Strikingly, this repressor replacement caused a more than two-fold up-regulation of Tdrd7 in the developing lens; however, increased mRNA level does not result in a corresponding increase in TDRD7 protein nor an obvious lens phenotype, possibly explained by buffering at the posttranscriptional level. Our results are consistent with eye degeneration in subterranean mammals having a polygenic basis where many small-effect mutations in different eye-regulatory elements collectively contribute to phenotypic differences."

We hypothesize that MREs will be found upstream of miRNA genes as well as miRNA target genes in the following bone growth and development signaling pathways: TGF-β, MAPK, and Wnt. A Bioconductor-based workflow in R was designed to identify interactions between MREs, miRNAs, and target genes. MRE sequences were found upstream from 64 mature miRNAs that interact with 213 genes which have MRE sequences in their own promoter regions. MAPK1 exhibited the most miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways; CCND2 exhibited the most interactions in the Wnt signaling pathway. Hsa-miR-124-3p exhibited the most MTIs in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways; hsa-miR-20b-5p exhibited the most MTIs in the Wnt signaling pathway.

The EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is commonly expressed in NPC, engages multiple signaling pathways that promote cell growth, transformation, and metabolic reprogramming. Here, we report a novel function of LMP1 in promoting de novo lipogenesis. LMP1 increases the expression, maturation and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a master regulator of lipogenesis, and its downstream target fatty acid synthase (FASN). LMP1 also induces de novo lipid synthesis and lipid droplet formation. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of LMP1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells diminished SREBP1 activation and lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, through the use of either mTOR inhibitors or siRNAs, significantly reduced LMP1-mediated SREBP1 activity and lipogenesis, indicating that LMP1 activation of the mTOR pathway is required for SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis. In primary NPC tumors, FASN overexpression is common, with high levels correlating significantly with LMP1 expression. Moreover, elevated FASN expression was associated with aggressive disease and poor survival in NPC patients. Luteolin and fatostatin, two inhibitors of lipogenesis, suppressed lipogenesis and proliferation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, effects that were more profound in cells expressing LMP1. Luteolin and fatostatin also dramatically inhibited NPC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that LMP1 activation of SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis promotes tumor cell growth and is involved in EBV-driven NPC pathogenesis. Our results also reveal the therapeutic potential of utilizing lipogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NPC. © 2018 The Authors.

In addition, S. constricta is the first marine mollusc demonstrated to possess Δ6 fatty acyl desaturase (Fad) and complete LC-PUFA biosynthetic ability, providing a good representative to investigate the molecular mechanism of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) in regulating Δ6 Fad for LC-PUFA biosynthesis in marine molluscs. Herein, S. constricta SREBP and Δ6 Fad promoter were cloned and characterised. Subsequently, dual luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted to explore the SREBP binding elements in the core regulatory region of S. constricta Δ6 Fad promoter. Results showed that S. constricta SREBP had a very conservative basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motif, while S. constricta Δ6 Fad promoter exhibited very poor identity with teleost Fads2 promoters, indicating their differentiation during evolution. A 454 bp region harbouring a core sequence in S. constricta Δ6 Fad promoter was predicted to be essential for the transcriptional activation by SREBP. This was the first report on the regulatory mechanism of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in marine molluscs, which would facilitate optimising the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway of bivalves in further studies."

Our previous genome-wide association study of sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis identified associations with variants downstream from BMP2 and intronic in BBS9. Because no coding variants in BMP2 were identified, we hypothesized that conserved non-coding regulatory elements may alter BMP2 expression. In order to identify and characterize noncoding regulatory elements near BMP2, two conserved noncoding regions near the associated region on chromosome 20 were tested for regulatory activity with a Renilla luciferase assay. For a 711 base pair noncoding fragment encompassing the most strongly associated variant, rs1884302, the luciferase assay showed that the risk allele (C) of rs1884302 drives higher expression of the reporter than the common allele (T). When this same DNA fragment was tested in zebrafish transgenesis studies, a strikingly different expression pattern of the green fluorescent reporter was observed depending on whether the transgenic fish had the risk (C) or the common (T) allele at rs1884302. The in vitro results suggest that altered BMP2 regulatory function at rs1884302 may contribute to the etiology of sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.

XN independently suppressed the maturation of SREBPs of insulin-induced genes in a manner different from sterols. Our results suggest that XN impairs the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi translocation of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)-SREBP complex by binding to Sec23/24 and blocking SCAP/SREBP incorporation into common coated protein II vesicles. Furthermore, in diet-induced obese mice, dietary XN suppressed SREBP-1 target gene expression in the liver accompanied by a reduction of the mature form of hepatic SREBP-1, and it inhibited the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis. Altogether, our data suggest that XN attenuates the function of SREBP-1 by repressing its maturation and that it has the potential of becoming a nutraceutical food or pharmacological agent for improving metabolic syndrome.

We and others have shown previously that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) improves functional recovery of the rodent heart during reperfusion. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of hyperinsulinemia in mice down-regulates myocardial UCP3. Decreased UCP3 expression was linked to the development of selective insulin resistance in the heart, characterized by decreased basal activity of Akt but preserved activity of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and overactivation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-mediated lipogenic program. In cultured myocytes, insulin treatment and SREBP-1 overexpression decreased, whereas SREBP-1 interference increased, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-stimulated expression of UCP3. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis identified three functional sterol regulatory elements in the vicinity of a known complex intronic enhancer. Increased binding of SREBP-1 to this DNA region was confirmed in the heart of hyperinsulinemic mice. In conclusion, we describe a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism by which insulin inhibits cardiac UCP3 expression through activation of the lipogenic factor SREBP-1. Sustained down-regulation of cardiac UCP3 by hyperinsulinemia may partly explain the poor prognosis of type 2 diabetic patients after myocardial infarction. "

We systematically identified and characterized these regulatory elements based on publicly available datasets of ChIP-Seq of 97 transcription factors (TFs) provided by ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects. We determined transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) using the ChIP-Seq datasets and identified TFBSs observed on HERV/LTR sequences (HERV-TFBSs). Overall, 794,972 HERV-TFBSs were identified. Subsequently, we identified ""HERV/LTR-shared regulatory element (HSRE),"" defined as a TF-binding motif in HERV-TFBSs, shared within a substantial fraction of a HERV/LTR type. HSREs could be an indication that the regulatory elements of HERV/LTRs are present before their insertions. We identified 2,201 HSREs, comprising specific associations of 354 HERV/LTRs and 84 TFs. Clustering analysis showed that HERV/LTRs can be grouped according to the TF binding patterns; HERV/LTR groups bounded to pluripotent TFs (e.g., SOX2, POU5F1, and NANOG), embryonic endoderm/mesendoderm TFs (e.g., GATA4/6, SOX17, and FOXA1/2), hematopoietic TFs (e.g., SPI1 (PU1), GATA1/2, and TAL1), and CTCF were identified. Regulatory elements of HERV/LTRs tended to locate nearby and/or interact three-dimensionally with the genes involved in immune responses, indicating that the regulatory elements play an important role in controlling the immune regulatory network. Further, we demonstrated subgroup-specific TF binding within LTR7, LTR5B, and LTR5_Hs, indicating that gains or losses of the regulatory elements occurred during genomic invasions of the HERV/LTRs. Finally, we constructed dbHERV-REs, an interactive database of HERV/LTR regulatory elements (http://herv-tfbs.com/).

Comparing cis-regulatory element conservation across six lepidopteran genomes, we find that regulatory sequences evolve at a pace similar to that of protein-coding regions. We also observe that elements active at multiple developmental stages are markedly more conserved than elements with stage-specific activity. Surprisingly, we also find that stage-specific proximal and distal regulatory elements evolve at nearly identical rates. Our study provides a benchmark for genome-wide patterns of regulatory element evolution in insects, and it shows that developmental timing of activity strongly predicts patterns of regulatory sequence evolution."

However, the distribution and evolution of the SREBPs in fungi, especially in the Pezizomycotina which comprised of a great many of animal and plant pathogens, are unexplored. In this study, we identified 641 SREBPs from 367 out of 530 fungi species. Reconstruction of their evolutionary history showed evidence of gene duplication and gene loss at multiple evolutionary scales. Especially, SREBPs undergo a gene duplication event in the common ancestor of Pezizomycotina, resulting in the formation of two clades of SREBPs. Besides, the conserved motifs in the bHLH domain of both clades within Eurotiomycetes are highly diverged. To better understand the evolutionary diversification of this biologically significant regulator, we performed a series of experiments using Penicillium digitatum, a member of the lineage of Eurotiomycetes, to investigate how the evolutionary process of gene duplication shaped its function. qRT-PCR analysis showed that although PdsreA and PdsreB can be induced by imazalil, they showed different expression pattern; the electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PdSreA but not PdSreB can directly bind to the PdMLE1 sequence, an element that leads to the increased resistance to demethylation inhibitors (DMI) fungicides in P. digitatum. These results demonstrated that functions of duplicated SREBPs have largely diverged in P. digitatum, which may be a major feature of the long-term adaptive evolution of a particular group of fungi."

A previous study showed that SREBP‑2 also activated autophagic genes during cell‑sterol depletion. Alterations in autophagy are reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, whether the regulation of SREBP‑2 restores dysfunctional autophagy in hepatocytes during NAFLD remains to be elucidated. In the present study, a steatosis model was established with palmitic acid (PA) treatment at the indicated times and concentrations. Autophagosomes in hepatocytes were visualized by confocal microscopy after transfection with a tandem GFP‑mCherry‑LC3 construct. Autophagy‑associated protein levels were analyzed by western blot analysis. Loss‑ and gain‑of‑function studies were performed to examine the role of SREBP‑2 in the regulation of hepatocyte autophagy. It was demonstrated that PA induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux at the early stage, whereas prolonged treatment with PA resulted in dysfunction of autophagy in the PA‑induced steatotic hepatocytes. In addition, different cellular models presented with differing dysfunctional autophagy in response to fatty acid overload. It was also confirmed that SREBP‑2 regulated autophagy‑related gene expression in hepatocytes, and it was shown that the overexpression of SREBP‑2 increased the expression of autophagy‑related genes, but did not affect the inhibition of the autophagic flux in lipid‑overloaded HL‑7702 cells. By contrast, increased SREBP‑2 partly restored the inhibited autophagic activity in lipid‑overloaded hepatoma HepG2 cells. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that autophagic function was impaired in lipid‑overloaded human hepatocytes, and the differential effect of PA on autophagy was associated with the duration of PA and the cell type. Under these conditions, the overexpression of SREBP‑2 alleviated the inhibited autophagic activity rather than the inhibition of autophagic flux. Consequently, the results indicated that restoration of autophagy dysfunction via the regulation of SREBP‑2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD."

Following duplication, genes can exhibit divergence in their coding sequence and their expression patterns. Changes in the cis-regulatory element landscape can result in changes in gene expression patterns. High-throughput methods developed recently can identify potential cis-regulatory elements on a genome-wide scale. Here, we use a recent comprehensive data set of DNase I sequencing-identified cis-regulatory binding sites (footprints) at single-base-pair resolution to compare binding sites and network connectivity in duplicated gene pairs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that duplicated gene pairs vary greatly in their cis-regulatory element architecture, resulting in changes in regulatory network connectivity. Whole-genome duplicates (WGDs) have approximately twice as many footprints in their promoters left by potential regulatory proteins than do tandem duplicates (TDs). The WGDs have a greater average number of footprint differences between paralogs than TDs. The footprints, in turn, result in more regulatory network connections between WGDs and other genes, forming denser, more complex regulatory networks than shown by TDs. When comparing regulatory connections between duplicates, WGDs had more pairs in which the two genes are either partially or fully diverged in their network connections, but fewer genes with no network connections than the TDs. There is evidence of younger TDs and WGDs having fewer unique connections compared with older duplicates. This study provides insights into cis-regulatory element evolution and network divergence in duplicated genes. "

The present investigation showed that the hexane fraction of CR rhizome (CRHF) reduced the elevated transcription levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in primary hepatocytes following exposure to the liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist. The SREBP-1c gene is a master regulator of lipogenesis and a key target of LXRα. CRHF inhibited not only the LXRα-dependent activation of the synthetic LXR response element (LXRE) promoter, but also the activation of the natural SREBP-1c promoter. Moreover, CRHF decreased (a) the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the LXRE of the SREBP-1c gene; (b) the LXRα-dependent up-regulation of various lipogenic genes; and (c) the LXRα-mediated accumulation of triglycerides in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, CRHF ameliorated fatty liver disease and reduced the expression levels of hepatic lipogenic genes in high sucrose diet (HSD)-fed mice. Interestingly, CRHF did not affect the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, another important LXR target gene that is required for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and protects against atherosclerosis.

The element is characterized by the appearance of AA or TT dinucleotides in the A + T-rich region located 200-400 bp upstream of the cap sites. G-tracts 3-5 nucleotides long exist between the A + T-rich region and the conserved transcription factor binding sites (GATA-1 site and the CACCC, CCAAT, and ATA boxes) apparently dividing the regions. The average periodicity of AA or TT dinucleotides in the region from a total of 18 β-family globin genes from four species was approximately 10 bp, suggesting that the DNA in these regions shows right-handed superhelicity. The proposed biological function of this element is to adjust the spatial positions for the first interaction of the transcription factor(s) which can recognize specific DNA sequences in the presence of packed chromatin."

One such repeat element, LTR12C, lies within a predicted regulatory region located upstream of the RAE1 gene. We examined the transcriptional activity of LTR12C by using the luciferase assay, and showed that the tandem repeat region (TRR) located within LTR12C was required for its regulatory function. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that the LTR12C element had multiple transcription factor binding sites specific for nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y), and the promoter activity of LTR12C was significantly decreased after NF-Y knockdown. Additionally, we discovered novel data indicating that LTR12C was initially inserted into the gorilla genome. Taken together, our results reveal that the TRR of LTR12C has powerful regulatory activity due to its NF-Y binding sites, and the integration of the LTR12C element into the primate genome during evolution may have affected RAE1 transcription."

This analysis identified serines 331/332 as bona-fide phosphorylation targets of PKA. To determine the functional consequences of phosphorylation at these sites, we constructed mammalian expression vector for both nSREBP-1a and 1c isoforms in which the candidate PKA phosphorylation sites were mutated to active phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable amino acids. The transcriptional activity of SREBP was reduced by the phosphomimetic mutation of S332 of nSREBP-1a and the corresponding serine (S308) of nSREBP-1c. This site is a strong candidate for mediating the negative regulatory effect of glucagon on SREBP-1 and lipogenesis. "

Mammalian SREBPs are proteolytically activated and liberated from the membrane by Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases. Fission yeast SREBPs, Sre1 and Sre2, employ a different mechanism that genetically requires the Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex for cleavage activation. Here, we established Sre2 as a model to define structural requirements for SREBP cleavage. We showed that Sre2 cleavage does not require the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix zipper transcription factor domain, thus separating cleavage of Sre2 from its transcription factor function. From a mutagenesis screen of 94 C-terminal residues of Sre2, we isolated 15 residues required for cleavage and further identified a glycine-leucine sequence required for Sre2 cleavage. Importantly, the glycine-leucine sequence is located at a conserved distance before the first transmembrane segment of both Sre1 and Sre2 and cleavage occurs in between this sequence and the membrane. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a broad conservation of this novel glycine-leucine motif in SREBP homologs of ascomycete fungi, including the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus where SREBP is required for virulence. Consistent with this, the sequence was also required for cleavage of the oxygen-responsive transcription factor Sre1 and adaptation to hypoxia, demonstrating functional conservation of this cleavage recognition motif. These cleavage mutants will aid identification of the fungal SREBP protease and facilitate functional dissection of the Dsc E3 ligase required for SREBP activation and fungal pathogenesis. "

We reported previously that α-LAC intake induced atherogenic dyslipidaemia in Balb/c mice. The aim of the present study was to investigate if this atherogenic effect could be due to a possible α-LAC-induced hepatic steatosis. We examine the ability of dietary α-LAC to induce liver steatosis, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic lipid metabolism in association with the lipid profile, peripheral insulin resistance (IR) and changes in the hepatic oxidative environment. Male Balb/c mice (n 6) were fed with diets containing either chow or 14 % α-LAC for 4 weeks. The α-LAC-fed mice developed abdominal adiposity and IR. Moderate liver steatosis with increased TAG and NEFA contents was correlated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. There was increased nuclear expression of liver X receptor αβ (LXRαβ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and PPARγ transcription factors and of the cytosolic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase involved in the hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The opposite was found for the nuclear receptor PPARα and the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), leading to reduced fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). These changes were associated with a significant decrease in both p-Thr172-AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) (inactivation) and p-Ser79-ACC1 (activation) and with a more oxidative liver environment increasing lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and reducing GSH:GSSG ratio in the α-LAC-fed mice. In conclusion, 4 weeks of 14 % α-LAC feeding induced liver steatosis associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia, IR and oxidative stress by enhancing nuclear LXRαβ/SREBP-1c/PPARγ expression and diminishing PPARα/CPT-1 expression and AMPKα phosphorylation shifting the hepatic FAO toward fatty acid synthesis in Balb/c mice."

Insulin can acetylate, thereby activating sterol regulator element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), a prime transcription factor responsible for expression of genes involved in lipogenesis. Moreover, SREBP-1 upregulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key player in inflammatory signaling. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a representative omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, has been known to negatively regulate SREBP-1, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully clarified yet. This prompted us to investigate whether DHA could inhibit insulin-induced activation of SREBP-1 and COX-2 expression in the context of its potential protective effect on obesity-induced inflammation and carcinogenesis. SIRT1, a NAD(+)-dependent histone/non-histone protein deacetylase, has been reported to inhibit intracellular signaling mediated by SREBP-1 through deacetylation of this transcription factor. We found that DHA induced SIRT1 expression in CCD841CoN human colon epithelial cells. DHA abrogated insulin-induced acetylation as well as expression of SREBP-1 and COX-2 upregulation. Insulin-induced stimulation of CCD841CoN cell migration was also inhibited by DHA. These effects mediated by DHA were attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of SIRT1. Hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance is considered to be associated with obesity-associated inflammation. Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice showed higher colonic expression levels of both SREBP-1 and COX-2 than did normal lean mice. Likewise, expression of SREBP-1 and COX-2 was elevated in human colon tumor specimens compared with surrounding normal tissues. In conclusion, DHA may protect against obesity-associated inflammation and colon carcinogenesis by suppressing insulin-induced activation of SREBP-1 and expression of COX-2 through up-regulation of SIRT1."

In this study, the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1 and -2 was examined by transfection studies of cDNA-encoding mutants in which all the known cleavage sites were disrupted. In cultured cells, sterol-regulated SREBP-2 processing was completely eliminated by mutation of cleavage sites. In contrast, the corresponding SREBP-1c mutants as well as wild type exhibited large amounts of cleaved products in the nuclear extracts from culture cells and murine liver in vivo. The nuclear form of the mutant SREBP-1c was induced by delipidated condition and suppressed by eicosapentaenoic acid, an n-3 PUFA, but not by sterols. This novel processing mechanism was affected by neither SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) nor insulin-induced gene (Insig)-1, unlike SREBP-2, but abolished by a serine protease inhibitor. Through analysis of deletion mutant, a site-2 protease recognition sequence (DRSR) was identified to be involved in this novel processing. These findings suggest that SREBP-1c cleavage could be subjected to a novel PUFA-regulated cleavage system in addition to the sterol-regulatory SCAP/Insig system. "

Transcriptional activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) is one of the major downstream signaling pathways triggered by the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins. In a previous study in neuroblastoma cells, we have shown that statins consistently induce the upregulation of presynaptic dopaminergic proteins and changes of their function and these effects were accompanied by downstream activation of SREBP. In this study, we aimed to determine the direct role of SREBP pathway in the modulation of dopaminergic phenotype. We demonstrate that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with U18666A, an SREBP activator, increases the translocation of SREBPs into the nucleus, increases the expression of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and of the presynaptic dopaminergic markers such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A and 2 C, synaptogyrin-3, and tyrosine hydroxylase. The addition of SREBP inhibitor, PF-429242, blocks the increase of U18666A-induced expression of SREBPs and presynaptic markers. Our results, in line with previously reported effects of statins, demonstrate that direct stimulation of SREBP translocation is associated to differentiation toward a dopaminergic-like phenotype and suggest that SREBP-mediated transcriptional activity may lead to the restoration of the presynaptic dopamine markers and may contribute to neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons. These findings further support the potential protective role of statin in PD and shed light upon SREBP as a potential new target for developing disease-modifying treatment in PD."

Common IL13 variants are associated with allergy phenotypes in populations of distinct ethnic background. We recently demonstrated that IL13 expression by human CD4+ T cells is paralleled by extensive IL13 locus remodeling, which results in the appearance of multiple DNase I hypersensitive sites. Among these, HS4 in the distal promoter is constitutive in both naïve and polarized Th1 and Th2 cells, and spans a common single nucleotide polymorphism, IL13-1512A>C (rs1881457), strongly associated with total serum IgE levels. We recently characterized HS4 as a novel cis-acting element that upregulates IL13 transcription in activated human and murine T cells. Here we show that IL13-1512A>C is a functional polymorphism that significantly enhances HS4-dependent IL13 expression by creating a binding site for the transcription factor Oct-1. Of note, endogenous Oct-1 was preferentially recruited to the IL13-1512C risk allele in primary CD4+ T cells from IL13-1512A>C heterozygous subjects. Moreover, the IL13-1512C allele was overexpressed in transfected Th2 cells from Oct1(+/+) mice, but not from Oct1(+/-) mice, demonstrating that increased activity was exquisitely dependent on physiologic levels of Oct-1.

These genes are located in a head-to-head orientation, sharing a 5'-flanking region. Reporter assays were thus performed with dual-reporter constructs, containing the whole or partially deleted human CYP1A promoter between two different reporter genes. In this system, human CAR (hCAR) enhanced the transcription of both genes through common promoter regions from -461 to -554 and from -18089 to -21975 of CYP1A1. With reporter assays using additional deleted and mutated constructs, electrophoresis mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, an ER8 motif (everted repeat separated by eight nucleotides), located at around -520 of CYP1A1, was identified as an hCAR-responsive element and a binding motif of hCAR/human retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimer. hCAR enhanced the transcription of both genes also in the presence of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand. Finally, hCAR activation increased CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA levels in cultured human hepatocytes. Our results indicate that CAR transactivates human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in human hepatocytes through the common cis-element ER8.

The reduction of total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester concentrations was confirmed in hexacosanol-stimulated hepatocytes (-38%, -33%, and -53%, respectively). Plasma, hepatic cholesterol concentrations, and hepatic steatosis were significantly reduced in high-fat-fed mice orally administered with hexacosanol (0.7 mg/kg body weight a day) for 8 weeks compared with those of vehicle-fed control mice (-15% and -40%, respectively). Hexacosanol in fact bound to the allosteric regulation site of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-β subunit and thus activated AMPK that inhibited the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase by inhibitory phosphorylation. In addition, activation of AMPK by hexacosanol induced hepatic autophagy activity, which could further reduce hepatic lipid accumulation. Alternatively, hexacosanol suppressed the nuclear translocation and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), a key transcription factor in cholesterol biosynthesis. These results collectively suggest that hexacosanol is a major hypocholesterolemic compound in barley sprouts with regulation of AMPK activation and SREBP-2 suppression. These suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase at both mRNA expression and protein activity levels. In conclusion, hexacosanol activates AMPK and hepatic autophagy and inhibits SREBP2, resulting in hypocholesterolemic activities and improvement of hepatic steatosis."

This compound also showed broad HBV genotype coverage, but was inactive against a panel of DNA and RNA viruses of other species. Oral administration of DHQ-1 in the AAV-HBV mouse model resulted in a significant reduction of serum HBsAg as soon as 4 days following the commencement of treatment. Reduction of HBV markers in both in vitro and in vivo experiments was related to the reduced amount of viral RNA including pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) and 2.4/2.1 kb HBsAg mRNA. Nuclear run-on and subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that DHQ-1 mediated HBV RNA reduction was the result of accelerated viral RNA degradation in the nucleus, rather than the consequence of inhibition of transcription initiation. Through mutagenesis of HBsAg gene sequences, we found induction of HBsAg mRNA decay by DHQ-1 required the presence of the HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (HPRE), with a 109 nucleotides sequence within the central region of the HPRE alpha sub-element being the most critical. Taken together, the current study shows that a small molecule can reduce the overall levels of HBV RNA, especially the HBsAg mRNA, and viral surface proteins. This may shed light on the development of a new class of HBV therapeutics."

As the master switch of cholesterol biosynthesis, the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) translocates to the nucleus after cleavage/activation, but its expression and activation have not been studied in AD which is the focus of the current study. We found both a significant decrease in the nuclear translocation of N-terminal SREBP-2 accompanied by a significant accumulation of C-terminal SREBP-2 in NFT-containing pyramidal neurons in AD. N-terminal- SREBP-2 is also found in dystrophic neurites around plaques in AD brain. Western blot confirmed a significantly reduced nuclear translocation of mature SREBP-2 (mSREBP-2) in AD brain. Interestingly, reduced nuclear mSREBP-2 was only found in animal models of tauopathies such as 3XTg AD mice and P301L Tau Tg mice but not in CRND8 APP transgenic mice, suggesting that tau alterations likely are involved in the changes of mSREBP-2 distribution and activation in AD. Altogether, our study demonstrated disturbed SREBP-2 signaling in AD and related models, and proved for the first time that tau alterations contribute to disturbed cholesterol homeostasis in AD likely through modulation of nuclear mSREBP-2 translocation."

The ZTRE has two nucleotide components-the palindromic flanking pairs and the bridging ""N"" bases between these flanks that range in number from 0 to 100. There are 12 pairs of ZTRE flanks (designated A-L). Three thousand five hundred twenty-five genes contain one or more ZTREs - 1000 to + 200 bp from their transcriptional start site (TSS). ZTRE-E is observed at a greater frequency, and ZTRE containing 25 bridging bases are less frequent, within - 200 bp from the TSS. The genes with ZTREs in this range are enriched in processes that may compensate zinc deficiency, while other genes with ZTREs outside this range are enriched in transcriptional activation processes. The division of ZTREs into two groups may imply a dual role of ZNF658, similar to the homologous yeast protein Zap1, via binding to low or high affinity sequences dependent upon cellular zinc.

Often, these sequences are usually present separate from each other in exonic/intronic sequences. The Composite Exonic Splicing Regulatory Elements (CERES) represent an extreme physical overlap of enhancer/silencer activity. As a result, when CERES elements are mutated the consequences on the splicing process are difficult to predict. Here, we show that the functional activity of the CERES2 sequence in CFTR exon 12 is regulated by the binding, in very close proximity to each other, of several SR and hnRNP proteins. Moreover, our results show that practically the entire exon 12 sequence context participate in its definition. The consequences of this situation can be observed at the evolutionary level by comparing changes in conservation of different splicing elements in different species. In conclusion, our study highlights how it is increasingly difficult to define many exonic sequences by simply breaking them down in isolated enhancer/silencer or even neutral elements. The real picture is close to one of continuous competition between positive and negative factors where affinity for the target sequences and other dynamic factors decide the inclusion or exclusion of the exon."

Genome-wide analysis of known plant CREs was performed for all currently predicted protein-coding gene promoters in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Many CREs such as abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive, drought-responsive, auxin-responsive, and evening elements, exhibit bona fide CRE properties such as strong position bias towards the transcription start site (TSS) and over-representation when compared with random promoters. Genes containing these CREs are enriched in a large repertoire of plant biological pathways. Large-scale transcriptome analyses also show that these CREs are highly implicated in grapevine development and stress response. Numerous CRE-driven modules in condition-specific gene co-expression networks (GCNs) were identified and many of these modules were highly enriched for plant biological functions. Several modules corroborate known roles of CREs in drought response, pathogen defense, cell wall metabolism, and fruit ripening, whereas others reveal novel functions in plants. Comparisons with Arabidopsis suggest a general conservation in promoter architecture, gene expression dynamics, and GCN structure across species. Systems analyses of CREs provide insights into the grapevine cis-regulatory code and establish a foundation for future genomic studies in grapevine."

We investigated SREBPs' role during oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and differentiating oligodendrocytes. Using the selective site-1 protease (S1P) inhibitor PF-429242, which inhibits the cleavage of SREBP precursor forms into mature forms, we found that preventing SREBP processing inhibited process growth and reduced the expression level of myelin basic protein, a major component of myelin. Further, process extension deficits could be rescued by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Blocking SREBP processing reduced mRNA transcription and protein levels of SREBP target genes involved in both the fatty acid and the cholesterol synthetic pathways. Furthermore, de novo levels and total levels of cholesterol synthesis were greatly diminished when SREBP processing was inhibited.

In the presence of atherogenic molecules such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) macrophages accumulate massive amounts of lipid through uptake. However, in the presence of oxLDL mechanism of dysregulated lipid homeostasis in the macrophages remains largely unknown. Herein we have investigated the role of Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 in oxLDL-induced inflammation and altered lipid homeostasis in macrophages. The U937 monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were stimulated with different doses of oxLDL. MTT assay to study the effect of oxLDL on cell viability, Oil-Red-O (ORO) staining to observe cytosolic lipid accumulation, semi-quantitative PCR and Western blotting to analyze mRNA and protein expressions, respectively, and spectrophotometric assay to measure the lipid synthesizing enzyme's activity were performed. Our results indicate that oxLDL increased proliferation in monocytes and decreased the viability in MDMs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The oxLDL (100 μg/ml) enhanced lipid accumulation via increased expressions of SREBP-1 and its downstream proteins such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) at both RNA and protein levels in monocytes as well as in MDMs. Inhibiting SREBP-1 by a synthetic inhibitor prevented excessive lipid accumulation by downregulating the expression of its downstream proteins. Further, oxLDL increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and active interleukin 1β (IL-1β) release in both the cell types. The oxLDL-induced NLRP3 could be responsible for SREBP-1 and downstream proteins overexpression as siRNA silencing of NLRP3 decreased SERBP-1 levels. In summary, we have demonstrated that SREBP-1 could be a key player in oxLDL-induced excessive lipid accumulation leading to macrophage FCF via ROS-mediated NLRP3/IL-1β/SREBP-1 pathway."

These results suggested that osthol might exert the therapeutic effect on fat milk-induced fatty liver in mice, by inhibiting hepatic SREBP-1c/2 mRNA expressions and subsequent modulation of SREBP-1c/2-mediated target genes such as FAS, CYP7A and LDL receptor."

Increased lipogenesis has been reported to play a critical role in HCC progression. However, the underlying mechanism contributing to lipogenesis increase in HCC remains elusive. Here, we show that HCC-associated protein TD26 (TD26) was highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues compared to matched normal tissues. From the clinicopathologic analyses of two independent HCC cohorts, we demonstrate that TD26 expression was positively correlated with tumor size and was an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in HCC patients. Our metabolomics assays demonstrate that TD26 had no effect on glycometabolism, but significantly increased lipogenesis in HCC cells. In addition, our functional assays indicate that TD26 promoted HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. We further demonstrate that TD26-mediated increase in lipogenesis and tumor cell proliferation was SREBP1 dependent. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that, through its C-terminus (amino acids [aa] from 121 to 198), TD26 interacted with the truncated nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) form (nSREBP1), but not full-length SREBP1 (flSREBP1), to block adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated inhibition on SREBP1 activity, resulting in increased lipogenesis, elevated tumor cell proliferation, and enhanced tumor progression. Conclusion: We propose that TD26 is a positive regulator on SREBP1 transactivity, and the interaction between TD26 and SREBP1 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment."

Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle."

GSH is especially important for antioxidant defense system since beta-cells show intrinsically low expression of antioxidant enzymes. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms by which quercetin, a flavonoid, induces the expression of the GCLC gene in rat pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1. Promoter study found that the proximal GC-rich region (from -90 to -34) of the GCLC promoter contained the quercetin-responsive cis-element(s). The quercetin-responsive region contains consensus DNA binding site for early growth response 1 (EGR1) at -67 (5'-CGCCTCCGC-3') which overlaps with a putative Sp1 binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that an oligonucleotide containing the EGR1 site was bound to nuclear factors EGR1, Sp1, and Sp3. In the promoter analysis, mutation of EGR1 site significantly reduced the quercetin response, whereas mutation of Sp1 site decreased only the basal activity of the GCLC promoter. Additionally, the transient overexpression of EGR1 significantly increased basal activity of the GCLC promoter. Finally, we showed that quercetin potently induced both EGR1 mRNA and its protein levels without affecting the expression of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Therefore, we concluded that EGR1 was bound to GC-rich region of the GCLC gene promoter, which was prerequisite for the transactivation of the GCLC gene by quercetin."

Our approach makes minimal assumptions about the background sequence model and the mechanisms by which elements affect gene expression. This provides a versatile motif discovery framework, across all data types and genomes, with exceptional sensitivity and near-zero false-positive rates. Applications from yeast to human uncover putative and established transcription-factor binding and miRNA target sites, revealing rich diversity in their spatial configurations, pervasive co-occurrences of DNA and RNA motifs, context-dependent selection for motif avoidance, and the strong impact of posttranscriptional processes on eukaryotic transcriptomes."

High BMP2 levels promote osteogenesis or chondrogenesis and low levels promote adipogenesis. BMP2 inhibits myogenesis. Thus, BMP2 synthesis is tightly controlled. Several hundred nucleotides within the 3' untranslated regions of BMP2 genes are conserved from mammals to fishes indicating that the region is under stringent selective pressure. Our analyses indicate that this region controls BMP2 synthesis by post-transcriptional mechanisms. A common A to C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the BMP2 gene (rs15705, +A1123C) disrupts a putative post-transcriptional regulatory motif within the human ultra-conserved sequence. In vitro studies indicate that RNAs bearing the A or C alleles have different protein binding characteristics in extracts from mesenchymal cells. Reporter genes with the C allele of the ultra-conserved sequence were differentially expressed in mesenchymal cells. Finally, we analyzed MRI data from the upper arm of 517 healthy individuals aged 18-41 years. Individuals with the C/C genotype were associated with lower baseline subcutaneous fat volumes (P = 0.0030) and an increased gain in skeletal muscle volume (P = 0.0060) following resistance training in a cohort of young males. The rs15705 SNP explained 2-4% of inter-individual variability in the measured parameters. The rs15705 variant is one of the first genetic markers that may be exploited to facilitate early diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention of diseases associated with poor fitness. Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms by which regulatory polymorphisms influence BMP2 synthesis will reveal novel pharmaceutical targets for these disabling conditions."

Glutamine increases the mRNA levels of several SREBP targets, including SREBP-2. The gene expression of SREBP-1a, a predominant form of SREBP-1 in most cultured cells and a target of the general transcription factor Sp1, is significantly augmented by glutamine via an increased binding of Sp1 to the SREBP-1a promoter. In contrast, the increased expression of SREBP targets including SREBP-2 is due to stimulation of the processing of SREBP proteins by glutamine. It is also shown that glutamine accelerates SREBP processing through increased transport of the SREBP/SREBP cleavage-activating protein complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The processing of activating transcription factor 6 is activated by the same proteases as SREBPs in the Golgi in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and is not induced by glutamine. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that glutamine brings about not only the induction of SREBP-1a transcription but also the stimulation of SREBP processing, thereby facilitating the gene expression of SREBP targets in cultured cells."

Using tissues from the articulating joints of 260 patients with OA and a range of in vitro experiments, including CRISPR-Cas9, we have characterized an intergenic regulatory element. Here, genotype at an OA risk locus correlates with differential DNA methylation, with altered gene expression of both a transcriptional regulator (RUNX2), and a chromatin remodelling protein (SUPT3H). RUNX2 is a strong candidate for OA susceptibility, with its encoded protein being essential for skeletogenesis and healthy joint function. The OA risk locus includes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within and flanking the differentially methylated region (DMR). The OA association SNP, rs10948172, demonstrates particularly strong correlation with methylation, and two intergenic SNPs falling within the DMR (rs62435998 and rs62435999) demonstrate genetic and epigenetic effects on the regulatory activity of this region. We therefore posit that the OA signal mediates its effect by modulating the methylation of the regulatory element, which then impacts on gene expression, with RUNX2 being the principal target. Our study highlights the interplay between DNA methylation, OA genetic risk and the downstream regulation of genes critical to normal joint function."

Gene expression of Akt1 in different lactation stages was also investigated. For in vitro studies, a eukaryotic expression vector of Akt1 was constructed and transfected to goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs), and specific inhibitors of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling were applied to GMECs. Results showed that Akt1 protein was highly conserved, and its mRNA was highly expressed in midlactation. In vitro studies indicated that Akt1 phosphorylation activated mTOR and subsequently enhanced sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), thus increasing intracellular triacylglycerol content. Inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling down-regulated the gene expression of lipogenic genes. Overall, Akt1 plays an important role in regulating de novo fatty acid synthesis in goat mammary epithelial cells, and this process probably is through the mTOR/SREBP1 axis."

Both null and dead activity [D337A] mutants of sppA failed to grow in hypoxia, and the growth defect of ΔsppA was complemented by nuclear SrbA-N381 expression. Additionally, SppA interacted with SrbA in the endoplasmic reticulum, where SppA localized in normoxia and hypoxia. Expression of the truncated SrbA-N414 covering the SrbA sequence prior to the second transmembrane region rescued the growth of ΔdscA but not of ΔsppA in hypoxia. Unlike ΔdscA and ΔdscA;ΔsppA double mutants, in which SrbA cleavage was blocked, the molecular weight of cleaved SrbA increased in ΔsppA compared to the control strain in immunoblot analyses. Overall, our data demonstrate the sequential cleavage of SrbA by Dsc-linked proteolysis followed by SppA, proposing a new model of RIP for SREBP cleavage in fungal hypoxia adaptation. Furthermore, the function of SppA in hypoxia adaptation was consistent in Aspergillus fumigatus, suggesting the potential roles of SppA in fungal pathogenesis."

However, the mechanism controlling this regulation is not well defined. Through characterizing an additional 1000 bp of upstream DNA sequences of the murine p53 gene, we identified new positive and negative regulatory elements. Furthermore, we found a trans-acting factor(s) that binds within a positive cis-acting element (-972/-953) in a manner indicative of regulation during the cell cycle. When Swiss3T3 cells are arrested by serum depletion p53 mRNA levels decrease and binding of this regulatory factor(s) to the promoter is reduced. Upon serum stimulation, the regulatory factor(s) binds the promoter and p53 mRNA levels increase prior to the cells entering S phase. When the factors are experimentally sequestered from the promoter or when the regulatory element is deleted from the promoter, p53 promoter activity is reduced. There is no further reduction in p53 promoter activity upon serum depletion and the kinetics of induction upon serum stimulation is delayed by approximately 5 h. These findings indicate that a factor(s) binding within the -972/-953 regulatory element on the p53 promoter is important for the proper regulation of p53 mRNA expression in response to mitogen stimulation. Our initial findings indicate that a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors may play a role in this regulation."

Relatedly, the vast majority of candidate regulatory elements have yet to be functionally validated. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based system that uses pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to program thousands of kilobase-scale deletions that deeply scan across a targeted region in a tiling fashion (""ScanDel""). We applied ScanDel to HPRT1, the housekeeping gene underlying Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder. Altogether, we programmed 4,342 overlapping 1 and 2 kb deletions that tiled 206 kb centered on HPRT1 (including 87 kb upstream and 79 kb downstream) with median 27-fold redundancy per base. We functionally assayed programmed deletions in parallel by selecting for loss of HPRT function with 6-thioguanine. As expected, sequencing gRNA pairs before and after selection confirmed that all HPRT1 exons are needed. However, HPRT1 function was robust to deletion of any intergenic or deeply intronic non-coding region, indicating that proximal regulatory sequences are sufficient for HPRT1 expression. Although our screen did identify the disruption of exon-proximal non-coding sequences (e.g., the promoter) as functionally consequential, long-read sequencing revealed that this signal was driven by rare, imprecise deletions that extended into exons. Our results suggest that no singular distal regulatory element is required for HPRT1 expression and that distal mutations are unlikely to contribute substantially to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome burden. Further application of ScanDel could shed light on the role of regulatory mutations in disease at other loci while also facilitating a deeper understanding of endogenous gene regulation."

Previously, we reported that a damage resistance protein (Dap) family, composed of DapA, DapB, and DapC, could respond to azole stress stimuli in Aspergillus fumigatus, although the exact response mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, RNA-seq analysis found that a total of 180 genes are induced by azole in a dapA-dependent manner. These genes are involved in oxidation-reduction, metabolic processes, and transmembrane transport. Following azole stress stimuli, DapA and DapC consistently show a stable endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localization pattern. In comparison, the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein SrbA is capable of nuclear translocation from the ER after azole-stress stimuli, suggesting that SrbA, but not Daps, can directly sense azole stress. Moreover, we found that SrbA is required for the normal expression of DapA and DapC but not of DapB. In addition, in the absence of SrbA, the enhanced expression of DapA induced by azole-itraconazole is blocked, indicating that SrbA is required for the DapA response to azole stress. Double mutants together with overexpression experiments suggest that DapA might act downstream of SrbA to respond to azole stress stimuli. Compared with the ΔsrbA strain, no additional increase in sensitivity was observed in the double mutants ΔsrbAΔdapB and ΔsrbAΔdapC, indicating that DapA might be of central importance in the response to azole drugs.

Here, we observed expression of Preb in the mouse liver, in connection with glucose homeostasis.

We further demonstrate that Preb negatively influences gluconeogenic gene expression, by directly binding to their promoters at a prolactin core-binding element (PCBE). A better understanding of Preb gene expression, during the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance, could ultimately provide new avenues for therapies for metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type-2 diabetes mellitus, disorders whose worldwide incidences are increasing drastically."

Here we describe a massively parallel experiment to systematically test the impact of copy number, spacing, combination and order of transcription factor binding sites on gene expression. A complex library of ∼5,000 synthetic regulatory elements containing patterns from 12 liver-specific transcription factor binding sites was assayed in mice and in HepG2 cells. We find that certain transcription factors act as direct drivers of gene expression in homotypic clusters of binding sites, independent of spacing between sites, whereas others function only synergistically. Heterotypic enhancers are stronger than their homotypic analogs and favor specific transcription factor binding site combinations, mimicking putative native enhancers. Exhaustive testing of binding site permutations suggests that there is flexibility in binding site order. Our findings provide quantitative support for a flexible model of regulatory element activity and suggest a framework for the design of synthetic tissue-specific enhancers. "

The relative level of each mRNA varies from tissue to tissue and they respond differently to regulatory stimuli. SREBP-1c is more abundantly expressed in liver, where its level is also regulated by insulin and liver X receptor activators, and it is also autoregulated by SREBPs. In contrast, SREBP-1a mRNA levels are relatively low and constant in different tissues and few studies have specifically analysed its pattern of expression and regulation. In the present study, we show that the promoter for SREBP-1a is contained in a very small promoter-proximal region containing two Sp1 sites. The small and relatively simple structure for its promoter provides an explanation for the low level of SREBP-1a expression. Additionally, since Sp1 has been implicated in the modest regulation of several genes by insulin, its involvement in the expression of the SREBP-1a promoter provides an explanation for the modest insulin regulation observed in animal experiments."

The carboxylesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of various xenobiotics and endogenous substrates such as ester, amide and thioester bonds and are thought to function mainly in drug metabolism. We have suggested the possibility that individual variation of human liver carboxylesterase activity causes the difference in expression levels of CES1A isozymes. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of human carboxylesterase genes. In the present study, we isolated two CES genes encoding human carboxylesterase CES1A, which were designated as CES1A1 (AB119997) and CES1A2 (AB119998). These genes were identical except for exon 1 and the 5' regulatory element. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of these two CES genes. A reporter gene assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Sp1 and C/EBPalpha could bind to each responsive element of the CES1A1 promoter but that the Sp1 and C/EBP could not bind to the responsive element of the CES1A2 promoter. Thus, CES1A1 mRNA expression level is much higher than the expression level of CES1A2 mRNA in the liver and lung. It is thought that these results provide information on individual variation of human carboxylesterase isozymes."

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) are major transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes regulating fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Here we show that elaidic acid upregulates hepatic de-novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in HuH-7 cells. To define the molecular mechanism involved in this unique regulation on hepatic lipogenesis, luciferase reporter gene assays were performed in HEK293 cells to compare the regulation of sterol regulatory element (SRE) that is present in SREBP-target promoter by elaidic acid and oleic acid. The results show that elaidic acid potently induced SRE-luciferase activity, whereas oleic acid inhibited this activity. Furthermore, elaidic acid increased SREBP-1c mRNA, while oleic acid did not alter it. Oleic acid inhibited mature form of SREBP-1 protein level, while elaidic acid did not show inhibitory effects. In addition, elaidic acid was also found to increase several selected lipogenic genes that are involved in fatty acids and sterol synthesis. These data demonstrate a unique role of elaidic acid, the most abundant trans fatty acid, in modulating hepatic lipogenesis. "

Four groups of rats (n = 8) of control (12% of calories as fat) and HFD (40% of calories as fat) were administered orally with either normal saline as a vehicle or RES as a concomitant treatment for 8 weeks on a daily basis. Then, various biochemical, histological, and molecular experiments were carried out. RES prevented the development and progression of NAFLD and significantly improved insulin sensitivity through (1) inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs-1 and SREBPs-2 without affecting their precursor mRNA or protein levels, (2) inhibiting free fatty acid β-oxidation and generation of reactive oxygen species through significant inhibition of CPT-1 and UCP-2, and (3) decreasing activity of pancreatic lipase in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our findings are the first in the literature to show new mechanisms of the hepatoprotective effect of RES against HFD induced NAFLD in rats."

The mRNA levels of liver X receptor α, carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1), and fatty acid synthase were detected. The caged chicken exhibited significantly higher BW, SFT, and AFW than those of free-ranged chicken (P < 0.05). All the 4 genes had a similar expression pattern, and they showed the highest level in caged chicken, while the lowest level was found in free-ranged chicken. Association analysis indicated that there were significant (P < 0.05) or highly significant (P < 0.01) positive correlations between the mRNA levels of ChREBP, SREBP1, and fat traits of SFT, AFW, and AFP. Thus, we deduced that increased fat deposition in caged chicken was probably induced by increased gene expression of ChREBP and SREBP1 in the liver. "

Differential expression analysis with PLIER corrected data was performed using AltAnalyze. Searching for over-representation in biochemical pathways revealed cholesterol metabolism being most prominently affected in DUhTP compared to unselected control mice. Furthermore, pathway analysis by AltAnalyze plus PathVisio indicated significant induction of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of DUhTP mice versus unselected control mice. In contrast, gluconeogenesis was partially inactivated as judged from the analysis of hepatic mRNA transcript abundance in DUhTP mice. Analysis of mRNA transcripts related to steroid hormone metabolism inferred elevated synthesis of progesterone and reduced levels of sex steroids. Abundance of steroid delta isomerase-5 mRNA (Hsd3b5, FC 4.97) was increased and steroid 17-alpha-monooxygenase mRNA (Cyp17a1, FC -11.6) was massively diminished in the liver of DUhTP mice. Assessment of steroid profiles by LC-MS revealed increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of sex steroids in serum from DUhTP mice versus controls. Analysis of hepatic mRNA transcript abundance indicates that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) may play a major role in metabolic pathway activation in the marathon mouse model DUhTP. Thus, results from bioinformatics modeling of hepatic mRNA transcript abundance correlated with direct steroid analysis by mass spectrometry and further indicated functions of SREBP-1 and steroid hormones for endurance performance in DUhTP mice.

DHA can be metabolized to resolvins and neuroprotectins that have anti-inflammatory properties and effects on neural plasticity. Recent studies show an important role of prefrontal cortical iPLA2 in hippocampo-prefrontal cortical LTP and antidepressant-like effect of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) antidepressant, maprotiline. In this study, we elucidated the cellular mechanisms through which stimulation of adrenergic receptors could lead to increased iPLA2 expression. Treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with maprotiline, another tricyclic antidepressant with noradrenaline reuptake inhibiting properties, nortriptyline, and the adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine, resulted in increased iPLA2β mRNA expression. This increase was blocked by inhibitors to alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). Maprotiline and phenylephrine induced binding of SREBP-2 to sterol regulatory element (SRE) region on the iPLA2 promoter, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Together, results indicate that stimulation of adrenoreceptors causes increased iPLA2 expression via MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 and SREBP, and suggest a possible mechanism for effect of CNS noradrenaline on neural plasticity and crosstalk between sterol and glycerophospholipid mediators, that may play a role in physiological or pathophysiological processes in the brain and other organs.

To link chemical exposure to SREBP activity, a previously characterized gene expression biomarker (Rooney et al., 2019) was used to identify microarray comparisons from rat liver that exhibited significant positive or negative correlation to the biomarker. The effects of 620 chemicals on SREBP activity were examined across 9305 chemical-dose-time microarray comparisons. SREBP was found to be frequently modulated by chemical exposure with 54% of the chemicals affecting SREBP activity. Activators included inhibitors of cholesterogenesis that act to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (statins) or inhibit Cyp51 (conazoles). Most chemical effects were transient, lasting usually no more than 2-4 days. Modulation of SREBP in most cases led to coordinated increases or decreases in lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes. However, 570 chemical exposure conditions were identified in which regulation was uncoupled. Most of these conditions affected cholesterogenic genes in the absence of parallel effects on lipogenic genes. Together, these findings show that SREBP is a frequent target of chemical exposure and expression of lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes can be uncoupled."

We have analysed the conservation and divergence of the FIRE DNA sequence in vertebrates. FIRE is present in the same location in the Csf1r locus in reptile, avian and mammalian genomes. Nearest neighbor analysis based upon this element alone largely recapitulates phylogenies inferred from much larger genomic sequence datasets. One core element, containing binding sites for AP1 family and the macrophage-specific transcription factor, PU.1, is conserved from lizards to humans. Around this element, the FIRE sequence is conserved within clades with the most conserved elements containing motifs for known myeloid-expressed transcription factors. Conversely, there is little alignment between clades outside the AP1/PU.1 element. The analysis favours a hybrid between ""enhanceosome"" and ""smorgasbord"" models of enhancer function, in which elements cooperate to bind components of the available transcription factor milieu."

In this study, we found that a partial TE (Taguchi) inserted in the cis-regulatory region of the silkworm ecdysone oxidase (EO) gene, which encodes a crucial enzyme to reduce the titer of molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E). The TE insertion occurred during domestication of silkworm and the frequency of the TE insertion in the domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) is high, 54.24%. The linkage disequilibrium in the TE inserted strains of the domesticated silkworm was elevated. Molecular population genetics analyses suggest that this TE insertion is adaptive for the domesticated silkworm. Luminescent reporter assay shows that the TE inserted in the cis-regulatory region of the EO gene functions as a 20E-induced enhancer of the gene expression. Further, phenotypic bioassay indicates that the silkworm with the TE insertion exhibited more stable developmental phenotype than the silkworm without the TE insertion when suffering from food shortage. Thus, the inserted TE in the cis-regulatory region of the EO gene increased developmental uniformity of silkworm individuals through regulating 20E metabolism, partially explaining transformation of a domestication developmental trait in the domesticated silkworm. Our results emphasize the exceptional role of gene expression regulation in developmental transition of domesticated animals. "

In agreement with previous reports, we found that most genetic variants have weak effects on distal regulatory element activity. Because haplotypes are typically maintained within but not between assayed regulatory elements, the approach can be used to identify causal regulatory haplotypes that likely contribute to human phenotypes.

In this study, we screened the Schizosaccharomyces pombe non-essential haploid deletion collection to identify missing components of the Sre1 cleavage machinery. Our screen identified an additional component of the SREBP pathway required for Sre1 proteolysis named rhomboid protein 2 (Rbd2). We show that an rbd2 deletion mutant fails to grow under hypoxic and hypoxia-mimetic conditions due to lack of Sre1 activity and that this growth phenotype is rescued by Sre1N, a cleaved active form of Sre1. We found that the growth inhibition phenotype under low oxygen conditions is specific to the strain with deletion of rbd2, not any other fission yeast rhomboid-encoding genes. Our study also identified conserved residues of Rbd2 that are required for Sre1 proteolytic cleavage. All together, our results suggest that Rbd2 is a functional SREBP protease with conserved residues required for Sre1 cleavage and provide an important piece of the puzzle to understand the mechanisms for Sre1 activation and the regulation of various biological and pathological processes involving SREBPs.

Earlier work has determined that a 347 bp fragment (Chr19) of AAVS1 has promoter and transcriptional enhancer activities. In this study, we further characterized this genetic regulation and investigated its application to AAV gene therapy in vitro and in vivo. The Chr19 347 bp fragment was dissected into three regulatory elements in human embryonic kidney cells: (i) TATA-independent promoter activity distributed throughout the fragment regardless of orientation, (ii) an orientation-dependent insulator function near the 5' end and (iii) a 107 bp enhancer region near the 3' end. The small enhancer region, coupled to the mini-CMV promoter, was used to drive the expression of several reporters following transduction by AAV2. In vivo data demonstrated enhanced transgene expression from the Chr19-mini-CMV promoter cassette after tail vein injection primarily in the liver at levels comparable to the chicken beta-actin promoter and higher than the liver-specific TTR promoter (>2-fold). However, we did not observe this increase after muscle injection, suggesting tissue-specific enhancement.

Feeding hamsters HCHFD markedly reduced hepatic Acsl1 mRNA and protein levels as well as acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Decreases in Acsl1 expression strongly correlated with reductions in hepatic Srebp2 mRNA level and mature Srebp2 protein abundance. Conversely, administration of rosuvastatin (RSV) to hamsters increased hepatic Acsl1 expression. These new findings were reproduced in mice treated with RSV or fed the HCHFD. Furthermore, the RSV induction of acyl-CoA activity in mouse liver resulted in increases in plasma and hepatic cholesterol ester concentrations and reductions in free cholesterol amounts. Investigations on different ACSL1 transcript variants in HepG2 cells revealed that the mRNA expression of C-ACSL1 was specifically regulated by the sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, and RSV treatment increased the C-ACSL1 abundance from a minor mRNA species to an abundant transcript. We analyzed 5'-flanking sequence of exon 1C of the human ACSL1 gene and identified one putative SRE site. By performing a promoter activity assay and DNA binding assays, we firmly demonstrated the key role of this SRE motif in SREBP2-mediated activation of C-ACSL1 gene transcription. Finally, we demonstrated that knockdown of endogenous SREBP2 in HepG2 cells lowered ACSL1 mRNA and protein levels. Altogether, this work discovered an unprecedented link between ACSL1 and SREBP2 via the specific regulation of the C-ACSL1 transcript. "

Thyroid epithelial cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is known to inhibit SREBP activation, had about 50% decreased mRNA levels of TPO. Similarly, the mRNA level of TPO was reduced by about 50% in response to siRNA mediated knockdown of both, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Reporter gene assays revealed that overexpression of active SREBP-1c and -2 causes a strong transcriptional activation of the rat TPO gene, which was localized to an approximately 80 bp region in the intron 1 of the rat TPO gene. In vitro- and in vivo-binding of both, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2, to this region in the rat TPO gene could be demonstrated using gel-shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation analysis of the 80 bp region of rat TPO intron 1 revealed two isolated and two overlapping SREBP-binding elements from which one, the overlapping SRE+609/InvSRE+614, was shown to be functional in reporter gene assays. In connection with recent findings that the rat NIS gene is also a SREBP target gene in the thyroid, the present findings suggest that SREBPs may be possible novel targets for pharmacological modulation of thyroid hormone synthesis.

Among those 160 elements, we found 3 E2F1 response elements, an E2F1 consensus sequence, an insulin response element which contained the E2F consensus sequence, and a basal level enhancer (BLE1) which had a nonconsensus E2F binding sequence. BLE1 functioned as multiple copy, with E2F1 in a dose-dependent manner, and had a sequence specificity for E2F1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that BLE1 specifically interacts with E2F1 comparable to the E2F element. Interestingly, transactivation via five copies of BLE1 was not repressed but rather was stimulated by E2F1 in combination with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). The retinoblastoma control element (RCE) contains a direct repeated BLE1 in the c-fos gene promoter which also functioned like the multiple BLE1.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) programed with a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) emerges as a method for genome editing in virtually any organisms. Here we report that targeted DNA fragment inversions and duplications could easily be achieved in human and mouse genomes by CRISPR with two sgRNAs. Specifically, we found that, in cultured human cells and mice, efficient precise inversions of DNA fragments ranging in size from a few tens of bp to hundreds of kb could be generated. In addition, DNA fragment duplications and deletions could also be generated by CRISPR through trans-allelic recombination between the Cas9-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) on two homologous chromosomes (chromatids). Moreover, junctions of combinatorial inversions and duplications of the protocadherin (Pcdh) gene clusters induced by Cas9 with four sgRNAs could be detected. In mice, we obtained founders with alleles of precise inversions, duplications, and deletions of DNA fragments of variable sizes by CRISPR. Interestingly, we found that very efficient inversions were mediated by microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) through short inverted repeats. We showed for the first time that DNA fragment inversions could be transmitted through germlines in mice. Finally, we applied this CRISPR method to a regulatory element of the Pcdhα cluster and found a new role in the regulation of members of the Pcdhγ cluster. This simple and efficient method should be useful in manipulating mammalian genomes to study millions of regulatory DNA elements as well as vast numbers of gene clusters. "

In the present study, by detecting mRNA expression using a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), it was revealed that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is highly expressed in CRC. Using a cell wound healing assay and a cell invasion assay, a novel metastasis-promoting role for SREBP1 in CRC was identified. Furthermore, snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAIL) was identified as a key downstream effector of SREBP1 in CRC by the use of small interfering RNA against SNAIL. Additionally, using co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR assays, it was demonstrated that SREBP1 interacts with c-MYC to enhance the binding of c-MYC to the promoter of the mesenchymal gene, SNAIL, thereby increasing SNAIL expression and accelerating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results indicated a novel role for SREBP1 and provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the c-Myc oncogene in CRC, which may function as a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment."

The number of noncoding variants can be many times of coding variants; many of them are not functional but in linkage disequilibrium with the functional ones; different variants can have epistatic effects; different variants can affect the same genes or pathways in different individuals; and some variants are related to each other not by affecting the same gene but by affecting the binding of the same upstream regulator. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel analysis framework that considers convergent impacts of different genetic variants on protein binding, which provides multi-scale information about disease-associated perturbations of regulatory elements, genes, and pathways. Applying it to our whole-genome sequencing data of 918 short-segment Hirschsprung disease patients and matched controls, we identify various novel genes not detected by standard single-variant and region-based tests, functionally centering on neural crest migration and development. Our framework also identifies upstream regulators whose binding is influenced by the noncoding variants.

It is now known that half of the human genome is recognizably derived from TEs. It is thus important to understand the scope and nature of their contribution to gene regulation. Here, we provide a timeline of major discoveries in this area and discuss how transposons have revolutionized our understanding of mammalian genomes, with a special emphasis on the massive contribution of TEs to primate evolution. Our analysis of primate-specific functional elements supports a simple model for the rate at which new functional elements arise in unique and TE-derived DNA.

We examine the contributions of an individual regulator, the ferrous iron-responsive regulatory element, BqsR, on global patterns of gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The position weight matrix (PWM) derived for BqsR uncovered hundreds of likely binding sites throughout the genome. Only a subset of these potential binding sites had a regulatory consequence, suggesting that BqsR/DNA interactions were not captured within the PWM or that the broader regulatory context at each promoter played a greater role in setting promoter outputs. The architecture of the BqsR operator was systematically varied to understand how binding site parameters influence expression. We found that BqsR operator affinity was predicted by the PWM well. At many promoters the surrounding regulatory context, including overlapping operators of BqsR or the presence of RhlR binding sites, were influential in setting promoter outputs. These results indicate more comprehensive models that include local regulatory contexts are needed to develop a predictive understanding of global regulatory outputs. "

Sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1a and -1c are transcribed from the same gene by the use of alternate promoters, and only differ at their first exon. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c is hypothesized to be an important regulator of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in the lactating dairy cow. However, the bovine SREBP-1c promoter has not been previously characterized, and studies to date that have investigated the role of SREBP-1 in the bovine mammary gland have not distinguished between isoforms 1a and 1c. The purpose of this study was to characterize the bovine SREBP-1c promoter and to investigate the DNA elements involved in the regulation of SREBP-1c expression by the liver X receptor agonist T0901317 in 2 different bovine mammary epithelial cell lines. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the wild-type SREBP-1c promoter or constructs with mutated liver X receptor response elements or sterol response element were transfected into MacT cells and bovine mammary epithelial (BME-UV) cells. We have demonstrated that the liver X receptor response elements sites in the SREBP-1c promoter are necessary for mediating the T0901317 response, and that stimulation through the sterol response element site plays only a minor role in this pathway. This report describes the bovine SREBP-1c promoter and its regulation by liver X receptor in bovine mammary epithelial cells."

In addition, the potential mechanisms by which carbenoxolone could exert such protection were elucidated. Carbenoxolone was daily administrated by gavage for 28 days in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Carbenoxolone prevented the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation associated with the reduction of the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, liver X receptor, fatty acid synthase and acethyl-CoA carboxylase in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Carbenoxolone also prevented hepatic injury through anti-apoptotic action in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice, accompanied by increased Bcl-2 expression and suppressed Bax and cytochrome c expression. As a mechanism, increased inflammatory cytokine expressions were inhibited by carbenoxolone in the fatty livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Furthermore, carbenoxolone inhibited free fatty acid (oleate/palmitate) induced reactive oxygen species formation and reversed free fatty acid induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization in HepG2 cells. Carbenoxolone prevents the development of fatty liver by inhibiting sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c expression and activity with an anti-apoptotic mechanism via the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species formation in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. It is suggested that carbenoxolone prevents the development and progression of fatty liver disease in patients with insulin resistance."

Results for ginsenoside F2 were compared with finasteride. DHT inhibits proliferation of hair cells and induces androgenetic alopecia and was shown to activate an apoptosis signal pathway both in vitro and in vivo. The cell-based 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that the proliferation rates of DHT-treated human hair dermal papilla cells (HHDPCs) and HaCaTs increased by 48% in the ginsenoside F2-treated group and by 12% in the finasteride-treated group. Western blot analysis showed that ginsenoside F2 decreased expression of TGF-β2 related factors involved in hair loss. The present study suggested a hair loss related pathway by changing SCAP related apoptosis pathway, which has been known to control cholesterol metabolism. SCAP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and caspase-12 expression in the ginsenoside F2-treated group were decreased compared to the DHT and finasteride-treated group. C57BL/6 mice were also prepared by injection with DHT and then treated with ginsenoside F2 or finasteride. Hair growth rate, density, thickness measurements and tissue histotological analysis in these groups suggested that ginsenoside F2 suppressed hair cell apoptosis and premature entry to catagen more effectively than finasteride. Our results indicated that ginsenoside F2 decreased the expression of TGF-β2 and SCAP proteins, which have been suggested to be involved in apoptosis and entry into catagen. This study provides evidence those factors in the SCAP pathway could be targets for hair loss prevention drugs. "

Nine SSR markers amplified rye-specific fragments whose sizes ranged from 471 bp to 1089 bp. These fragments contain regulatory elements and (or) promoters. Some of these fragments were amplified from all 24 progenies, while others were amplified from a subset of the progenies. The disappearance of rye-specific fragments from some progenies was caused by sequence elimination or DNA modification. Marker Xgwm320 amplified a new fragment (403 bp), a rye-specific tandem repeat, from some of the progenies. Twenty-eight SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in progenies derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'Jinzhou-heimai', but none of the 150 SSR markers displayed microsatellite variation in the progenies derived from the other three combinations. FISH signals of pSc200 were eliminated from one telomere/subtelomere of 4 chromosomes of 'Kustro' during allopolyploidization and expanded in amphiploids derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'AR106BONE'. Thus, allopolyploidization in wheat-rye can be accompanied by rapid variation of tandem repeats, regulatory elements, and promoter regions. The alterations of repetitive sequence pSc200 indicate coordination between the constituent genomes of the newly formed amphiploids. Different genetic backgrounds of parents appear to affect genome changes during allopolyploidization."

Several studies have shown that the OCA2 locus is the major contributor to the human eye color variation. By linkage analysis of a large Danish family, we finemapped the blue eye color locus to a 166 Kbp region within the HERC2 gene. By association analyses, we identified two SNPs within this region that were perfectly associated with the blue and brown eye colors: rs12913832 and rs1129038. Of these, rs12913832 is located 21.152 bp upstream from the OCA2 promoter in a highly conserved sequence in intron 86 of HERC2. The brown eye color allele of rs12913832 is highly conserved throughout a number of species. As shown by a Luciferase assays in cell cultures, the element significantly reduces the activity of the OCA2 promoter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the two alleles bind different subsets of nuclear extracts. One single haplotype, represented by six polymorphic SNPs covering half of the 3' end of the HERC2 gene, was found in 155 blue-eyed individuals from Denmark, and in 5 and 2 blue-eyed individuals from Turkey and Jordan, respectively. Hence, our data suggest a common founder mutation in an OCA2 inhibiting regulatory element as the cause of blue eye color in humans. In addition, an LOD score of Z = 4.21 between hair color and D14S72 was obtained in the large family, indicating that RABGGTA is a candidate gene for hair color."

Consistent with a large demand for lipids, tumor cells express high levels of lipogenic enzymes, most of which are transcriptional targets of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). However, the expression levels and the function of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer are largely unknown. Our study aimed to assess the oncogenic potential of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer. In this study, we showed that the SREBP1 protein expression was significantly higher in human ovarian cancer compared to benign and borderline ovarian tumors by immunohistochemical staining. Knockdown of SREBP1 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in ovarian cancer cells retarded cell growth, migration and invasion and enhanced cell apoptosis without significant effects on cell cycle distribution. In a xenograft SCID mouse model, SREBP1 silencing inhibited tumor growth in vivo and reduced the expression of SREBP1 downstream lipogenic genes at both the protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrate a crucial role of SREBP1 in ovarian cancer growth, which establish SREBP1 as a novel therapeutic target for antitumor therapy."

Identifying variants is becoming routine, but assessing their impact on regulation remains challenging. Bioinformatics approaches that identify variations functionally altering transcription factor (TF) binding are increasingly important for meeting this challenge. We present the current state of computational tools and resources for identifying the genomic regulatory components (cis-regulatory regions and TF binding sites, TFBSs) controlling gene transcriptional regulation. We review how such approaches can be used to interpret the potential disease causality of point mutations and small insertions or deletions. We hope this will motivate further the development of methods enabling the identification of etiological cis-regulatory variations. "

The antimicrobial peptide hepcidin displays a crucial role in innate immunity in fish against invading pathogens. It is known that the transcription of hepcidin in mammals is individually regulated by many stimuli, including inflammation, iron overload, anemia or hypoxia, through several distinct molecular pathways. The canonical mechanism for endocrine disrupting effects is mediated by an estrogen receptor (ER) and estrogen responsive element (ERE), whereas the underlying mechanism for immunotoxic effect is still unclear. In this study, a hepcidin from Oryzias melastigma (OM-hep1) was found to be down-regulated upon EE2 exposure and was associated with ERα. Unlike the revealed signaling pathways for hepcidin regulation in mammals, it was revealed by promoter activity analysis that the OM-hep1 transcription was not associated with canonical immune-associated and hormone-associated regulatory elements, known as the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), ERE and estrogen-related receptor responsive element (ERRE). Further analysis through a series of base mutations revealed a short fragment from -315 to -289 bp on the OM-hep1 promoter with high activity. This fragment was composed of a putative ERE-like element (23 bases) plus an adjacent down-streamed four bases motif GTGT. Replacement of either of the core bases (GGTCA) of ERE-like or GTGT motif showed non-activity and non-response to EE2 exposure, thus a new hepcidin-associated element named as HepERE was revealed. Evidences from electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay demonstrated that the EE2-mediated down-regulation of OM-hep1 expression was associated with ERα binding to HepERE but not classical ERE. Taken together, a novel signaling pathway was revealed and the regulatory mechanism associated with the ERα and HepERE element on immunomodulation of OM-hep1 expression upon EE2 exposure was first reported here."

However, the effects of luteolin on human placental choriocarcinoma are not known. Results of the present study revealed that luteolin decreased viability of JAR and JEG-3 cells, which are valuable placental models, in a dose-dependent manner, and it induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in JAR and JEG-3 cells. The results also suggested that the PI3K/AKT pathway was inhibited by luteolin treatment of JAR and JEG-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Next, we established effects of luteolin in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2 MAPK, and mTOR on proliferation of JAR and JEG-3 cells. In addition, these inhibitors were used to verify phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3beta, and ERK1/2 and to confirm mechanisms regulated by luteolin in JAR and JEG-3 cells. We also determined levels of SREBP1 and SREBP2 expression to investigate regulatory functions of luteolin in lipid metabolism in JAR and JEG-3 cells. Expression levels of both SREBP1 and SREBP2 mRNAs were significantly reduced, but only SREBP1 protein was influenced by luteolin. We compared viability of JAR and JEG-3 cells in response to luteolin alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs (etoposide, cisplatin, and paclitaxel) and found that luteolin has synergistic effects with the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs as an anticancer agent. Collectively, these results showed that luteolin plays an important role in the treatment of human choriocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/SREBP cascade and expression of lipogenic genes."

The regulatory mechanism that configures the transcriptome of rice during anaerobic germination is yet to be established. In this study, the major regulatory modules among anoxia-responsive genes in rice identified from published microarray data were predicted by ab initio analysis of cis-regulatory information content. Statistically overrepresented sequence motifs were detected from bona fide promoter sequences [-1000 to +200], revealing various patterns of cis-element enrichment that are highly correlated with bZIP, ERF and MYB types of transcription factors. As implied by the cis-element enrichment patterns, combinatorial mechanisms configure the overall changes in gene expression during anoxic germination and coleoptile elongation. High enrichment of cis-elements associated with ARF, bZIP, ERF, MYB and WRKY (SUSIBA2) transcription factors was also detected among the glycolytic and fermentative associated genes that were upregulated during anoxia. The patterns established from the global analysis of cis-element distribution for upregulated and downregulated genes and their associations with potential cognate regulatory transcription factors indicate the significant roles of ethylene and abscisic acid mediated signaling during coleoptile elongation under anoxia. In addition, the regulation of genes encoding enzymes in the glycolytic and fermentative metabolism could be associated with abscisic acid and auxin in rice coleoptiles to maintain sugar and ATP levels for longer survival."

Rats were fed with high fructose diet for 8 weeks to establish the NAFLD model, then were given oxymatrine treatment (40, 80, and 160 mg/kg, respectively) for another 8 weeks. Body weight gain, liver index, serum and liver lipids, and histopathological evaluation were measured. Enzymatic activity and gene expression of the key enzymes involved in the lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation were assayed. The results showed that oxymatrine treatment reduced body weight gain, liver weight, liver index, dyslipidemia, and liver triglyceride level in a dose dependant manner. Importantly, the histopathological examination of liver confirmed that oxymatrine could decrease the liver lipid accumulation. The treatment also decreased the fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzymatic activity and increased the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) enzymatic activity. Besides, oxymatrine treatment decreased the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1(Srebf1), fatty acid synthase (Fasn), and acetyl CoA carboxylase (Acc), and increased the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (Pparα), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a), and acyl CoA oxidase (Acox1) in high fructose diet induced NAFLD rats. These results suggested that the therapeutic effect of oxymatrine on the hepatic steatosis in high fructose diet induced fatty liver rats is partly due to down-regulating Srebf1 and up-regulating Pparα mediated metabolic pathways simultaneously."

The promoters of elovl5 elongase, which catalyses the rate-limiting reaction of elongating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), have been previously described and characterized from several marine and diadromous teleost species. We report here the cloning and characterization of elovl5 promoter from two freshwater fish species, the carnivorous snakehead fish (Channa striata) and zebrafish. Results show the presence of sterol-responsive elements (SRE) in the core regulatory region of both promoters, suggesting the importance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp) in the regulation of elovl5 for both species. Mutagenesis luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays further validate the role of SRE for basal transcriptional activation. In addition, several Sp1-binding sites located in close proximity with SRE were present in the snakehead promoter, with one having a potential synergy with SRE in the regulation of elovl5 expression.

Additionally, control of the disease is further complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains due to the extensive use of triazole antifungal drugs. In this work, an orthologus gene encoding a putative sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) was identified in the genome of P. digitatum and named sreA. The putative SreA protein contains a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF2014) at its carboxyl terminus and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) leucine zipper DNA binding domain at its amino terminus, domains that are functionally associated with SREBP transcription factors. The deletion of sreA (ΔsreA) in a prochloraz-resistant strain (PdHS-F6) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation led to increased susceptibility to prochloraz and a significantly lower EC50 value compared with the HS-F6 wild-type or complementation strain (COsreA). A virulence assay showed that the ΔsreA strain was defective in virulence towards citrus fruits, while the complementation of sreA could restore the virulence to a large extent. Further analysis by quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that prochloraz-induced expression of cyp51A and cyp51B in PdHS-F6 was completely abolished in the ΔsreA strain. These results demonstrate that sreA is a critical transcription factor gene required for prochloraz resistance and full virulence in P. digitatum and is involved in the regulation of cyp51 expression.

This effect is mediated in part by the transcriptional regulator sterol responsive element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which stimulates the expression of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. SREBP-1c is up regulated by insulin both via increased transcription of nascent full-length SREBP-1c and by enhanced proteolytic processing of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound precursor to yield the transcriptionally active n-terminal form, nSREBP-1c. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin (n-3 PUFA) prevent induction of SREBP-1c by insulin thereby reducing plasma and hepatic triglycerides. Despite widespread use of n-3 PUFA supplements to reduce triglycerides in clinical practice, the exact mechanisms underlying their hypotriglyceridemic effect remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:5 n-3) reduces nSREBP-1c by inhibiting regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of the nascent SREBP-1c. We further show that this effect of DHA is mediated both via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and by inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The inhibitory effect of AMPK on SREBP-1c processing is linked to phosphorylation of serine 365 of SREBP-1c in the rat. We have defined a novel regulatory mechanism by which n-3 PUFA inhibit induction of SREBP-1c by insulin. These findings identify AMPK as an important negative regulator of hepatic lipid synthesis and as a potential therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia in obesity and T2DM. "

The profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) plays a central role in the development of glomerular sclerosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 is an important regulator of glomerular sclerosis through both induction of TGF-β1 as well as facilitation of its signaling. Here we have identified that SREBP-1 is also a novel regulator of TGF-β receptor I (TβRI) expression in kidney mesangial cells. Inhibition of SREBP activation with fatostatin or downregulation of SREBP-1 using siRNA inhibited the expression of the receptor. SREBP-1 did not regulate TβRI transcription, nor did it induce its proteasomal or lysosomal degradation or proteolytic cleavage. Disruption of lipid rafts with cyclodextrin, however, prevented TβRI downregulation. This was not dependent on caveolae since SREBP-1 inhibition could induce TβRI downregulation in caveolin-1 knockout mesangial cells. SREBP-1 associated with TβRI, and SREBP-1 inhibition led to the secretion of TβRI in exosomes. Thus, we have identified a novel role for SREBP-1 as a cell surface retention factor for TβRI in mesangial cells, preventing its secretion in exosomes. Inhibition of SREBP-1 in vivo may thus provide a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy which targets multiple aspects of TGFβ signaling and matrix upregulation."

However, the mechanisms regulating ABO gene expression in epithelial cells remain obscure. On the basis of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in and around ABO in epithelial cells, we prepared reporter plasmid constructs including these sites. Subsequent luciferase assays and histone modifications indicated a novel positive regulatory element, designated the +22.6-kb site, downstream from ABO, and this was shown to enhance ABO promoter activity in an epithelial cell-specific manner. Expression of ABO and B-antigen was reduced in gastric cancer KATOIII cells by biallelic deletion of the +22.6-kb site using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the site bound to an epithelial cell-specific transcription factor, Elf5. Mutation of the Ets binding motifs to abrogate binding of this factor reduced the regulatory activity of the +22.6-kb site. Furthermore, ELF5 knockdown with shRNA reduced both endogenous transcription from ABO and B-antigen expression in KATOIII cells. Thus, Elf5 appeared to be involved in the enhancer potential of the +22.6-kb site.

The major phosphorylation sites of p38, i.e. serine 39 and threonine 402, are identical to those we recently identified in the splice-variant SREBP-1a. In contrast, ERK and JNK phosphorylate SREBP-1c at two major sites, i.e. threonine 81 and serine 93, instead of one site in SREBP-1a. Functional analyses of the biological outcome in the human liver cell line HepG2 reveals SREBP-1c phosphorylation dependent alteration in lipid metabolism and secretion pattern of lipid transporting proteins, e.g. ApoE or ApoA1.

The sea urchin embryo offers an unparalleled platform for understanding this process because of the ease with which its skeletogenic mesenchyme cells can be manipulated. In this study, preliminary evidence from biochemical studies towards understanding the role of the Onecut transcription factor during sea urchin skeletogenic mesenchyme cell specification is presented. Based on the evidence, an empirical model is proposed showing how Onecut, together with associated co-factors, may be using the C-element of the SM50 gene regulatory region in advance of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus spicule development. In the model, Onecut recognizes and binds the DNA sequence CATCGATCTC in the C-element without temporal restriction. Onecut then utilizes different sets of co-factors to switch from its unknown function early in development (four cell stage to the mesenchyme blastula stage), to its known role in the oral-aboral boundary thereafter. At the writing of this report, definitive evidence as to whether the ""early"" factors are expressed in all cells except the micromere lineages, or whether the ""late"" factors are expressed in micromere descendants or ectodermal precursors only are lacking. The former would suggest a possible Onecut repression function for the early co-factors outside the micromere lineages; the latter scenario would suggest a Onecut activation function for the late co-factors in the presumptive ciliary band."

Mice with or without whole-body deletion of perilipin-2 (Plin2-null) were fed either Western or control diets for 30 weeks. Perilipin-2 deletion prevents obesity and insulin resistance in Western diet-fed mice and dramatically reduces hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels in mice fed Western or control diets. Gene and protein expression studies reveal that PLIN2 deletion suppressed SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 target genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways in livers of mice on either diet. GC-MS lipidomics demonstrate that this reduction correlated with profound alterations in the hepatic lipidome with significant reductions in both desaturation and elongation of hepatic neutral lipid species. To examine the possibility that lipidomic actions of PLIN2 deletion contribute to suppression of SREBP activation, we isolated endoplasmic reticulum membrane fractions from long-term Western diet-fed wild type (WT) and Plin2-null mice. Lipidomic analyses reveal that endoplasmic reticulum membranes from Plin2-null mice are markedly enriched in ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which others have shown inhibit SREBP activation and de novo lipogenesis. Our results identify PLIN2 as a determinant of global changes in the hepatic lipidome and suggest the hypothesis that these actions contribute to SREBP-regulated de novo lipogenesis involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."

In the present study, we show that loss of SREBP-1a also results in an increase in apoptosis after exposure to bacterial pore-forming toxins and we show this is a result of a selective reduction in the expression of the gene coding for the antiapoptotic factor apoptosis inhibitor 6 (Api6).

Increased SREBP-1c level and activity contribute to excessive hepatic triglyceride accumulation in NAFLD patients; however, negative regulators of Srebp-1c are not well defined. In this study, we show that Dec1, a critical regulator of circadian rhythm, negatively regulates hepatic Srebp-1c expression. Hepatic Dec1 expression levels are markedly decreased in NAFLD mouse models. Restored Dec1 gene expression levels in NAFLD mouse livers decreased the expression of Srebp-1c and lipogenic genes, subsequently ameliorating the fatty liver phenotype. Conversely, knockdown of Dec1 expression by an adenovirus expressing Dec1-specific shRNA led to an increase in hepatic TG content in normal mouse livers. Correspondingly, expression levels of lipogenic genes, including Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc, were increased in livers of mice with Dec1 knockdown. Moreover, a functional lipogenesis assay suggested that Dec1 overexpression repressed lipid synthesis in primary hepatocytes. Finally, a luciferase reporter gene assay indicates that DEC1 inhibits Srebp-1c gene transcription via the E-box mapped to the promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that DEC1 proteins bound to the identified E-box element. Our studies indicate that DEC1 is an important regulator of Srebp-1c expression and links circadian rhythm to hepatic lipogenesis.

However, the detailed mechanism of glucose's effect on cartilage repair remains unclear. Chitosan, a naturally derived polysaccharide, has recently been investigated as a surgical or dental dressing to control breeding. Therefore, in this study, glucose was adsorbed to chitosan membranes (CTS-Glc), and the study aimed to investigate whether CTS-Glc complex membranes could regulate the proliferation of human OA chondrocytes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Human OA and SW1353 chondrocytes were used in this study. The experiments involving the transfection of cells used SW1353 chondrocytes. A specific inhibitor and siRNAs were used to investigate the mechanism underlying the CTS-Glc-regulated proliferation of human chondrocytes. We found that CTS-Glc significantly increased the proliferation of both human OA and SW1353 chondrocytes comparable to glucose- or chitosan-only stimulation. The role of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, including mTOR, raptor, and S6k proteins, has been demonstrated in the regulation of CTS-Glc-increased human chondrocyte proliferation. mTORC1 signaling increased the expression levels of maturated SREBP-1 and FASN and then induced the expressions of cell cycle regulators, that is, cyclin D, cyclin-dependent kinase-4 and -6 in human chondrocytes. This study elucidates the detailed mechanism behind the effect of CTS-Glc complex membranes in promoting chondrocyte proliferation and proposes a possible clinical application of the CTS-Glc complex in the dextrose intraarticular injection of OA prolotherapy in the future to attenuate the pain and discomfort of OA patients."

HS6, HS7 and HS8 were detected immediately upstream of the TdT promoter. HS10 and HS11 were localized in the first and third intron of the gene. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that HS1, HS2 and HS3 synergize with the TdT promoter to activate transcription in a TdT+ pre-T cell line but not in a TdT+ pro-B cell line.

Furthermore, proteins blocked SREBP precursor transport, insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) and INSIG2 proteins, as well as a protein-mediated nuclear SREBP proteolysis, F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7, decreased in mouse liver exposed to PFOA. The expression levels of the miR-183-96-182 cluster, which is possibly involved in a regulatory loop intermediated by SREBPs maturation, were also increased in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure. We also observed that PFOA induced lipid content and PPARα in Hepa 1-6 cells after exposure to PFOA for 72 h but SREBPs were not activated in vitro.

Although the role of p53 as a strong trans-activator of gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied.

During nutritional deprivation, hepatic SREBP1c is rapidly suppressed by fasting signals to prevent lipogenic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that control SREBP1c turnover in response to fasting status are not thoroughly understood. To elucidate which factors are involved in the inactivation of SREBP1c, we attempted to identify SREBP1c-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Since we observed that ring finger protein20 (RNF20) ubiquitin ligase was identified as one of SREBP1c-interacting proteins, we hypothesized that fasting signaling would promote SREBP1c degradation in an RNF20-dependent manner. In this work, we demonstrate that RNF20 physically interacts with SREBP1c, leading to degradation of SREBP1c via ubiquitination. In accordance with these findings, RNF20 represses the transcriptional activity of SREBP1c and turns off the expression of lipogenic genes that are targets of SREBP1c. In contrast, knockdown of RNF20 stimulates the expression of SREBP1c and lipogenic genes and induces lipogenic activity in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) with glucagon or forskolin enhances the expression of RNF20 and potentiates the ubiquitination of SREBP1c via RNF20. In wild-type and db/db mice, adenoviral overexpression of RNF20 markedly suppresses FASN promoter activity and reduces the level of hepatic triglycerides, accompanied by a decrease in the hepatic lipogenic program. Here, we reveal that RNF20-induced SREBP1c ubiquitination down-regulates hepatic lipogenic activity upon PKA activation."

Leptin-induced Stat3 activation was, at least partially, ERK pathway-dependent in cultured HSCs and was correlated positively with β-catenin activity and negatively with liver X receptor α expression and activity which influenced SREBP-1c expression in HSCs. The decrease in SREBP-1c expression by leptin-induced Stat3 pathway led to the increase in the marker for HSC activation and in α1(I) collagen expression in HSCs. In summary, the effect of leptin-induced Stat3 pathway on SREBP-1c expression in HSCs might contribute to the role of leptin in liver fibrosis in mouse, thus advancing understanding of the mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis associated with leptin."

Although a lot of research has been conducted, the regulation of cholesterol metabolism is still largely unknown. Some miRNAs have been found to play critical role in the cholesterol metabolism. MiR-98 is a miRNA whose function has been reported mainly in tumorigenesis. In this study, we elucidate a novel role of miR-98 in cholesterol metabolism. We found that the expression of miR-98 was decreased significantly in hypercholesterolemic patients compared with healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we identified that SREBP-2, an important transcriptional factor in cholesterol metabolism, was a direct target of miR-98. Overexpression of miR-98 significantly repressed the 3'-UTR reporter activities of SREBP-2 in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells, while the effect of miR-98 was blocked when the binding site of miR-98 within the SREBP-2 3'-UTR was mutated. And overexpression of miR-98 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of HMGCR and LDLR significantly in vitro, which are two target genes of SREBP-2. Furthermore, MiR-98 overexpression reduced the intracellular total cholesterol levels dramatically. Moreover, we overexpressed the miR-98 by lentiviral tail vein injection in vivo. Compared with the control mice, the miR-98 overexpression mice showed lower serum cholesterol level and decreased SREBP-2, HMGCR as well as LDLR expression. Our data confirmed that reduced expression of miR-98 potentially contributes to disturbance of cholesterol metabolism. MiR-98 might be a novel therapeutic target to hypercholesterolemia."

Previous research found that mutations in MBTPS2, encoding site-2-protease (S2P), underlie X-linked IFAP syndrome. The present report describes the identification via whole-exome sequencing of three heterozygous mutations in SREBF1 in 11 unrelated, ethnically diverse individuals with autosomal-dominant IFAP syndrome. SREBF1 encodes sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), which promotes the transcription of lipogenes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterols. This process requires cleavage of SREBP1 by site-1-protease (S1P) and S2P and subsequent translocation into the nucleus where it binds to sterol regulatory elements (SRE). The three detected SREBF1 mutations caused substitution or deletion of residues 527, 528, and 530, which are crucial for S1P cleavage. In vitro investigation of SREBP1 variants demonstrated impaired S1P cleavage, which prohibited nuclear translocation of the transcriptionally active form of SREBP1. As a result, SREBP1 variants exhibited significantly lower transcriptional activity compared to the wild-type, as demonstrated via luciferase reporter assay. RNA sequencing of the scalp skin from IFAP-affected individuals revealed a dramatic reduction in transcript levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and of keratin genes known to be expressed in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. An increased rate of in situ keratinocyte apoptosis, which might contribute to skin hyperkeratosis and hypotrichosis, was also detected in scalp samples from affected individuals. Together with previous research, the present findings suggest that SREBP signaling plays an essential role in epidermal differentiation, skin barrier formation, hair growth, and eye function."
23102957,,Regulation of lipid synthesis by liver X receptor α and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in mammary epithelial cells.,2012,J Dairy Sci,10.3168/jds.2011-5276,"['C Oppi-Williams', 'J K Suagee', 'B A Corl']",[],"The objectives of this experiment were to characterize the roles of the transcription factors liver X receptor α (LXRα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) in the transcriptional regulation of lipid synthesis in a bovine mammary epithelial cell line. Whereas many lipid synthesis genes contain a response element in their promoters for SREBP1, a few also contain a response element for LXR, suggesting that both transcription factors could directly regulate transcription of these genes. However, the promoter of SREBP1 contains a response element for LXR, indicating the additional potential for indirect transcriptional regulation by LXR, through SREBP1, on lipogenic genes. To characterize these effects, small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against LXRα and SREBP1 were used to knockdown gene expression, and then, in the presence of SREBP1 siRNA, T 4506585 (T09) was used to specifically activate LXRα. Reducing LXRα mRNA abundance in mammary alveolar T cells did not alter mRNA abundance of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis or the rate of de novo lipogenesis, suggesting that LXRα is not required for basal transcription of genes required for fatty acid synthesis. Knockdown of SREBP1 reduced the mRNA abundance of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, indicating that these genes are regulated in part by SREBP1. When SREBP1 was reduced, T09 increased the mRNA abundance of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase, potentially indicating that these genes are directly regulated by LXR. The results of the present study provide insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in lipid synthesis by mammary epithelial cells, and suggest that several transcription factors may be required for full lipogenic activation."

This element is located in a putative hairpin loop structure, within the first 101 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. The binding of hnRNPC1/C2 is strongly enhanced in response to the DNA-damaging drug cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] and the cytostatic transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (dactinomycin), both known inducers of apoptosis and p53. Strongly stimulated binding is observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, and it is accompanied by a cytoplasmic increase of hnRNPC1/C2. Changes in hnRNPC1/C2 protein levels are not proportional to binding activity, suggesting qualitative changes in hnRNPC1/C2 upon activation. Phosphorylation studies reveal contrasting characteristics of the cytoplasmic and nuclear hnRNPC1/C2 interaction with p53 mRNA. Results from chimeric p53-luciferase reporter constructs suggest that hnRNPC1/C2 regulates p53 expression via this binding site. Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which the interaction of hnRNPC1/C2 with a cis-element within the coding region of the p53 transcript regulates the expression of p53 mRNA before and during apoptosis. In addition, we report that preapoptotic signals induced by transcriptional inhibition trigger the appearance of a truncated, exclusively cytoplasmic 43-kDa variant of p53 before apoptosis."

To identify the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect, the mouse Pdx-1 gene promoter (2.7 kb) was analyzed in β cell and non-β cell lines. Despite no apparent sterol regulatory element-binding protein-binding sites, the Pdx-1 promoter was suppressed by SREBP-1c in β cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDX-1 activated its own promoter. The E-box (-104/-99 bp) in the proximal region, occupied by ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), was crucial for the PDX-1-positive autoregulatory loop through direct PDX-1·USF binding. This positive feedback activation was a prerequisite for SREBP-1c suppression of the promoter in non-β cells. SREBP-1c and PDX-1 directly interact through basic helix-loop-helix and homeobox domains, respectively. This robust SREBP-1c·PDX-1 complex interferes with PDX-1·USF formation and inhibits the recruitment of PDX-1 coactivators. SREBP-1c also inhibits PDX-1 binding to the previously described PDX-1-binding site (-2721/-2646 bp) in the distal enhancer region of the Pdx-1 promoter. Endogenous up-regulation of SREBP-1c in INS-1 cells through the activation of liver X receptor and retinoid X receptor by 9-cis-retinoic acid and 22-hydroxycholesterol inhibited PDX-1 mRNA and protein expression. Conversely, SREBP-1c RNAi restored Pdx-1 mRNA and protein levels. Through these multiple mechanisms, SREBP-1c, when induced in a lipotoxic state, repressed PDX-1 expression contributing to the inhibition of insulin expression and β cell dysfunction."

Primates, but not rodents, express miR-33b from an intron of SREBF1. Therefore, humanized mice, in which a miR-33b transgene is inserted within a Srebf1 intron, are required to address its function in vivo. We successfully established miR-33b knock-in (KI) mice and found that protein levels of known miR-33a target genes, such as ABCA1, ABCG1, and SREBP-1, were reduced compared with those in wild-type mice. As a consequence, macrophages from the miR-33b KI mice had a reduced cholesterol efflux capacity via apoA-I and HDL-C. Moreover, HDL-C levels were reduced by almost 35% even in miR-33b KI hetero mice compared with the control mice. These results indicate that miR-33b may account for lower HDL-C levels in humans than those in mice and that miR-33b is possibly utilized for a feedback mechanism to regulate its host gene SREBF1. Our mice will also aid in elucidating the roles of miR-33a/b in different genetic disease models. "

We observed here that NGF and its pro-form, pro-NGF, are elevated in fatty livers from leptin-deficient mice compared with controls, concomitant with an increase in low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). Stimulation of mouse primary hepatocytes with NGF or pro-NGF increased LDLR expression through the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Studies using Huh7 human hepatocyte cells showed that the neurotrophins activate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) that regulates genes involved in lipid metabolism. The mechanisms for this were related to stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and activation of caspase-3 and SREBP2 cleavage following NGF and pro-NGF stimulations. Cell fractionation experiments showed that caspase-3 activity was increased particularly in the membrane fraction that harbors SREBP2 and caspase-2. Experiments showed further that caspase-2 interacts with pro-caspase-3 and that p38 MAPK reduced this interaction and caused caspase-3 activation. Because of the increased caspase-3 activity, the cells did not undergo cell death following p75NTR stimulation, possibly due to concomitant activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway by the neurotrophins. These results identify a novel signaling pathway triggered by ligand-activated p75NTR that via p38 MAPK and caspase-3 mediate the activation of SREBP2. This pathway may regulate LDLRs and lipid uptake particularly after injury or during tissue inflammation accompanied by an increased production of growth factors, including NGF and pro-NGF. "

In this study, we investigated the functional roles of 5.5URR in the transcriptional regulation of STAT1 gene. A chromosome conformation capture assay indicated physical interaction of 5.5URR with the STAT1 core promoter. In luciferase reporter assays, 5.5URR-combined STAT1 core promoter exhibited significant increase in reporter activity enhanced by forced STAT1 expression or interferon (IFN) treatment, but STAT1 core promoter alone did not. The 5.5URR contained IFN-stimulated response element and GAS sites, which bound STAT1 complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of HEK293 cells with Halo-tagged STAT1 expression indicated the association of Halo-tagged STAT1 with 5.5URR. ChIP assays with IFN treatment demonstrated that IFNs promoted the recruitment of Halo-tagged STAT1 to 5.5URR. Forced STAT1 expression or IFN treatment increased the expression of endogenous STAT1 and other IFN signaling pathway components, such as STAT2, IRF9 and IRF1, besides IFN-responsive genes. Collectively, the results suggest that 5.5URR may provide a regulatory platform for positive feedback control of STAT1 expression possibly to amplify or sustain the intracellular IFN signals. "

With the recent explosion of genome-wide comparisons of the cis-regulatory content in different animal species is now possible to infer general principles underlying enhancer evolution. However, these studies have also revealed numerous discrepancies and paradoxes, suggesting that the mechanistic causes and modes of cis-regulatory evolution are still not well understood and are probably much more complex than generally appreciated. Here, we argue that the mutational mechanisms and genomic regions generating new regulatory activities must comply with the constraints imposed by the molecular properties of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and the organizational features of long-range chromatin interactions. Accordingly, we propose a new integrative evolutionary framework for cis-regulatory evolution based on two major premises for the origin of novel enhancer activity: (i) an accessible chromatin environment and (ii) compatibility with the 3D structure and interactions of pre-existing CREs. Mechanisms and DNA sequences not fulfilling these premises, will be less likely to have a measurable impact on gene expression and as such, will have a minor contribution to the evolution of gene regulation. Finally, we discuss current comparative cis-regulatory data under the light of this new evolutionary model, and propose that the two most prominent mechanisms for the evolution of cis-regulatory changes are the overprinting of ancestral CREs and the exaptation of transposable elements."

These differences include the positioning of the CpxR regulatory element relative to the promoter element, and the effect of CpxR phosphate donors on the expression of CpxR target genes. In addition, unlike most response regulators, a mutant form of the L. pneumophila CpxR which cannot be phosphorylated was found to self-interact, and to repress gene expression similarly to wild-type CpxR, even though its ability to activate gene expression was reduced. Moreover, the CpxRA TCS was found to activate the expression of LetE which was found to function as a connector protein between the CpxRA TCS and the LetAS-RsmYZ-CsrA regulatory cascade. Our results show that CpxR plays a major role in L. pneumophila pathogenesis gene expression and functions as part of a regulatory network. "

Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3'UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element-the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA-protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol beta mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol beta."

An excess of dietary cholesterol can lead to serious health problems, however, if consumption of this lipid is restricted in the diet, cells have the capacity to synthesize it. For the synthesis of cholesterol, the cell uses a family of proteins named sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP's), that are transcriptional factors involved in the control of expression of genes of cholesterol and fatty acids synthesis. SREBP's regulate gene transcription by binding to cis-acting elements denominated sterol regulatory elements (SRE-1). SREBP's are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but in the event that the cell needs to synthesize cholesterol, the NH2-terminal portion of these proteins is cleaved by two specific proteases, and then travels into the nucleus to function as transcriptional factor. The present review shows the details of the mechanism that the cell uses to regulate cholesterol biosynthesis by the SREBP's, and its potential metabolic implications."

A significant increase in BV-mediated gene expression was detected in several cell lines. A 10-fold increase in transgene expression was observed with the WPRE as determined by the percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Furthermore, a combination of optimized cell culture medium and WPRE virus led to more than a 60-fold increase in gene expression. In accordance, elevated mRNA and protein levels were detected in WPRE-virus transduced cells. In HepG2 and RaaSMC, WPRE-mediated enhancement was comparable to the previously shown positive effect of sodium butyrate on BV-mediated gene expression.

In vitro assays suggest that this motif is recognized by members of the basic region-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factor family, USF1 and USF2, and reporter assays indicate that this novel E-box is involved in mediating PTEN transcriptional activation. Four of 30 CS/CS-like patients, without previously identified PTEN mutations, were found with germline deletions of the E-box element. Of the four, three had deletions stretching to exon 1, but not 3' of it; importantly, one classic CS patient harbored a germline deletion localizing to this E-box region, further affirming the role of this element in PTEN's regulation and deregulation, and its contribution to the pathogenesis of CS."

Consistent with other invertebrates, we identified a single SREBP ortholog in Penaeus vannamei (designated PvSREBP) with transcripts ubiquitously expressed in tissues and induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Streptococcus iniae. In vivo RNA interference (RNAi) of PvSREBP attenuated the expression of several fatty acid metabolism-related genes (i.e., cyclooxygenase (PvCOX), lipoxygenase (PvLOX), fatty acid binding protein (PvFABP) and fatty acid synthase (PvFASN)), which consequently decreased the levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (ΣPUFAs). In addition, PvSREBP silencing decreased transcript levels of several immune-related genes such as hemocyanin (PvHMC) and trypsin (PvTrypsin), as well as genes encoding for heat-shock proteins (i.e., PvHSP60, PvHSP70 and PvHSP90). Moreover, in silico analysis revealed the presence of SREBP binding motifs on the promoters of most of the dysregulated genes, while shrimp depleted of PvSREBP were more susceptible to V. parahaemolyticus infection. Collectively, we demonstrated the involvement of shrimp SREBP in fatty acids metabolism and immune response, and propose that PvSREBP and PvHMC modulate each other through a feedback mechanism to establish homeostasis. The current study is the first to show the dual role of SREBP in fatty acid metabolism and immune response in invertebrates and crustaceans."

In this paper, we have found that the yellow sequence from -100 to -69 is essential for stimulation of the heterologous eve (TATA-containing) and white (TATA-less) promoters by the yellow enhancers from a distance. However, the presence of this sequence is not required when the yellow enhancers are directly fused to the heterologous promoters or are activated by the yeast GAL4 activator. Unexpectedly, the same promoter proximal region defines previously described promoter-specific, long-distance repression of the yellow promoter by the gypsy insulator on the mod(mdg4) ( u1 ) background. These finding suggest that proteins bound to the -100 to -69 sequence are essential for communication between the yellow promoter and upstream regulatory elements."

Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), when presented in its mature form (mSREBP1), enhances lipogenesis by increasing transcription of several of its target genes. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, are master regulators of cellular survival, growth and metabolism. A role for mTORC1 in the regulation of SREBP1 activity has been suggested; however, the connection between mTORC2 and SREBP1 has not been clearly established and hence is the focus of this study. mTOR kinase inhibitors (for example, INK128), which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, decreased mSREBP1 levels in various cancer cell lines. Knockdown of rictor, but not raptor, also decreased mSREBP1. Consistently, reduced mSREBP1 levels were detected in cells deficient in rictor or Sin1 compared with parent or rictor-deficient cells with re-expression of ectopic rictor. Hence it is mTORC2 inhibition that causes mSREBP1 reduction. As a result, expression of the mSREBP1 target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty-acid synthase was suppressed, along with suppressed lipogenesis in cells exposed to INK128. Moreover, mSREBP1 stability was reduced in cells treated with INK128 or rictor knockdown. Inhibition of proteasome, GSK3 or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7, prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by mTORC2 inhibition. Thus mTORC2 inhibition clearly facilitates GSK3-dependent, FBXW7-mediated mSREBP1 degradation, leading to mSREBP1 reduction. Accordingly, we conclude that mTORC2 positively regulates mSREBP1 stability and lipogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel biological function of mTORC2 in the regulation of lipogenesis and warrant further study in this direction. "

Nelfinavir and site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reduced the proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer and induced apoptosis, which was opposed by autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy with hydroxychloroquine was additive to the apoptotic effect of nelfinavir. Western blotting of S1P and S2P siRNA knockdown and/or nelfinavir-treated cells confirmed the accumulation of precursor SREBP-1 and ATF6. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, an S1P inhibitor, did not affect SREBP-1 processing. In contrast, 1,10-phenanthroline, an S2P inhibitor, reproduced the nelfinavir-treated molecular and biological phenotype. Nelfinavir-mediated inhibition of regulated intramembrane proteolysis led to the accumulation of unprocessed SREBP-1 and ATF6. This resulted in sequential endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibition of the unfolded protein response, reduced fatty acid synthase expression and apoptosis, which was countered by autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy was at least additive to this pro-apoptotic effect. These findings provide new insights into nelfinavir-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and cancer cell death, and lead us to propose investigating its clinical activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer. This report validates S2P as a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer."

Thrsp expression is known to be regulated by a variety of transcription factors, including thyroid hormone receptor, pregnane X receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor. Emerging in vitro evidence also points to a critical role of liver X receptor (LXR) in regulating Thrsp transcription in hepatocytes. In the present study, we showed that Thrsp was up-regulated in livers of db/db mice and high-fat-diet-fed mice, two models of murine NAFLD. Hepatic overexpression of Thrsp increased triglyceride accumulation with enhanced lipogenesis in livers of C57Bl/6 mice, whereas hepatic Thrsp gene silencing attenuated the fatty liver phenotype in db/db mice. LXR activator TO901317 induced Thrsp expression in livers of wild-type (WT) and LXR-β gene-deficient mice, but not in LXR-α or LXR-α/β double-knockout mice. TO901317 treatment significantly enhanced hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression and activity in WT mice, but failed to induce Thrsp expression in SREBP-1c gene-deficient mice. Sequence analysis revealed four LXR response-element-like elements and one sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding site within a -2,468 ∼+1-base-pair region of the Thrsp promoter. TO901317 treatment and LXR-α overexpression failed to induce, whereas overexpression of SREBP-1c significantly increased Thrsp promoter activity. Moreover, deletion of the SRE site completely abolished SREBP-1c-induced Thrsp transcription."

The levels of SREBP-1 are significantly elevated in obese patients and in animal models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and a vast number of studies have implicated this transcription factor as a contributor to hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. However, its role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism is poorly understood. Here we have addressed whether SREBP-1 is needed for regulating glucose homeostasis. Using RNAi and a new generation of adenoviral vector, we have silenced hepatic SREBP-1 in normal and obese mice. In normal animals, SREBP-1 deficiency increased Pck1 and reduced glycogen deposition during fed conditions, providing evidence that SREBP-1 is necessary to regulate carbohydrate metabolism during the fed state. Knocking SREBP-1 down in db/db mice resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride accumulation, as anticipated. However, mice remained hyperglycemic, which was associated with up-regulation of gluconeogenesis gene expression as well as decreased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis gene expression. Furthermore, glycogen synthase activity and glycogen accumulation were significantly reduced. In conclusion, silencing both isoforms of SREBP-1 leads to significant changes in carbohydrate metabolism and does not improve insulin resistance despite reducing steatosis in an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Rice has six oleosin genes in its genome, the expression of all of which was found to be responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) in our examination of mature embryo and aleurone tissues. The 5'-flanking region of OsOle5 was initially characterized for its responsiveness to ABA through a transient expression assay system using the protoplasts from suspension-cultured rice cells. A series of successive deletions and site-directed mutations identified five regions critical for the hormonal induction of its promoter activity. A search for cis-acting elements in these regions deposited in a public database revealed that they contain various promoter elements previously reported to be involved in the ABA response of various genes. A gain-of-function experiment indicated that multiple copies of all five regions were sufficient to provide the minimal promoter with a distinct ABA responsiveness. Comparative sequence analysis of the short, but still ABA-responsive, promoters of OsOle genes revealed no common modular architecture shared by them, indicating that various distinct promoter elements and independent trans-acting factors are involved in the ABA responsiveness of rice oleosin multigenes."

In fission yeast, SREBP functions in an oxygen-sensing pathway to promote adaptation to decreased oxygen supply that limits oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis. Low oxygen stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the SREBP homolog Sre1, generating the active transcription factor Sre1N that drives expression of sterol biosynthetic enzymes. In addition, low oxygen increases the stability and DNA binding activity of Sre1N. To identify additional signals controlling Sre1 activity, we conducted a genetic overexpression screen. Here, we describe our isolation and characterization of the casein kinase 1 family member Hhp2 as a novel regulator of Sre1N. Deletion of Hhp2 increases Sre1N protein stability and ergosterol levels in the presence of oxygen. Hhp2-dependent Sre1N degradation by the proteasome requires Hhp2 kinase activity, and Hhp2 binds and phosphorylates Sre1N at specific residues. Our results describe a role for casein kinase 1 as a direct regulator of sterol homeostasis. Given the role of mammalian Hhp2 homologs, casein kinase 1δ and 1ε, in regulation of the circadian clock, these findings may provide a mechanism for coordinating circadian rhythm and lipid metabolism.

Here, we report that conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2), a CpG-rich Foxp3 intronic cis-element specifically demethylated in mature Tregs, helps maintain immune homeostasis and limit autoimmune disease development by protecting Treg identity in response to signals that shape mature Treg functions and drive their initial differentiation. In activated Tregs, CNS2 helps protect Foxp3 expression from destabilizing cytokine conditions by sensing TCR/NFAT activation, which facilitates the interaction between CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter. Thus, epigenetically marked cis-elements can protect cell identity by sensing key environmental cues central to both cell identity formation and functional plasticity without interfering with initial cell differentiation.

We also demonstrated that human homolog of mouse double minute 2 (HDM2) acts as an E3 neddylation ligase of SREBP1c. Further, treatment with the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, attenuates high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis by reducing the levels of SREBP1c protein and hepatic triglyceride.

We examined the effects of FoxO1 on srebp1 gene expression in vivo and in vitro. In vivo studies showed that constitutively active (CA) FoxO1 (CA-FoxO1) reduced basal expression of SREBP-1c mRNA in liver by ∼60% and blunted induction of SREBP-1c in response to feeding. In liver-specific FoxO knock-out mice, SREBP-1c expression was increased ∼2-fold. Similarly, in primary hepatocytes, CA-FoxO1 suppressed SREBP1-c expression and inhibited basal and insulin-induced SREBP-1c promoter activity. SREBP-1c gene expression is induced by the liver X receptor (LXR), but CA-FoxO1 did not block the activation of SREBP-1c by the LXR agonist TO9. Insulin stimulates SREBP-1c transcription through Sp1 and via ""feed forward"" regulation by newly synthesized SREBP-1c. CA-FoxO1 inhibited SREBP-1c by reducing the transactivational capacity of both Sp1 and SREBP-1c. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that FoxO1 can associate with the proximal promoter region of the srebp1 gene and disrupt the assembly of key components of the transcriptional complex of the SREBP-1c promoter. We conclude that FoxO1 inhibits SREBP-1c transcription via combined actions on multiple transcription factors and that this effect is exerted at least in part through reduced transcriptional activity of Sp1 and SREBP-1c and disrupted assembly of the transcriptional initiation complex on the SREBP-1c promoter."

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of a lens enhancer located within a CRM that not only predates the lens, a vertebrate innovation, but bilaterian animals in general. Alignments of orthologous sequences from different deuterostomes sub-divide the CRM into a deeply conserved core and a more divergent flanking region. We demonstrate that all deuterostome flanking regions, including invertebrate sequences, activate gene expression in the zebrafish lens through the same ancient cluster of activator sites. However, levels of gene expression vary between species due to the presence of repressor motifs in flanking region and core. These repressor motifs are responsible for the relatively weak enhancer activity of tetrapod flanking regions. Ray-finned fish, however, have gained two additional lineage-specific activator motifs which in combination with the ancient cluster of activators and the core constitute a potent lens enhancer. The exploitation and modification of existing regulatory potential in flanking regions but not in the highly conserved core might represent a more general model for the emergence of novel regulatory functions in complex CRMs. "

Nuclear levels of the transcription factors that regulate lipid biogenesis, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP1 and SREBP2), were found to be decreased in HD models compared to wild-type, but the underlying causes were not known. SREBPs are synthesized as inactive endoplasmic reticulum-localized precursors. Their mature forms (mSREBPs) are generated upon transport of the SREBP precursors to the Golgi and proteolytic cleavage, and are rapidly imported into the nucleus by binding to importin β. We show that, although SREBP2 processing into mSREBP2 is not affected in YAC128 HD mice, mSREBP2 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Chimeric mSREBP2-and mSREBP1-EGFP proteins are also mislocalized to the cytoplasm in immortalized striatal cells expressing mHTT, in YAC128 neurons and in fibroblasts from HD patients. We further show that mHTT binds to the SREBP2/importin β complex required for nuclear import and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. As a result, HD cells fail to upregulate cholesterogenic genes under sterol-depleted conditions. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the downregulation of genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in HD models, and have potential implications for other pathways modulated by SREBPs, including autophagy and excitotoxicity."

We previously reported that mice with a deletion of an upstream regulatory element (URE) of the gene encoding PU.1 (Sfpi1) developed acute myeloid leukemia. Here we show that the URE has an essential role in orchestrating the dynamic PU.1 expression pattern required for lymphoid development and tumor suppression. URE deletion ablated B2 cells but stimulated growth of B1 cells in mice. The URE was a PU.1 enhancer in B cells but a repressor in T cell precursors. TCF transcription factors coordinated this repressor function and linked PU.1 to Wnt signaling. Failure of appropriate PU.1 repression in T cell progenitors with URE deletion disrupted differentiation and induced thymic transformation. Genome-wide DNA methylation assessment showed that epigenetic silencing of selective tumor suppressor genes completed PU.1-initiated transformation of lymphoid progenitors with URE deletion. These results elucidate how a single transcription factor, PU.1, through the cell context-specific activity of a key cis-regulatory element, affects the development of multiple cell lineages and can induce cancer."

Hepatic SREBP-1c is nutritionally regulated, and its sustained activation causes hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Although regulation of SREBP-1c is known to occur at the transcriptional level, the precise mechanism by which insulin signaling activates SREBP-1c promoter remains to be elucidated. Here we show that protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) is a key mediator of insulin-mediated activation of hepatic SREBP-1c and its target lipogenic genes. Activation of SREBP-1c in the liver of refed mice was suppressed by either adenoviral RNAi-mediated knockdown or dietary administration of a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C beta. The effect of PKCbeta inhibition was cancelled in insulin depletion by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment of mice. Promoter analysis indicated that PKCbeta activates SREBP-1c promoter through replacement of Sp3 by Sp1 for binding to the GC box in the sterol regulatory element (SRE) complex, a key cis-element of SREBP-1c promoter. Knockdown of Sp proteins demonstrated that Sp3 and Sp1 play reciprocally negative and positive roles in nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c, respectively. This new understanding of PKCbeta involvement in nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c activation provides a new aspect of PKCbeta inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic complications."

In the present study, we show that Cidea mRNA levels are markedly reduced by fasting and are restored upon refeeding in mouse livers. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, the promoter region of the mouse Cidea gene was analysed and a putative SRE (sterol-regulatory element) was identified. Studies using luciferase reporter constructs together with electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of SREBP-1c (SRE-binding protein 1c) to the putative SRE. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c led to a dramatic increase in Cidea mRNA. In contrast with the induction of Cidea expression by insulin and TO901317 in wild-type mouse hepatocytes, the stimulatory effects were lost in hepatocytes prepared from SREBP-1c-null mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Cidea in hepatocytes promoted lipid accumulation and triacylglycerol (triglyceride) storage; however, knockdown of Cidea compromised the ability of SREBP-1c to stimulate lipid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggest that SREBP-1c directly mediates the effect of insulin on Cidea in hepatocytes and that Cidea, at least in part, mediates SREBP-1c-dependent lipid accumulation."

The nascent SREBP-1c is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be transported to the Golgi where two sequential cleavages generate its NH(2)-terminal fragment, nSREBP-1c. We have shown recently that in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, insulin rapidly and selectively stimulates proteolytic processing of the nascent SREBP-1c by enhancing the affinity of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP).SREBP-1c complex for coatomer protein complex II (COPII) vesicles. The SCAP.SREBP complex is retained in the ER by Insig proteins. We report here that insulin persistently stimulates controlled proteolysis of the nascent SREBP-1c by selectively reducing the level of Insig-2a protein via accelerated degradation of its cognate mRNA. Insulin enhanced the rate of turnover of Insig-2a mRNA via its 3'-untranslated region. Insulin-induced depletion of Insig-2a promotes association of the SCAP.SREBP-1c complex with COPII vesicles and subsequent migration to the Golgi where site-1 and site-2 proteases process the nascent SREBP-1c. Consistent with this mechanism, experimental knockdown of Insig-2a expression with small interfering RNA mimicked insulin-induced proteolysis of the nascent SREBP-1c, whereas exogenous expression of Insig-2a in hepatocytes led to reduced intramembrane proteolysis of the newly synthesized SREBP-1c. The action of insulin on the processing of the nascent SREBP-1c via Insig-2a was highly selective, as proteolysis of the newly synthesized SREBP-2 remained unchanged under identical conditions. On the basis of these data, we propose that the stimulation of SREBP-1c processing by insulin is mediated by a selective depletion of Insig-2a protein by promoting decay of its cognate mRNA. Thus, insulin-induced reduction in Insig-2a protein leads to an enhanced export of the SCAP.SREBP-1c complex from ER to the Golgi."

Using single cell transcriptomics, we defined the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. Reconstruction of gene expression dynamics from these data indicate a pivotal role for the MN determinant Olig2 just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2 represses expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation."

A disruption of sequence integrity at 6292-bp upstream of RFL by a T-DNA insertion led to varied RFL expression patterns in floral meristem and floret in afo1 and caused the mutant phenotype. The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factor and its homologs affect many aspects of plant development, especially floral development. RICE FLORICAULA/LEAFY (RFL), the rice ortholog of LFY, has complicated expression patterns and different functions in floral development. However, the mechanisms regulating the spatial-temporal expression of RFL remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a rice aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) mutant that was produced by a T-DNA insertion at 6292-bp upstream of the start codon of RFL. This insertion altered the expression of RFL in floral meristem (FM) and floret. The in situ hybridization result showed that, when florets appear, RFL was expressed almost exclusively at the palea/lemma adaxial base adjacent to lodicules in the wild-type panicle. However, in afo1 florets, RFL mRNA signals were detected in the region between lodicule and stamen, and strong signals persisted in FM. The altered pattern of RFL expression in afo1 resulted in enlarged FMs, more floral organs, aberrant floral organ identity, and loss of FM determinacy. Transformation of rice with an RFL construct driven by the 6292-bp upstream genomic sequence re-built the mutant phenotype similar to afo1. The results suggest that the far-upstream region of RFL may contain potential cis element(s) that are critical to define the precise spatial-temporal expression pattern of RFL for its function in floral development."

However, the impact of fructose intake on maternal and fetal lipid metabolism during pregnancy is not known. The aim of this study was to examine whether maternal fructose intake during pregnancy would affect fetal and maternal hepatic lipid metabolism. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into untreated control and fructose-treated groups; the fructose-treated group received fructose via drinking water throughout pregnancy. On gestational day 20, glucose and insulin concentration in the maternal plasma were measured. The mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c and its target genes in the liver of dams and fetuses were analyzed by real-time PCR. Significantly higher maternal plasma glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia, was observed in the fructose-treated group than in the control group. Furthermore, the fructose-treated group showed significantly higher expression levels of both maternal and fetal SREBP-1c mRNA and protein and significantly elevated expression of fatty acid synthase; the group also showed reduced acyl-CoA oxidase levels in the maternal liver. Thus, our results suggest that maternal fructose intake during pregnancy causes maternal hyperglycemia and up-regulates hepatic SREBP-1c expression in both fetuses and dams. This may lead to defects in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the adult offspring. "

Although less effective in TgAL, the adipocyte size was significantly reduced in WdCR compared with WdAL. This CR effect was blunted in Tg rats. We also used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to examine the gene expression profile of WAT of WdAL, WdCR, and TgAL rats. The gene expression profile of WdCR, but not TgAL, differed greatly from that of WdAL. The gene clusters with the largest changes induced by CR but not by Tg were genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and inflammation, particularly sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs)-regulated and macrophage-related genes, respectively. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the expression of SREBP-1 and its downstream targets was upregulated, whereas the macrophage-related genes were downregulated in WdCR, but not in TgAL. In addition, CR affected the gene expression profile of Tg rats similarly to wild-type rats. Our findings suggest that CR-associated remodeling of WAT, which involves SREBP-1-mediated transcriptional activation and suppression of macrophage infiltration, is regulated in a GH-IGF-1-independent manner.

The insertion of SPRE markedly increased a reporter gene (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag) expression without affecting the amounts of nuclear or cytoplasmic transcript. Deletion analysis identified a required sequence for SPRE activity, and the prediction of the RNA secondary structure demonstrated a common secondary structure found among active SPRE sequences. Another human syncytin, syncytin-2, also requires a 3'UTR for efficient gene expression. These data provide insights into post-transcriptional regulation in endogenous retroviral gene expression."

In this report, we map the RNA element to which small RNA annealing promotes HCV to nucleotides 1-44 and identify the relative impact of small RNA annealing on virus translation promotion and genome stabilization. We mapped the optimal region on the HCV genome to which small RNA annealing promotes virus replication to nucleotides 19-37 and found the efficiency of viral RNA accumulation decreased as annealing moved away from this region. Then, by using a panel of small RNAs that promote replication with varying efficiencies we link the efficiency of lifecycle promotion with translation stimulation. By contrast small RNA annealing stabilized the viral genome even if they did not promote virus replication. Thus, we propose that miR-122 annealing promotes HCV replication by annealing to an RNA element that activates the HCV IRES and stimulates translation, and that miR-122 induced HCV genome stabilization is insufficient alone but enhances virus replication."

In this study, we investigated whether AMPK activation and SREBP-1c inhibition contribute to the beneficial effects of metformin on IRS-1-associated insulin signaling in L6 myotubes. L6 muscle cells were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) to induce insulin resistance and then treated with metformin and/or the AMPK inhibitor, compound C. AMPK, SREBP-1c, IRS-1 and Akt protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. The effects of metformin on SREBP-1c gene transcription were determined by a luciferase reporter assay. Glucose uptake was evaluated using the 2-NBDG method. In the PA-treated L6 cells, metformin treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, reduced SREBP-1c expression and increased IRS-1 and Akt protein expression, whereas treatment with compound C blocked the effects of metformin on SREBP-1c expression and the IRS-1 and Akt levels. Moreover, metformin suppressed SREBP-1c promoter activity and promoted glucose uptake through AMPK. The results from this study demonstrate that metformin ameliorates PA-induced insulin resistance through the activation of AMPK and the suppression of SREBP-1c in skeletal muscle cells."

We investigated the dynamic changes and the underlying regulatory mechanism of postprandial FFA profile in hyperlipidemia (HLP) and their relation with insulin sensitivity in both humans and mice. We found that serum stearic acid (SA) is the only fatty acid that is increased dramatically in the postprandial state. The elevation of SA is due to increased insulin-stimulated de novo synthesis mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase/fatty acid synthase/elongation of long-chain fatty acid family member 6 (ELOVL6) and the elongation of palmitic acid (PA) catalyzed by ELOVL6. Downregulation of SREBP-1c or ELOVL6 by small interfering RNA can reduce SA synthesis in liver and serum SA level, followed by amelioration of IR in HLP mice. However, inhibition of SREBP-1c is more effective in improving IR than suppression of ELOVL6, which resulted in accumulation of PA. In summary, increased postprandial SA is caused by the insulin-stimulated SREBP-1c pathway and elongation of PA in HLP. Reduction of postprandial SA is a good candidate for improving IR, and SREBP-1c is potentially a better target to prevent IR and diabetes by decreasing SA."

We hypothesized that soy protein-fed rats would have a lower risk of CVD by beneficial alteration of gene expression involving lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity in DSS-induced systemic inflammation. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: casein, casein + DSS, soy protein, and soy protein + DSS. After 26 days, inflammation was induced in one group from each diet by incorporating 3% DSS in drinking water for 48 hours. Soy protein-fed rats had lower final body weights (P = .010), epididymal fat weights (P = .049), total cholesterol (P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001). In regard to gene expression, soy protein-fed rats had lower sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (P = .032) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (P = .028) levels and higher low-density lipoprotein receptor levels (P = .036). Antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase was higher among the soy protein groups (P = .037 and P = .002, respectively).

During adipogenesis SREBP-1 stimulates lipogenic gene expression, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) enhances perilipin (plin) gene expression, resulting in generating lipid droplets (LDs) to store triacylglycerol (TAG) in adipocytes. Plin coats adipocyte LDs and protects them from lipolysis. Here we show in white adipose tissue (WAT) of plin-/- mice that nuclear active SREBP-1 and its target gene expression, but not nuclear SREBP-2, significantly decreased on attenuated LD formation. When plin-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) differentiated into adipocytes, attenuated LDs were formed and nuclear SREBP-1 decreased, but enforced plin expression restored them to their original state. Since LDs are largely derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), alterations in the ER cholesterol content were investigated during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. The ER cholesterol greatly reduced in differentiated adipocytes. The ER cholesterol level in plin-/- WAT was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice, suggesting that increased LD formation caused a change in ER environment along with a decrease in cholesterol. When GFP-SREBP-1 fusion proteins were exogenously expressed in 3T3-L1 cells, a mutant protein lacking the S1P cleavage site was poorly processed during adipogenesis, providing evidence of the increased canonical pathway for SREBP processing in which SREBP-1 is activated by two cleavage enzymes in the Golgi. Therefore, LD biogenesis may create the ER microenvironment favorable for SREBP-1 activation. We describe the novel interplay between LD formation and SREBP-1 activation through a positive feedback loop."

Despite the suggestion that regulatory element disruption represents a common theme, identifying causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based computational method to predict the effect of regulatory variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) that encodes cell type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays. Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores, and we predict new risk-conferring SNPs for several autoimmune diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational approach to systematically identify functional regulatory variants. "

How this enzyme is regulated transcriptionally by sterols is currently unclear. Some studies have suggested that its expression is regulated by Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) while another suggests it is through the Liver X Receptor (LXR). However, these transcription factors have opposing effects on cellular sterol levels, so it is likely that one predominates. Here we establish that sterol regulation of DHCR24 occurs predominantly through SREBP-2, and identify the particular region of the DHCR24 promoter to which SREBP-2 binds. We demonstrate that sterol regulation is mediated by two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter of the gene, assisted by two nearby NF-Y binding sites. Moreover, we present evidence that the dual SREs work cooperatively to regulate DHCR24 expression by comparison to two known SREBP target genes, the LDL receptor with one SRE, and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, with two SREs."

Here, we define a 1007 bp cis-regulatory element 5' of the Hand1 gene sufficient to drive reporter expression within the sympathetic chain of transgenic mice. Comparative genomic analyses uncovered evolutionarily conserved consensus-binding sites within this element, which chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirm are bound by Hand2 and Phox2b. Mutational analyses revealed that the conserved Phox2 and E-box binding sites are necessary for proper cis-regulatory element activity, and expression analyses on both Hand2 conditionally null and hypomorphic backgrounds demonstrate that Hand2 is required for reporter activation in a gene dosage-dependent manner. We demonstrate that Hand2 and Hand1 differentially bind the E-boxes in this cis-regulatory element, establishing molecular differences between these two factors. Finally, we demonstrate that Hand1 is dispensable for normal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) expression in sympathetic neurons, even when Hand2 gene dosage is concurrently reduced by half. Together, these data define a tissue-specific Hand1 cis-regulatory element controlled by two factors essential for the development of the sympathetic nervous system and provide in vivo regulatory evidence to support previous findings that Hand2, rather than Hand1, is predominantly responsible for regulating TH, DBH, and Hand1 expression in developing sympathetic neurons."

However, the impact of RBP4 on aberrant lipogenesis, the common hepatic manifestation in insulin resistance states, and the underlying mechanism remain elusive. The present study was designed to examine the effect of RBP4 on sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1) and hepatic lipogenesis. Treatment with human retinol-bound RBP4 (holo-RBP4) significantly induced intracellular triglyceride (TAG) synthesis in HepG2 cells and this effect is retinol-independent. Furthermore, RBP4 treatment enhanced the levels of mature SREBP-1 and its nuclear translocation, thereby increasing the expression of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase-1 (ACC-1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT-2). Stimulation of HepG2 cells with RBP4 strongly up-regulated the expression of transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. The transcriptional activation of PGC-1β is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional activation of SREBP-1 in response to RBP4. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) was identified as the target transcription factor involved in the RBP4-mediated up-regulation of PGC-1β transcription as a result of phosphorylation on Ser133.

However, there is no general explanation why apparently similar variations may have either no effect on splicing or cause significant splicing alterations. In this work we have examined the structural architecture of pseudoexons previously described in ATM and CFTR patients. The ATM case derives from the deletion of a repressor element and is characterized by an aberrant 5'ss selection despite the presence of better alternatives. The CFTR pseudoexon instead derives from the creation of a new 5'ss that is used while a nearby pre-existing donor-like sequence is never selected. Our results indicate that RNA structure is a major splicing regulatory factor in both cases. Furthermore, manipulation of the original RNA structures can lead to pseudoexon inclusion following the exposure of unused 5'ss already present in their wild-type intronic sequences and prevented to be recognized because of their location in RNA stem structures. Our data show that intrinsic structural features of introns must be taken into account to understand the mechanism of pseudoexon activation in genetic diseases. Our observations may help to improve diagnostics prediction programmes and eventual therapeutic targeting."

Nevertheless, it alters the binding of downstream BLG sequences to histone H4 and the sensitivity of the histone-DNA complexes to trichostatin A treatment. In mammary cells cultured under favorable lactogenic conditions, BLG-e1 acts as a potent, position-independent silencer of BLG/luciferase expression, and similarly affects the promoter activity of the mouse whey acidic protein gene.

NEMO is a scaffold protein required for canonical NF-κB signaling. Transcription of the NEMO gene is primarily controlled by two promoters: one (promoter B) drives NEMO transcription in most cell types and the second (promoter D) is largely responsible for NEMO transcription in liver cells. Herein, we have used a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to disrupt a core sequence element of promoter B, and this genetic editing essentially eliminates expression of NEMO mRNA and protein in 293T human kidney cells. By cell subcloning, we have isolated targeted 293T cell lines that express no detectable NEMO protein, have defined genomic alterations at promoter B, and do not support activation of canonical NF-κB signaling in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor. Nevertheless, non-canonical NF-κB signaling is intact in these NEMO-deficient cells. Expression of ectopic wild-type NEMO, but not certain human NEMO disease mutants, in the edited cells restores downstream NF-κB signaling in response to tumor necrosis factor. Targeting of the promoter B element does not substantially reduce NEMO expression (from promoter D) in the human SNU-423 liver cancer cell line. Thus, we have created a strategy for selectively eliminating cell type-specific expression from an alternative promoter and have generated 293T cell lines with a functional knockout of NEMO. The implications of these findings for further studies and for therapeutic approaches to target canonical NF-κB signaling are discussed."

First, pigmentation variation in the adult female was measured at seven different body positions in 20 strains from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) originating from a natural population in North Carolina. Next, to assess the contributions of cis-regulatory polymorphisms of the genes involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, allele-specific expression levels of four genes were quantified by amplicon sequencing using a 454 GS Junior. Among those genes, ebony was significantly associated with pigmentation intensity of the thoracic segment. Detailed sequence analysis of the gene regulatory regions of this gene indicated that many different functional cis-regulatory alleles are segregating in the population and that variations outside the core enhancer element could potentially play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, a slight enrichment of distantly associated SNP pairs was observed in the ~10 kb cis-regulatory region of ebony, which suggested the presence of interacting elements scattered across the region. In contrast, sequence analysis in the core cis-regulatory region of tan indicated that SNPs within the region are significantly associated with allele-specific expression level of this gene. Collectively, the data suggest that the underlying genetic differences in the cis-regulatory regions that control intraspecific pigmentation variation can be more complex than those of interspecific pigmentation trait differences, where causal genetic changes are typically confined to modular enhancer elements."

Despite its strong dependence on TSH, the master regulator of the thyroid, the NIS gene was also reported to be regulated by non-TSH signaling pathways. In the present study we provide evidence that the rat NIS gene is subject to regulation by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which were initially identified as master transcriptional regulators of lipid biosynthesis and uptake. Studies in FRTL-5 thyrocytes revealed that TSH stimulates expression and maturation of SREBPs and expression of classical SREBP target genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and uptake. Almost identical effects were observed when the cAMP agonist forskolin was used instead of TSH. In TSH receptor-deficient mice, in which TSH/cAMP-dependent gene regulation is blocked, the expression of SREBP isoforms in the thyroid was markedly reduced when compared with wild-type mice. Sterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP maturation and/or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SREBPs reduced expression of NIS and NIS-specific iodide uptake in FRTL-5 cells. Conversely, overexpression of active SREBPs caused a strong activation of the 5'-flanking region of the rat NIS gene mediated by binding to a functional SREBP binding site located in the 5'-untranslated region of the rat NIS gene. These findings show that TSH acts as a regulator of SREBP expression and maturation in thyroid epithelial cells and that SREBPs are novel transcriptional regulators of NIS."

Here, we show that a highly conserved Distal-less regulatory element (DCRE) that controls gene expression in leg precursor cells recruits multiple Hox, Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) complexes to mediate dual outputs: thoracic activation and abdominal repression. Using reporter assays, we found that abdominal repression is particularly robust, as neither individual binding site mutations nor a DNA binding deficient Hth protein abolished cooperative DNA binding and in vivo repression. Moreover, a re-engineered DCRE containing a distinct configuration of Hox, Exd, and Hth sites also mediated abdominal Hox repression. However, the re-engineered DCRE failed to perform additional segment-specific functions such as thoracic activation. These findings are consistent with two emerging concepts in gene regulation: First, the abdominal Hox/Exd/Hth factors utilize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to form repression complexes on flexible combinations of sites, consistent with the TF collective model of CRM organization. Second, the conserved DCRE mediates multiple cell-type specific outputs, consistent with recent findings that pleiotropic CRMs are associated with conserved TF binding and added evolutionary constraints.

However, the mechanisms regulating human ABO gene expression remain obscure. On the basis of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in and upstream of ABO in K562 cells, in the present study, we prepared reporter plasmid constructs including these sites. Subsequent luciferase assays indicated a novel positive regulatory element in intron 1. This element was shown to enhance ABO promoter activity in an erythroid cell-specific manner. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated that it bound to the tissue-restricted transcription factor GATA-1. Mutation of the GATA motifs to abrogate binding of this factor reduced the regulatory activity of the element. Therefore, GATA-1 appears to be involved in the cell-specific activity of the element. Furthermore, we found that a partial deletion in intron 1 involving the element was associated with B(m) phenotypes. Therefore, it is plausible that deletion of the erythroid cell-specific regulatory element could down-regulate transcription in the B(m) allele, leading to reduction of B-antigen expression in cells of erythroid lineage, but not in mucus-secreting cells. These results support the contention that the enhancer-like element in intron 1 of ABO has a significant function in erythroid cells."

We investigated the effect of the specific SREBP suppressor andrographolide, a natural compound isolated from Andrographis paniculata, on the regulation of SREBP signaling by use of Western blot, reporter gene assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. In addition, the antiobesity effects of andrographolide were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Our results showed that andrographolide downregulated the expressions of SREBPs target genes and decreased cellular lipid accumulation in vitro. Further, andrographolide (100 mg/kg per day) attenuated HFD-induced body weight gain and fat accumulation in liver or adipose tissues, and improved serum lipid levels and insulin or glucose sensitivity in HFD-induced obese mice. Andrographolide effectively suppressed the respiratory quotient, energy expenditure, and oxygen consumption, which may have contributed to the decreased body-weight gain of the obese mice fed with a HFD. Consistently, andrographolide regulated SREBP target genes and metabolism-associated genes in liver or brown adipose tissue, which may have directly contributed to the lower lipid levels and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Taken together, our results indicated that andrographolide ameliorated lipid metabolism and improved glucose use in mice with HFD-induced obesity. Andrographolide has potential as a leading compound in the prevention or treatment of obesity and insulin resistance. "

In contrast high levels of cholesterol in the blood are known to be a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. We formulate a deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equation model of the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) cholesterol genetic regulatory pathway in a hepatocyte. The mathematical model includes a description of genetic transcription by SREBP-2 which is subsequently translated to mRNA leading to the formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a main regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol synthesis subsequently leads to the regulation of SREBP-2 via a negative feedback formulation. Parameterised with data from the literature, the model is used to understand how SREBP-2 transcription and regulation affects cellular cholesterol concentration. Model stability analysis shows that the only positive steady-state of the system exhibits purely oscillatory, damped oscillatory or monotic behaviour under certain parameter conditions. In light of our findings we postulate how cholesterol homeostasis is maintained within the cell and the advantages of our model formulation are discussed with respect to other models of genetic regulation within the literature.

Because sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are the major transcriptional factors in lipogenic gene expression including fatty acid synthase (FAS), we examined the effects of HCV nonstructural proteins on the signaling pathways of SREBP. In this study, we demonstrated that HCV nonstructural 4B (NS4B) protein increased the transcriptional activities of SREBPs. We also showed that HCV NS4B enhanced the protein expression levels of SREBPs and FAS. This was further confirmed in the context of viral RNA replication and HCV infection. The up-regulation of both SREBP and FAS by NS4B protein required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. We also demonstrated that NS4B protein induced a lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells. In addition, NS4B protein synergistically elevated the transcriptional activity of HCV core-mediated SREBP-1. These results strongly suggest that NS4B may play an important role in HCV-associated liver pathogenesis by modulating the SREBP signaling pathway."

Its role in the RNA metabolism of the viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is currently unknown. We identified a positively cis-acting splicing regulatory element (SRE-1) and present two lines of evidence for its functionality. Firstly, in a heterologous context SRE-1 functionally substitutes for a retroviral bidirectional exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). As expected, SRE-1 is a splicing enhancer also in its natural viral sequence context, since deletion of SRE-1 reduces splicing of pgRNA in cell culture experiments. Secondly, we show that stimulation of HBV RNA splicing by the splicing factor PSF was repressed by the PRE. Analysis of a variety of PSF mutants indicated that RNA-binding and protein-protein interaction were required to enhance splicing. In addition, we show that the PRE contributed to pgRNA stability, but has little influence on its nuclear export. Herein, we report for the first time that the PRE harbors splicing stimulating and inhibiting regulatory elements controlling processing of the viral pregenome. We discuss a model in which the regulation of pgRNA splicing depends on cellular factors interacting with the PRE."

The potential mechanism of FGF21 regulating lipogenesis was also explored, which revealed that FGF21 repressed the transcription of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), an essential transcription factor promoting expression of lipogenesis-related genes. Overexpression of FGF21 ameliorated the up-regulation of SREBP1c and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in HepG2 cells elicited by FFAs treatment. Moreover, FGF21 could inhibit the transcriptional levels of the key genes involved in processing and nuclear translocation of SREBP1c, and decrease the protein amount of mature SREBP1c. Unexpectedly, overexpression of SREBP1c in HepG2 cells could also inhibit the endogenous FGF21 transcription. Further experiments demonstrated that SREBP1c could significantly attenuate the promoter activity of FGF21. In conclusion, our data identifies a clear link between FGF21 and SREBP1c during lipogenesis in hepatocyte in culture."

The rat and human SYN1 promoters exhibited similar but weak activity in neurons, despite inclusion of the WPRE. We confirmed that the WPRE enhanced RSV promoter-mediated DsRed-X expression in a time-dependent fashion. Interestingly, we observed very weak SYN1-mediated DsRed-X expression in astrocytes and HEK293 cells suggesting incomplete neuronal-restrictive behavior for this promoter.

Upregulation of SULT2B1b may be an effective strategy to treat hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. The objective of the study was to explore the effect and mechanism of oxysterol sulfation by SULT2B1b on lipid metabolism in vivo. C57BL/6 and LDLR(-/-) mice were fed with high-cholesterol diet or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and infected with adenovirus encoding SULT2B1b. SULT2B1b expressions in different tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Sulfated oxysterols in liver were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Serum and hepatic lipid levels were determined by kit reagents and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Gene expressions were determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot. Following infection, SULT2B1b was successfully overexpressed in the liver, aorta, and lung tissues, but not in the heart or kidney. SULT2B1b overexpression, combined with administration of 25-hydroxycholesterol, significantly increased the formation of 25HC3S in liver tissue and significantly decreased serum and hepatic lipid levels, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and free fatty acids, as compared with controls in both C57BL/6 and LDLR(-/-) mice. Gene expression analysis showed that increases in SULT2B1b expression were accompanied by reduction in key regulators and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including liver X receptor α, SREBP-1, SREBP-2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1, and fatty acid synthase. These findings support the hypothesis that 25HC3S is an important endogenous regulator of lipid biosynthesis."

Release of membrane-bound SREBP requires SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) to escort SREBP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi for cleavage by site-1 and site-2 proteases. SCAP then recycles to the ER for additional rounds of SREBP binding and transport. Mechanisms regulating ER-to-Golgi transport of SCAP-SREBP are understood in molecular detail, but little is known about SCAP recycling. Here, we have demonstrated that SCAP Golgi-to-ER transport requires cleavage of SREBP at site-1. Reductions in SREBP cleavage lead to SCAP degradation in lysosomes, providing additional negative feedback control to the SREBP pathway. Current models suggest that SREBP plays a passive role prior to cleavage. However, we show that SREBP actively prevents premature recycling of SCAP-SREBP until initiation of SREBP cleavage. SREBP regulates SCAP in human cells and yeast, indicating that this is an ancient regulatory mechanism. "

We investigated the protective effect of Ex-4 against lipotoxicity, mediated by a repression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a regulator of genes expression involved in fat and cholesterol synthesis. To observe the effect of Ex-4, we evaluated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and apoptosis in the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line, which were cultured in DMEM medium containing 500 μM palmitate, with or without 10 nM Ex-4. We also examined the roles of SREBP-1c in lipotoxicity model by knockdown with si-RNA. Treatment with Ex-4 improved insulin secretion and survival as well as reduced SREBP-1c expression and activity in palmitate-treated MIN6 cells. This improvement was accompanied with an upregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and LY294.002, a specific inhibitor of PI3 kinase, abrogated effects of Ex-4 on insulin secretion. Moreover, SREBP-1c in nuclei was increased by the inhibition of PI3 kinase. Lipotoxic effects of palmitate in the insulin secretion and apoptosis were significantly prevented by SREBP-1 knockdown.

We used two types of constructs to analyze the function of this DNA: P-element based reporter constructs with small pieces of DNA fused to the en promoter driving lacZ expression and large constructs with HA-tagged en and inv inserted in the genome with the phiC31 system. In addition, we generated deletions of inv and en DNA in situ and assayed their effects on inv/en expression. Our results support and extend our knowledge of inv/en regulation. First, inv and en share regulatory DNA, most of which is flanking the en transcription unit. In support of this, a 79-kb HA-en transgene can rescue inv en double mutants to viable, fertile adults. In contrast, an 84-kb HA-inv transgene lacks most of the enhancers for inv/en expression. Second, there are multiple enhancers for inv/en stripes in embryos; some of these may be redundant but others play discrete roles at different stages of embryonic development. Finally, no small reporter construct gave expression in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs, a hallmark of inv/en expression. Robust expression of HA-en in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs is evident from the 79-kb HA-en transgene, while a 45-kb HA-en transgene gives weaker, variable imaginal disc expression. We suggest that the activity of the imaginal disc enhancer(s) is dependent on the chromatin structure of the inv/en domain."

Here, we introduce a probabilistic modeling framework for the evolution of CREs that operates directly on raw chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and fully considers the phylogenetic relationships among species. Our framework includes a phylogenetic hidden Markov model, called epiPhyloHMM, for identifying the locations of multiply aligned CREs, and a combined phylogenetic and generalized linear model, called phyloGLM, for accounting for the influence of a rich set of genomic features in describing their evolutionary dynamics. We apply these methods to previously published ChIP-seq data for the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications in liver tissue from nine mammals. We find that enhancers are gained and lost during mammalian evolution at about twice the rate of promoters, and that turnover rates are negatively correlated with DNA sequence conservation, expression level, and tissue breadth, and positively correlated with distance from the transcription start site, consistent with previous findings. In addition, we find that the predicted dosage sensitivity of target genes positively correlates with DNA sequence constraint in CREs but not with turnover rates, perhaps owing to differences in the effect sizes of the relevant mutations. Altogether, our probabilistic modeling framework enables a variety of powerful new analyses."

Various degrees of severity have been described according to age at onset and survival, without any clear genotype-phenotype correlation. All types of nucleotide changes have been observed in CS genes, including splice variations mainly affecting the splice site consensus sequences. We report here the case of two brothers from a consanguineous family presenting a severe but long-term survival phenotype of Cockayne syndrome. We identified in the patients a homozygous deep intronic nucleotide variation causing the insertion of a cryptic exon in the ERCC8 (CSA) transcript, by modifying intronic regulatory elements important for exon definition. The pathogenesis of the nucleotide variant NG_009289.1(NM_000082.3):c.173+1119G>C was validated in vitro with a reporter minigene system. To our knowledge, these are the first Cockayne patients described with this kind of disease-causing variation, though molecular mechanism underlying early onset symptoms and unexpected slow raise of progression of the disease remain to be elucidated."

Here, we have sought to define the complex of transcription factors that interact at this element. Consistent with activin regulation at GRAS, gel shift analyses and yeast one-hybrid assays reveal Smad4 interaction at the 5' end of GRAS. While overexpression of Smad3 activates a GRAS reporter, Smad3 binding at GRAS was not detectable. A functional interaction of Smad3 at GRAS was, however, detectable in yeast expressing Smad4. Thus, Smad3 interaction at GRAS appears to be dependent on the presence of Smad4. Mutations located at the 3' end of GRAS do not affect Smad binding but eliminate functional activity. Thus, Smad binding alone cannot account for the functional attributes of GRAS. Consistent with this notion, we find that AP-1 binding is immediately juxtaposed to and, in fact, partially overlaps the Smad binding site. Finally, a recently identified member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FoxL2, is also capable of interacting at GRAS. Furthermore, FoxL2 activation at GRAS is lost with mutation of either the 5' Smad binding site or a putative forkhead binding site located at the 3' end of the element. We suggest that GRAS is a composite regulatory element whose functional activity is dependent on the organization of a multi-protein complex consisting of Smads, AP-1 and a member of the forkhead family of DNA binding proteins."

AAV8 was reported as the most efficient AAV serotype for transduction of the liver, brain and muscle compared with other serotypes. However, AAV8-mediated transduction of human hepatocytes is rather poor with approximately 20-fold lower efficiency compared with that of mouse hepatocytes. Therefore, we applied the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to enhance AAV8-mediated transgene expression driven by a combination promoter (CAG promoter) with a CMV-IE enhancer and chicken beta-actin promoter for a more efficient viral vector. Transgene expression from recombinant AAV8 (rAAV8) vectors harboring a red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter gene with or without WPRE were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that WPRE improved AAV8-mediated RFP expression in different cell lines with clear increases of transgene expression in the liver, brain or muscle of animals. The findings of this study will help to substantially reduce the quantity of viral particles that must be injected in order to reach a therapeutic level of transgene expression in gene therapy. Consequently, such dose reductions may lessen the potential risks associated with high doses of viral vectors. "

The human renin gene contains a direct repeat (DR) motif AGGGGTCAC-AGGGCCA in the proximal region (-259/-245 bp), which contains similar sequence for nuclear receptor superfamily binding core motif, AGGTCA, and is the most similar to COUP-TFII consensus. The DR motif was evaluated as a functional cis-element with renal cortex and chorio-decidual cells by footprint assay, electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and reporter assay. The DR motif site was protected by footprint analysis with a clear hypersensitive and a minor hypersensitive region in good accordance with the DR of the consensus. One of the binding proteins was strongly suspected to be COUP-TFII-consensus-specific by EMSA. The DNA/protein complexes obtained with nuclear extract of renin producing cells could be completely blocked by homologous competitor and strongly blocked by the second-half mutant oligonucleotide of the DR motif but not by the first-half mutant oligonucleotide. Finally, the transcriptional activity of second-half mutant construct is slightly elevated and that first-half mutant construct is significantly stronger by twofold compared with wild type construct in reporter assay. These findings suggest that the DR motif site of the human renin gene functions as a negative regulatory element involved in a twofold repression of transcription and that member(s) of nucleic receptor superfamily bind the site and play important roles in the human renin gene expression with a possibility that one of the binding protein is COUP-TFII."

Post hoc analyses of this interval utilizing five commonly used measures of evolutionary constraint (AVID, MLAGAN, SLAGAN, phastCons, WebMCS) demonstrate that each systematically overlooks regulatory sequences. These established algorithms detected only 29%-61% of our identified regulatory elements, consistent with the suggestion that many regulatory sequences may not be readily detected by metrics of sequence constraint. However, we were able to discriminate functional from nonfunctional sequences based upon GC composition and identified position weight matrices (PWM), demonstrating that, in at least one case, deleting sequences containing a subset of these PWMs from one identified regulatory element abrogated its regulatory function. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the noncoding functional component of vertebrate genomes may far exceed estimates predicated on evolutionary constraint."

Although the presence of additional control elements has been postulated to regulate rearrangements of the VH gene array that extends to the 5' end of the locus, the 5' border of Igh and its flanking region have not been characterized. To facilitate the analysis of this unexplored region and to identify potential novel control elements, we physically mapped the most D-distal VH segments and scanned 46 kb of the immediate 5' flanking region for DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our studies revealed a cluster of hypersensitive sites 30 kb upstream of the most 5' VH gene. Detection of one site, HS1, is restricted to pro-B cell lines and HS1 is accessible to restriction enzyme digestion exclusively in normal pro-B cells, the stage defined by actively rearranging Igh-V loci. Sequence motifs within HS1 for PU.1, Pax5, and E2A bind these proteins in vitro and these factors are recruited to HS1 sequence only in pro-B cells. Transient transfection assays indicate that the Pax5 binding site is required for the repression of transcriptional activity of HS1-containing constructs. Thus, our characterization of the region 5' of the VH gene cluster demonstrated the presence of a single cluster of DNase I hypersensitive sites within the 5' flanking region, and identified a candidate Igh regulatory region defined by pro-B cell-specific hypersensitivity and interaction with factors implicated in regulating VDJ recombination."

Convergent evolution of the selfing syndrome suggests that these changes are adaptive, yet our understanding of the detailed molecular genetic basis of the selfing syndrome remains limited. Here, we investigate the role of cis-regulatory changes during the recent evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella rubella, which split from the outcrosser Capsella grandiflora less than 200 ka. We assess allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaves and flower buds at a total of 18,452 genes in three interspecific F1 C. grandiflora x C. rubella hybrids. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that accounts for technical variation using genomic reads, we find evidence for extensive cis-regulatory changes. On average, 44% of the assayed genes show evidence of ASE; however, only 6% show strong allelic expression biases. Flower buds, but not leaves, show an enrichment of cis-regulatory changes in genomic regions responsible for floral and reproductive trait divergence between C. rubella and C. grandiflora. We further detected an excess of heterozygous transposable element (TE) insertions near genes with ASE, and TE insertions targeted by uniquely mapping 24-nt small RNAs were associated with reduced expression of nearby genes. Our results suggest that cis-regulatory changes have been important during the recent adaptive floral evolution in Capsella and that differences in TE dynamics between selfing and outcrossing species could be important for rapid regulatory divergence in association with mating system shifts.

We find that a dominant promoter type of subspecies japonica displayed a high activity for Ghd8 expression in comparison with the one in indica. Transgenic analyses revealed that higher expression levels of Ghd8 delayed heading date and enhanced cold tolerance in rice. Furthermore, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (T1279G) at the position -1279 bp that locates on the potential GA-responsive motif in the Ghd8 promoter affected the expression of this gene. The 1279 T variant has elevated expression of Ghd8, thus conferring increased cold tolerance of rice seedlings. Nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that the approximately 25-kb genomic region surrounding Ghd8 in the subspecies japonica was under significant selection pressure.

Methanol extract of GM (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) or silymarin (100 mg/kg) was gavaged simultaneously with ethanol for three doses. GM administration significantly reduced the increases in serum ALT and AST levels, the serum and hepatic triglyceride levels, at 4 h after the last ethanol administration. GM was also found to prevent ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and necrosis, as indicated by liver histopathological studies. Additionally, GM suppressed the elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, restored the glutathione (GSH) levels, and enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities. The concurrent administration of GM efficaciously abrogated cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) induction. Moreover, GM significantly reduced the nuclear translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (nSREBP-1) in ethanol-treated mice.

Using a combination of cell biology and protein chemistry approach we show that SREBP-1a is also target of other MAPK-families, i.e. c-JUN N-terminal protein kinases (JNK) or p38 stress activated MAP kinases. Serine 117 is also the major phosphorylation site in SREBP-1a for JNK. In contrast to that the major phosphorylation sites of p38 MAPK family are serine 63 and threonine 426. Functional analyses reveal that phosphorylation of SREBP-1a does not alter protein/DNA interaction. The identified phosphorylation sites are specific for both kinase families also in cellular context. To provide direct evidence that phosphorylation of SREBP-1a is a regulatory principle of biological and clinical relevance, we generated transgenic mice expressing mature transcriptionally active N-terminal domain of human SREBP-1a variant lacking all identified phosphorylaton sites designed as alb-SREBP-1aΔP and wild type SREBP-1a designed as alb-SREBP-1a liver specific under control of the albumin promoter and a liver specific enhancer. In contrast to alb-SREBP-1a mice the phosphorylation-deficient mice develop no enlarged fatty livers under normocaloric conditions. Phenotypical examination reveales a massive accumulation of adipose tissue in alb-SREBP-1a but not in the phosphorylation deficient alb-SREBP-1aΔP mice. Moreover, preventing phosphorylation of SREBP-1a protects mice also from dyslipidemia.

To elucidate its involvement, we examined the activation of SREBP-la, expression of FAS genes and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of RA and/or H2O2. RA (1 microM) treatment suppressed expression of SREBP-1a and FAS genes and lipid accumulation.

Increased cleavage of SREBP-1a by H2O2 was also observed even in the presence of RA.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the expression of TNF-α in PDA, matching adjacent tissues, and benign lesions. Logistic regression models with robust variance were used to analyze the gene expression levels, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated. In vitro, we overexpressed the TNF-α gene in PDA cells and fibroblasts and analyzed its effect on cell survival, migration, and on members of the FAS signaling pathway. We also evaluated TNF-α effects on a panel of inflammation-, angiogenesis-, and metastasis-related markers. In the tumor tissue of PDA patients, compared with their matched adjacent tissue, expression levels of TNF-α were not statistically different and did not correlate with survival or any other examined clinicopathological features. Overexpression of TNF-α significantly (p < 0.05) reduced PDA and fibroblast cell migration. In PDA cells that highly overexpress TNF-α, this was associated with a significant reduction of FAS mRNA and protein expression levels and significant (p < 0.05) reduction of SREBP-1 and ACC mRNA. Reduction of FAS by TNF-α was inhibited when either SREBP-1 or ACC was knocked down by siRNA. PDA cells and fibroblasts that overexpress TNF-α displayed differential regulation of several inflammation-related markers and reduced levels of metastasis-related genes. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown multi-targeted involvement of TNF-α in PDA lipogenesis and inflammation and metastasis and suggest that intratumoral introduction of TNF-α may have the potential as a novel therapeutic approach in human PDA."

The mRNA and protein level expression of related factors were tested by qPCR and Western blot analyses. Cell proliferation was assessed by clone formation, CCK-8, and Ki-67 assays. Nile red and oil red O staining were performed to detect endogenous lipid levels. Immunofluorescence was used to localize the protein of SREBP-1. Finally, a tumor xenograft assay of nude mice was performed to assess the role of PLCε in prostate tumor generation. RESULTS We found that overexpression of PLCε indicates low PFS in PCa and is involved in metastasis of PCa, and that the PLCε/AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling network promotes the progression of PCa through lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to discover the lethal role of PLCε in lipid metabolism and malignant behavior of PCa, elucidation PCa occurrence and progression."

In addition to these advancements, numerous bioinformatics tools address important computational challenges, covering DNA methylation calling up to multi-modal interpretative analyses. However, contrary to the analytical frameworks that detect driver mutational signatures, the identification of putatively actionable epigenetic events remains an unmet need. The present work describes a novel computational framework, called MeinteR, that prioritizes critical DNA methylation events based on the following hypothesis: critical aberrations of DNA methylation more likely occur on a genomic substrate that is enriched in cis-acting regulatory elements with distinct structural characteristics, rather than in genomic ""deserts"". In this context, the framework incorporates functional cis-elements, e.g. transcription factor binding sites, tentative splice sites, as well as conformational features, such as G-quadruplexes and palindromes, to identify critical epigenetic aberrations with potential implications on transcriptional regulation. The evaluation on multiple, public cancer datasets revealed significant associations between the highest-ranking loci with gene expression and known driver genes, enabling for the first time the computational identification of high impact epigenetic changes based on high-throughput DNA methylation data."

The blockade of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been proposed for the treatment of obesity. Besides loss of body weight, CB1 antagonism improves insulin sensitivity, in which the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) plays a key role. The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of GLUT4-encoded gene (Slc2a4 gene) expression by CB1 receptor. For this, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence of a highly selective CB1 receptor agonist (1 μM arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide) and/or a CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist (0.1, 0.5, or 1 μM AM251, 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide). After acute (2 and 4 h) and chronic (24 h) treatments, cells were harvested to evaluate: i) Slc2a4, Cnr1 (CB1 receptor-encoded gene), and Srebf1 type a (SREBP-1a type-encoded gene) mRNAs (real-time PCR); ii) GLUT4 protein (western blotting); and iii) binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 specifically in the promoter of Slc2a4 gene (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Results revealed that both acute and chronic CB1 receptor antagonism greatly increased (∼2.5-fold) Slc2a4 mRNA and protein content. Additionally, CB1-induced upregulation of Slc2a4 was accompanied by decreased binding activity of NF-κB at 2 and 24 h, and by increased binding activity of the SREBP-1 at 24 h. In conclusion, these findings reveal that the blockade of CB1 receptor markedly increases Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in adipocytes, a feature that involves NF-κB and SREBP-1 transcriptional regulation."

In this assay, (Br)U-labelled DC5 was introduced for the efficient detection of transferred electrons from Sox2 and Pax6 to the DNA, and guanine base in the complementary strand was replaced with hypoxanthine (I) to block intra-strand electron transfer at the Sox2-binding site. By examining DNA cleavage occurred as a result of the electron transfer process, from tryptophan residues of Sox2 and Pax6 to DNA after irradiation at 280 nm, we not only confirmed their binding to DNA but also observed their increased occupancy on DC5 with respect to that of Sox2 and Pax6 alone as a result of their cooperative interaction."

Our goal is to understand which sites in mitochondrial DNA are prone to oxidation at long range and whether such oxidative damage correlates with cancerous transformation. Here we show that a primer extension reaction can be used to monitor directly oxidative damage to authentic mitochondrial DNA through photoreactions with a rhodium intercalator. The complex [Rh(phi)2bpy]Cl3 (phi = 9,10-phenanthrenequinone diimine) binds to DNA without sequence specificity and, upon photoactivation, either promotes strand breaks directly at the binding site or promotes one-electron oxidative damage; comparing the sites of base oxidation to direct strand breaks reveals the oxidative damage that arises from a distance through DNA-mediated charge transport. Significantly, base oxidation by charge transport overlaps with known mutational hot spots associated with cancers at nucleotides surrounding positions 263 and 303; the latter is known as conserved sequence block II and is vital to DNA replication. Since DNA base oxidation at conserved sequence block II should weaken the ability of damaged mitochondrial genomes to be replicated, DNA-mediated charge transport may provide a protection mechanism for excluding damaged DNA."
15914226,,Characterization of an upstream regulatory element of adenovirus L1 poly (A) site.,2005,Virology,10.1016/j.virol.2005.04.013,['Li Liu'],[],"The transition from early to late stage infection by adenovirus involves a change in mRNA expression from the adenovirus major late transcription unit (AdMLTU). This early to late switch centers around alternative selection of one of five poly (A) sites (L1-L5) that code for the major structural proteins of Adenovirus. During the early stage of infection, steady state mRNA is primarily derived from the L1 poly (A) site. During the late stage of infection, each of the MLTU poly (A) sites is represented in the steady state mRNA pool (Falck-Pedersen, E., Logan, J., 1989. Regulation of poly(A) site selection in adenovirus. J. Virol. 63 (2), 532-541.). Using transient transfection of a plasmid expressing Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase with a tandem poly (A) minigene system (L13) (DeZazzo, J.D., Falck-Pedersen, E., Imperiale, M.J., 1991.

Sequence elements upstream of the 3' cleavage site confer substrate strength to the adenovirus L1 and L3 polyadenylation sites. Mol. Cell. Biol. 14 (7), 4682-4693.), it has been demonstrated that the promoter-proximal L1 poly (A) site which is poorly recognized by the 3' end processing machinery, contains an upstream repressor element (URE) that influences steady state levels of mRNA (Prescott, J.C., Liu, L., Falck-Pedersen, E., 1997. Sequence-mediated regulation of adenovirus gene expression by repression of mRNA accumulation. Mol. Cell. Biol. 17 (4), 2207-2216.). In this study, we have further characterized the elements that mediate L1URE function. These studies indicate that the L1 upstream regulatory element (L1 URE) contains a complex RNA architecture that serves to repress gene expression through multiple sub-effectors. The L1URE functions when located upstream of a heterologous poly (A) site, and is able to strongly suppress steady state mRNA expression from the MLTU L3 poly (A) site or the murine beta-globin poly (A) site. In the tandem L13 mini-gene system, the L1URE is revealed to influence steady state mRNA stability, and subdomains within L1URE influence both gene expression and the steady state ratio of transcripts processed at proximal versus distal poly (A) sites. Transcript and gene repression mediated by the L1URE may provide a general strategy employed by adenovirus to block premature expression of late stage MLTU transcripts."

Transposable elements (TEs) are often enriched upstream of those CYP450s involved in insecticide resistance, leading to the assumption that they contribute regulatory motifs that directly underlie the resistance phenotype. A partial CuRE1 (Culex Repetitive Element 1) transposable element is found directly upstream of CYP9M10, a cytochrome P450 implicated previously in larval resistance to permethrin in the ISOP450 strain of Culex quinquefasciatus, but is absent from the equivalent genomic region of a susceptible strain. Via expression of CYP9M10 in Escherichia coli we have now demonstrated time- and NADPH-dependant permethrin metabolism, prerequisites for confirmation of a role in metabolic resistance, and through qPCR shown that CYP9M10 is >20-fold over-expressed in ISOP450 compared to a susceptible strain. In a fluorescent reporter assay the region upstream of CYP9M10 from ISOP450 drove 10× expression compared to the equivalent region (lacking CuRE1) from the susceptible strain. Close correspondence with the gene expression fold-change implicates the upstream region including CuRE1 as a cis-regulatory element involved in resistance. Only a single CuRE1 bearing allele, identical to the CuRE1 bearing allele in the resistant strain, is found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, in contrast to the diversity encountered in non-CuRE1 alleles. This suggests a single origin and subsequent spread due to selective advantage. CuRE1 is detectable using a simple diagnostic. When applied to C. quinquefasciatus larvae from Ghana we have demonstrated a significant association with permethrin resistance in multiple field sites (mean Odds Ratio = 3.86) suggesting this marker has relevance to natural populations of vector mosquitoes. However, when CuRE1 was excised from the allele used in the reporter assay through fusion PCR, expression was unaffected, indicating that the TE has no direct role in resistance and hence that CuRE1 is acting only as a marker of an as yet unidentified regulatory motif in the association analysis. This suggests that a re-evaluation of the assumption that TEs contribute regulatory motifs involved in gene expression may be necessary."

Here, we screened for NS4B-associated membrane proteins by tandem affinity purification and proteome analysis and identified 202 host proteins. Subsequent screening of replicon cells with small interfering RNA identified prolactin regulatory element binding (PREB) to be a novel HCV host cofactor. The interaction between PREB and NS4B was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assays. PREB colocalized with double-stranded RNA and the newly synthesized HCV RNA labeled with bromouridine triphosphate in HCV replicon cells. Furthermore, PREB shifted to detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), where HCV replication complexes reside, in the presence of NS4B expression in Huh7 cells. However, a PREB mutant lacking the NS4B-binding region (PREBd3) could not colocalize with double-stranded RNA and did not shift to the DRM in the presence of NS4B. These results indicate that PREB locates at the HCV replication complex by interacting with NS4B. PREB silencing inhibited the formation of the membranous HCV replication compartment and increased the protease and nuclease sensitivity of HCV replicase proteins and RNA in DRMs, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that PREB promotes HCV RNA replication by participating in the formation of the membranous replication compartment and by maintaining its proper structure by interacting with NS4B. Furthermore, PREB was induced by HCV infection in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide new insights into HCV host cofactors."

The core 2 GnT gene has six exons and produces three alternatively spliced transcripts. Gsl5 regulates only the expression of the kidney-type mRNA, which is transcribed from the most 5'-upstream exon. By introducing a 159-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone that carries the mouse core 2 GnT gene and its 5'-upstream region into DBA/2 mice that carry a defective Gsl5 allele, we were able to rescue the deficient phenotype. The BAC clone was subsequently engineered to replace the core 2 GnT gene with the sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter by an inducible homologous recombination system in Escherichia coli. The transgenic mice derived from the modified BAC clone expressed EGFP in the kidney, which suggests that the candidate Gsl5 is in the 5'-upstream region of the core 2 GnT gene. Sequence analysis of the 5'-upstream regions of the BAC clone and DBA/2 genomic DNA revealed a candidate sequence for Gsl5 at about 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1. This sequence consisted of eight repeats of two GT-rich units in the wild-type mice, whereas it consisted of only one pair of GT-rich units with a minor modification in the DBA/2 mice. Transgenic mice produced with the EGFP reporter gene construct that included this candidate sequence expressed EGFP exclusively in the proximal straight tubular cells of the kidney. These results indicated that this unique repeat is indeed the Gsl5, and it is a cis-regulatory element responsible for proximal straight tubule cell-specific transcriptional regulation."

Here we showed that the nuclear, mature SREBP-1c level increases in the nucleus of replicon cells expressing HCV-3a nonstructural protein-5A (NS5A). We further showed that HCV-3a NS5A up-regulates SREBP-1c transcription. Additional analysis showed that transcriptional factor Sp1 is involved in SREBP-1c activation by HCV-3a NS5A because inhibition of Sp1 activity by mithramycin A or a dominant-negative Sp1 construct abrogated SREBP-1c promoter activation by HCV-3a NS5A. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated enhanced binding of Sp1 on the SREBP-1c promoter in HCV-3a NS5A replicon cells. These results showed that HCV-3a NS5A activates SREBP-1c transcription through Sp1.

Plasma TG concentrations were significantly less in APOE2 mice orally administered MOEO (12.5 μg/d) for 2 wk than in the vehicle-treated group. Cellular TG and cholesterol concentrations were also significantly decreased in a dose- (400 and 800 mg/L) and time- (12 and 24 h) dependent manner in HepG2 cells stimulated with MOEO compared with controls. Mouse hepatic transcriptome analysis suggested MOEO feeding altered several lipid metabolic pathways, including bile acid and cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. In HepG2 cells, the rate of fatty acid oxidation, as assessed using [1-(14)C]palmitate, was unaltered; however, the rate of fatty acid synthesis quantified with [1-(14)C]acetate was significantly reduced by treatment with 400 and 800 mg/L MOEO compared with untreated controls. This reduction was due to the decreased expression of SREBP-1c and its responsive genes in fatty acid synthesis, including FAS, SCD1, and ACC1. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further demonstrated that the binding of p300/CBP-associated factor, a coactivator of SREBP-1c, and histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation at the FAS, SCD1, and ACC1 promoters were significantly reduced in the livers of APOE2 mice and HepG2 cells treated with MOEO compared with their controls. Additionally, MOEO stimulation in HepG2 cells induced bile acid synthesis and reduced the nuclear form of SREBP-2, a key transcription factor in hepatic cholesterol synthesis.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been shown to require the induction of lipogenesis. Here we show that the induction of lipogenesis and expression of key lipogenic enzymes in human fibroblasts occurs by 24 h post-HCMV infection. This activation correlates with increased cleavage of the SREBP1 precursors to form the mature active transcription factors that enter the nucleus to transcriptionally activate lipogenic genes. SREBP1 cleavage is normally inhibited by increased sterol levels; however, our data show that this level of control is overridden in infected cells to allow constitutive activation of lipogenesis. This process requires viral protein synthesis, since UV-irradiated HCMV cannot activate SREBP cleavage. The cleavage of SREBP1 requires it to be in complex with SREBP cleavage activation protein (SCAP). Depleting SCAP using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed that SREBP1 cleavage and the induction of lipogenic genes and lipid synthesis are all inhibited in HCMV-infected cells. As a result, production of infectious virions is reduced in SCAP-depleted cells. Thus, the SCAP-mediated mechanism for SREBP cleavage is utilized by HCMV during infection. Our studies suggest that HCMV induces adipocyte-like lipogenesis and overrides normal sterol feedback controls in order to maintain high levels of constitutive lipid synthesis during infection."

PFR2 mRNA levels are 10-fold lower in the mammalian stage than in the insect stage. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that the change in PFR2 mRNA abundance is achieved posttranscriptionally. Deletion and block substitution analysis of the entire 1,400-nucleotide 3' untranslated region (UTR) of PFR2C led to the identification of a regulatory element contained within 10 nucleotides of the 3' UTR, termed the PFR regulatory element (PRE), that is necessary for the 10-fold regulation of PFR2 mRNA levels. Comparison of the half-lives of PFR2 transcripts, identical except for the presence or absence of the PRE, revealed that the PRE acts by destabilizing the PFR2 mRNA in amastigotes. The PRE was inserted into a construct which directs the constitutive expression of a chimeric PFR2 transcript. Insertion of the PRE resulted in regulated expression of this transcript, demonstrating that the regulatory element is sufficient for promastigote-specific expression. Since the PRE is present in the 3' UTR of all L. mexicana PFR genes examined so far, we propose that it serves a means of coordinating expression of PFR genes."

The aim of this study is to examine the effect of leptin on SREBP-1c gene expression in HSCs in vitro and in vivo and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results of the present study demonstrated that leptin strongly inhibited SREBP-1c expression in HSCs in vivo and in vitro. p38 MAPK was involved in leptin regulation of SREBP-1c expression in cultured HSCs. Leptin-induced activation of p38 MAPK led to the decreases in liver X receptor (LXR)-α protein level, activity and its binding to the SREBP-1c promoter, which caused the downregulation of SREBP-1c expression. Moreover, leptin inhibition of SREBP-1c expression via p38 MAPK increased the expression of alpha1(I) collagen in HSCs. Our results might provide new insights into the mechanisms of the unique role of leptin in the development of liver fibrosis and might have potential implications for clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis in diseases in which circulating leptin levels are elevated such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and alcoholic cirrhosis."

Enhancers convey these properties through diverse mechanisms, including long-distance interactions with target promoters via their association with specific transcription factors. Despite unprecedented progress in the knowledge of enhancer mechanisms of action, there are still many unanswered questions. In particular, the contribution of an enhancer's local chromatin configuration to its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Here we describe a novel regulatory element, the Upstream Enhancer Element (UEE), which modulates the activity of the chicken α-globin 3' enhancer by regulating its chromatin structure, specifically by positioning a nucleosome upstream of the core enhancer. This element binds nuclear factors and confers a more restricted activation on the α-globin 3' enhancer, suggesting a progressive/rheostatic model for enhancer activity. Our results suggest that the UEE activity contributes to the positioning of a nucleosome that is necessary for the α-globin 3' enhancer activation. "

In case of IGF2, it is generally accepted that loss of imprinting in a differentially methylated region of the IGF2/H19 locus results in biallelic expression and, thus, upregulation of the gene. In this study we examined methylation pattern at potential regulatory elements of the paternally expressed NNAT gene in a cohort of WT patients in order to further characterize the molecular mechanism causing overexpression of this regulatory gene. We demonstrate that transcriptional upregulation of NNAT in WT is grossly independent of the bladder cancer-associated protein (BLCAP) gene, an imprinted gene within the imprinted domain of the NNAT locus. However, expression of the BLCAP transcript isoform v2a formerly known to be selectively expressed from the paternal allele in brain was associated with high expression of NNAT. This contrasts the situation we found at the IGF2/H19 locus, which shows high overexpression of IGF2 and inversely correlated expression of the H19 gene in WT. An analysis of DNA methylation in two potential regulatory regions of the NNAT locus by pyrosequencing revealed significant hypomethylation of the tumors compared to normal kidney tissue. Interestingly, the difference in DNA methylation was highest at CpGs that were observed within three putative binding sites of the CCCTC-binding factor CTCF. Most importantly, hypomethylation of both NNAT regulatory regions is significantly associated with the upregulation of NNAT expression and the BLCAP_v2a transcript. Our data indicate that the methylation status of a not-yet-described regulatory element within the NNAT locus that contains four potential CTCF binding sites determines the expression level of NNAT and the nearby located BLCAP_v2a transcript, thereby suggesting a functional role in the aberrant upregulation of NNAT in WT.

We searched for additional regulatory elements in this region by using a luciferase reporter assay and nucleotide sequence analysis. Within 8 kb 3' of Calpha13, we identified a 1-kb fragment that negatively regulated the hs1,2 enhancement of the Ialpha promoter. This negative regulatory element, Calpha-NRE, contains a conserved 300-bp region that is associated with 8 of the 13 germ line Calpha genes. This conserved region contains an E box that, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, binds an E47-like protein. At the 5' end, Calpha-NRE also includes a 270-bp region with 20-bp repeats nearly identical to those 3' of mouse and human Calpha genes, and these repeats bind unidentified nuclear protein(s). Calpha-NRE appears to be a novel regulatory element that may contribute to the regulation of IgH gene expression."

Such coevolution has been invoked to explain experimental results, but has rarely been the focus of study. Conserved expression driven by the unc-47 promoters of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae persists despite divergence within a cis-regulatory element and between this element and the trans-regulatory environment. Compensatory changes in cis and trans are revealed when these promoters are used to drive expression in the other species. Functional changes in the C. briggsae promoter, which has experienced accelerated sequence evolution, did not lead to alteration of gene expression in its endogenous environment. Coevolution among promoter elements suggests that complex epistatic interactions within cis-regulatory elements may facilitate their divergence. Our results offer a detailed picture of regulatory evolution in which subtle, lineage-specific, and compensatory modifications of interacting cis and trans regulators together maintain conserved gene expression patterns."

Due to the eminent complexity of the regulatory mechanism, the combinatorics of CRE-mediated transcriptional regulation has been elusive. In this work, we have developed a new methodology that quantifies the co-occurrence tendencies of CREs present in a set of promoter sequences; these co-occurrence scores are filtered in three consecutive steps to test their statistical significance; and the significantly co-occurring CRE pairs are presented as networks. These networks of co-occurring CREs are further transformed to derive higher order of regulatory combinatorics. We have further applied this methodology on the differentially up-regulated gene-sets of rice tissues under fungal (Magnaporthe) infected conditions to demonstrate how it helps to understand the CRE-mediated combinatorial gene regulation. Our analysis includes a wide spectrum of biologically important results. The CRE pairs having a strong tendency to co-occur often exhibit very similar joint distribution patterns at the promoters of rice. We couple the network approach with experimental results of plant gene regulation and defense mechanisms and find evidences of auto and cross regulation among TF families, cross-talk among multiple hormone signaling pathways, similarities and dissimilarities in regulatory combinatorics between different tissues, etc. Our analyses have pointed a highly distributed nature of the combinatorial gene regulation facilitating an efficient alteration in response to fungal attack. All together, our proposed methodology could be an important approach in understanding the combinatorial gene regulation. It can be further applied to unravel the tissue and/or condition specific combinatorial gene regulation in other eukaryotic systems with the availability of annotated genomic sequences and suitable experimental data.

ERK-dependent phosphorylation causes an increase in their transcriptional activity, whereas SUMO modification halts it. We hypothesized a causal linkage between phosphorylation and sumoylation because their sites are very closely located in SREBP-1 and -2 molecules. When Ser(455), a phosphorylation site in SREBP-2, was substituted with Ala, this SREBP-2 mutant was more efficiently modified by SUMO-1. On the other hand, substitution of Asp inhibited SUMO conjugation, mimicking phosphoserine. When cells were cultured with insulin-like growth factor-1, sumoylation of SREBP-2 was decreased with an increase in its phosphorylation, but SREBP-2(S455A) was continuously sumoylated. An ERK cascade inhibitor, U0126, inversely augmented SUMO modification of SREBP-2. Insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment stimulated the expression of SREBP target genes such as the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, squalene synthase, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase genes. These results indicate that growth factor-induced phosphorylation of SREBP-2 inhibits sumoylation, thereby facilitating SREBP transcriptional activity. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays revealed that wild-type SREBP-2, but not a mutant lacking Lys(464), interacts with HDAC3 preferentially among the histone deacetylase family members. HDAC3 small interfering RNA induced gene expression of the LDL receptor and thereby augmented fluorescently labeled LDL uptake in HepG2 cells. In summary, growth factors inhibit sumoylation of SREBPs through their phosphorylation, thus avoiding the recruitment of an HDAC3 corepressor complex and stimulating the lipid uptake and synthesis required for cell growth."

With the use of transiently transfected human intestinal epithelial HuTu 80 cells and 5'-deletion analysis, the minimal SLC52A3 promoter was found to be encoded between -199 and +8 bp (using the start of the transcription start site as position 1). Although several putative cis-regulatory elements were predicted in this region, only the stimulating protein-1 (Sp1) binding site (at position -74/-71 bp) was found to play a role in promoter activity, as indicated by mutational analysis. Binding of Sp1 to the minimal SLC52A3 promoter was demonstrated by means of EMSA and supershift assays and by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Studies with Drosophila SL2 cells (which lack Sp activity) confirmed the importance of Sp1 in driving the activity of the SLC52A3 minimal promoter; they further showed that Sp3 can also do the activation. Finally, with the use of luciferase gene fusions, the activity of the cloned SLC52A3 promoter was confirmed in vivo in transgenic mice.

Using luciferase reporter gene constructs in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells), we demonstrated that the full effect of insulin requires the presence of SREs (sterol response elements) in the proximal region of the promoter. Furthermore, insulin increases the binding of SREBP-1 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1) to this promoter region in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We also found that the nuclear receptors LXRs (liver X receptors) strongly activate SREBP-1c gene expression and identified the LXRE (LXR-response element) involved in this effect. However, our results suggested that these LXREs do not play a major role in the response to insulin. Finally, using expression vectors and adenoviruses allowing ectopic overexpressions of the human mature forms of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c, we demonstrated the direct role of SREBP-1 in the control of SREBP-1c gene expression in human skeletal-muscle cells. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the SREBP-1 transcription factors are the main mediators of insulin action on SREBP-1c expression in human tissues."

In this study, we sought to investigate the role of cAMP signaling in regulating DGKθ gene expression. Real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) increased the mRNA and protein expression, respectively, of DGKθ in H295R human adrenocortical cells.

Mechanistic studies showed that ethanol-mediated induction of lipin-1 gene expression was inhibited by a known activator of AMPK or overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK. Importantly, overexpression of the processed nuclear form of SREBP-1c abolished the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside to suppress ethanol-mediated induction of lipin-1 gene-expression level.

The mechanism of fission yeast SREBP cleavage is less well defined and, in contrast, requires the Golgi-localized Dsc E3 ligase complex. The Dsc E3 ligase consists of five integral membrane subunits, Dsc1 through Dsc5, and resembles membrane E3 ligases that function in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Using immunoprecipitation assays and blue native electrophoresis, we determined the subunit architecture for the complex of Dsc1 through Dsc5, showing that the Dsc proteins form subcomplexes and display defined connectivity. Dsc2 is a rhomboid pseudoprotease family member homologous to mammalian UBAC2 and a central component of the Dsc E3 ligase. We identified conservation in the architecture of the Dsc E3 ligase and the multisubunit E3 ligase gp78 in mammals. Specifically, Dsc1-Dsc2-Dsc5 forms a complex resembling gp78-UBAC2-UBXD8. Further characterization of Dsc2 revealed that its C-terminal UBA domain can bind to ubiquitin chains but that the Dsc2 UBA domain is not essential for yeast SREBP cleavage. Based on the ability of rhomboid superfamily members to bind transmembrane proteins, we speculate that Dsc2 functions in SREBP recognition and binding. Homologs of Dsc1 through Dsc4 are required for SREBP cleavage and virulence in the human opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Thus, these studies advance our organizational understanding of multisubunit E3 ligases involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and fungal pathogenesis. "

Capsid proteins, and hence mature virions, are produced in the outermost layer of differentiated cells. As late gene transcripts are produced in the lower layers, posttranscriptional mechanisms likely prevent capsid protein production in less differentiated cells. For HPV type 16 (HPV-16), a 79-nucleotide (nt) negative regulatory element (NRE) inhibits gene expression in basal epithelial cells. To identify key NRE sequences, we carried out transient transfection in basal epithelial cells with reporter constructs containing the HPV-16 late 3' untranslated region with deletions and mutations of the NRE. Reporter gene expression was increased over 40-fold by deletion of the entire element, 10-fold by deletion of the 5' portion of the NRE that contains four weak consensus 5' splice sites, and only 3-fold by deletion of the 3' GU-rich region. Both portions of the element appear to be necessary for full repression. Inactivating mutations in the 5' splice sites in the 5' NRE partially alleviated repression in the context of the 79-nt NRE but caused full derepression when assayed in a construct with the 3' NRE deleted. All four contribute to the inhibitory effect, though the second splice site is most inhibitory. Sm proteins, U1A and U1 snRNA, but not U1 70K, could be affinity purified with the wild-type NRE but not with the NRE containing mutations in the 5' splice sites, indicating that a U1 snRNP-like complex forms upon the element."

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene), SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability. "

Luciferase assay and qRT-PCR showed that c.2327A>G polymorphism in the 3'-UTR exerts a strong regulatory role in FSHR transcription. This regulatory role is achieved by affecting FSHR mRNA decay. Furthermore, the c.2327A>G mutation in the 3'-UTR influences ARE (AU-rich element, a cis-acting element promoting mRNA decay)-mediated mRNA decay of Hu sheep FSHR gene. Together, our study identified a novel polymorphism and elucidated a new mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of FSHR in mammals."

Many of these viruses manipulate host cholesterol metabolism to facilitate their replication. HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T cells activates the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) transcriptional program, which includes genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. However, the role of SREBP2-dependent transcription in HIV-1 biology has not been fully examined. Here, we identify TFII-I, a gene critical for HIV-1 transcription in activated T cells, as a novel SREBP2 target gene. We found TFII-I expression increased after HIV-1 infection or activation of human primary CD4(+) T cells. We show that inhibition of SREBP2 activity reduced TFII-I induction in response to these stimuli. More importantly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of either SREBP2 or TFII-I significantly reduced HIV-1 production in CD4(+) T cells. We also found that TFII-I potentiates Tat-dependent viral gene expression, consistent with a role at the level of HIV-1 transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that HIV-1 transcription in T cells is linked to cholesterol homeostasis through control of TFII-I expression by SREBP2."

Prolactin regulatory element-binding protein (PREB) gene cloned as a candidate transcription factor binds to VRE. Increases of mRNA levels of PRL and PREB during embryogenesis were identified. However, whether VIP affects levels of PRL and PREB mRNA during embryogenesis remains unknown. The effects of VIP and forskolin on mRNA expression of PRL and PREB in the embryonic anterior pituitary gland were assessed. Furthermore, administration of VIP to laying hens was conducted to examine the relationship between VIP and PREB mRNA expression. At day 14 of the embryonic growth stage, VIP treatment did not affect mRNA levels of either PRL or PREB, whereas forskolin treatment induced the increase of these mRNA levels. At day 20, both VIP and forskolin induced an increase of PRL and PREB mRNA levels. The administration of VIP significantly increased mRNA levels of PRL and PREB in the anterior pituitary gland of White Leghorn and Nagoya.

This led to the notion that the 3'RR orchestrates the IgH locus activity at late stages of B cell maturation only. However, long-range interactions involving the 3'RR were detected in early B cells, but the functional consequences of these interactions were unknown. Here we show that not only does the 3'RR affect transcription at distant sites within the IgH variable region but also it conveys a transcriptional silencing activity on both sense and antisense transcription. The 3'RR-mediated silencing activity is switched off upon completion of VH-DJH recombination. Our findings reveal a developmentally controlled, stage-dependent shift in the transcriptional activity of a master regulatory element. "

A diet supplemented with Zetia (ezetimibe) and lovastatin increased and decreased nuclear SREBP-2 and SREBP-1, respectively, whereas a fasting/refeeding protocol dramatically altered SREBP-1 but had modest effects on SREBP-2 levels. Binding of both SREBP-1 and -2 increased on promoters for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, fatty-acid synthase, and squalene synthase in livers of Zetia/lovastatin-treated mice despite the decline in total SREBP-1 protein. In contrast, only SREBP-2 binding was increased for the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter. Decreased SREBP-1 binding during fasting and a dramatic increase upon refeeding indicates that the lipogenic ""overshoot"" for fatty-acid synthase gene expression known to occur during high carbohydrate refeeding can be attributed to a similar overshoot in SREBP-1 binding. SREBP co-regulatory protein recruitment was also increased/decreased in parallel with associated changes in SREBP binding, and there were clear distinctions for different promoters in response to the dietary manipulations. Taken together, these studies reveal that there are alternative molecular mechanisms for activating SREBP target genes in response to the different dietary challenges of Zetia/lovastatin versus fasting/refeeding. This underscores the mechanistic flexibility that has evolved at the individual gene/promoter level to maintain metabolic homeostasis in response to shifting nutritional states and environmental fluctuations."

The mechanism for its cardiac-restricted expression is not yet fully understood. We previously identified a purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element in the first intron of the gene, which is essential for its cardiac-specific expression (Gupta, M., Zak, R., Libermann, T. A., and Gupta, M. P. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 7243-7258). In this study we cloned and characterized muscle and non-muscle factors that bind to this element. We show that two single-stranded DNA-binding proteins of the PUR family, PURalpha and PURbeta, which are derived from cardiac myocytes, bind to the plus strand of the PNR element. In functional assays, PURalpha and PURbeta repressed alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) gene expression in the presence of upstream regulatory sequences of the gene. However, from HeLa cells an Ets family of protein, Ets-related protein (ERP), binds to double-stranded PNR element. The ERP.PNR complex inhibited the activity of the basal transcription complex from homologous as well as heterologous promoters in a PNR position-independent manner, suggesting that ERP acts as a silencer of alpha-MHC gene expression in non-muscle cells. We also show that PUR proteins are capable of binding to alpha-MHC mRNA and attenuate its translational efficiency. Furthermore, we show robust expression of PUR proteins in failing hearts where alpha-MHC mRNA levels are suppressed. Together, these results reveal that (i) PUR proteins participate in transcriptional as well as translational regulation of alpha-MHC expression in cardiac myocytes and (ii) ERP may be involved in cardiac-restricted expression of the alpha-MHC gene by preventing its expression in non-muscle cells."

Here we report the biological function of NAC103 in a novel transcriptional regulatory cascade, connecting bZIP60 to the UPR downstream genes in Arabidopsis. Expression of NAC103 was induced by ER stress, and was completely abolished in the bZIP60 null mutant. A new ER stress-responsive cis-element UPRE-III (TCATCG) on the NAC103 promoter was identified, and trans-activation of UPRE-III by bZIP60 was confirmed in both yeast cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts. The direct binding of bZIP60 to UPRE-III-containing DNA was also demonstrated in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NAC103 formed homodimers in yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. It had transcriptional activation activity and was localized in the nucleus. Over-expression of NAC103 had pleiotropic effects on plant growth, and induced expression of several UPR downstream genes in Arabidopsis under normal growth conditions. The activation of UPR gene promoters by NAC103 was also confirmed in effector/reporter protoplast assays. Thus, our study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory cascade in which NAC103 relays ER stress signals from bZIP60 to UPR downstream genes through a newly identified ER stress cis-element (UPRE-III) and transcriptional activation activity of its encoded protein NAC103.

The sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) known to regulate the transcription of lipogenic genes together with SREBF chaperone and insulin induced gene 1 were the candidate genes. The results showed significant association of the overall SREBF1 haplotypes with milk production and variations in lauric (12:0) and myristic (14:0) acid concentrations in milk. Haplotype H1 of SREBF1 was the most desirable to improve milk healthfulness because it was significantly associated with lower lauric (12:0) and myristic (14:0) acid concentrations compared with haplotype H3 of SREBF1, and lower lauric acid (12:0) concentration compared with haplotype H2 of SREBF1. Haplotype H1 of SREBF1, however, was significantly associated with lower milk production compared with haplotype H3 of SREBF1. We did not detect any significant associations between genetic polymorphisms in insulin induced gene 1 (INSIG1) and SREBF chaperone and milk fatty acid composition. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in SREBF1 can be used to develop genetic tools for the selection of animals producing milk with healthier fatty acid composition."

In contrast, few such conserved elements can be detected between vertebrates and their closest invertebrate relatives. Despite this lack of sequence identity, cross-species transgenesis has identified some cases where non-coding DNA from invertebrates drives reporter gene expression in transgenic vertebrates in patterns reminiscent of the expression of vertebrate orthologues. Such instances are presumed to reflect the presence of conserved suites of binding sites in the regulatory regions of invertebrate and vertebrate orthologues, such that both regulatory elements can correctly interpret the trans-activating environment. Shuffling of binding sites has been suggested to lie behind loss of sequence conservation; however this has not been experimentally tested. Here we examine the underlying basis of enhancer activity for the Ciona intestinalis βγ-crystallin gene, which drives expression in the lens of transgenic vertebrates despite the Ciona lineage predating the evolution of the lens. We construct an interactive gene regulatory network (GRN) for vertebrate lens development, allowing network interactions to be robustly catalogued and conserved network components and features to be identified. We show that a small number of binding motifs are necessary for Ciona βγ-crystallin expression, and narrow down the likely factors that bind to these motifs. Several of these overlap with the conserved core of the vertebrate lens GRN, implicating these sites in cross species function. However when we test these motifs in a transgenic vertebrate they prove to be dispensable for reporter expression in the lens. These results show that current models depicting cross species enhancer function as dependent on conserved binding sites can be overly simplistic, with sound evolutionary inference requiring detailed dissection of underlying mechanisms.

Supplemented PUFA were also metabolised to longer and more unsaturated species. These processing activities were higher for n-3 than n-6 PUFA (P < 0.01). We studied the effect of PUFA on the intracellular distribution of non-esterified cholesterol, using filipin staining and fluorescence microscopy with or without the cholesterol traffic blocker U18666A. The data show that the incorporation of PUFA increases non-esterified cholesterol flow from the plasma membrane to intracellular membranes.

We have determined that Srb1 message levels increase in a time dependent manner during growth under oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). To further understand the role of Srb1 during infection and hypoxia, we silenced the gene encoding Srb1 using RNA interference (RNAi); characterized the resulting phenotype, determined its response to hypoxia, and its ability to cause disease within an infected host. Silencing of Srb1 resulted in a strain of H. capsulatum that is incapable of surviving in vitro hypoxia. We found that without complete Srb1 expression, H. capsulatum is killed by murine macrophages and avirulent in mice given a lethal dose of yeasts. Additionally, silencing Srb1 inhibited the hypoxic upregulation of other known H. capsulatum hypoxia-responsive genes (HRG), and genes that encode ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes. Consistent with these regulatory functions, Srb1 silenced H. capsulatum cells were hypersensitive to the antifungal azole drug itraconazole. These data support the theory that the H. capsulatum SREBP is critical for hypoxic adaptation and is required for H. capsulatum virulence."

PREB is expressed not only in the pituitary but also in various other tissues, including the adipose tissue. Previous studies have shown that PREB acts as a transcriptional regulator and suppresses the expression of the adiponectin gene in cultured 3T3L1 preadipocytes. The aim of this study was to further examine the potential role of PREB in adipose tissue in vivo."

The elevated level of α2M mRNA has been described in replicative senescence and it could be used as a biomarker of the aging cells. However, the mechanism responsible for the up-regulation of its expression is still unclear. This report identified a novel transcriptional regulatory element, the α2M transcription enhancement element (ATEE), within the α2M promoter. This element differentially activates α2M expression in senescent versus young fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed abundant complexes in senescent cell nuclear extracts compared with young cell nuclear extracts. The DNase I footprint revealed the protein-binding core sequence through which the protein binds the ATEE. Mutation within ATEE selectively abolished α2M promoter activity in senescent (but not young) cells. These results indicated the ATEE, as a positive transcription regulatory element, contributes to the up-regulation of α2M during replicative senescence."

However, to date, the regulatory mechanisms underlying auxin-mediated plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi symbiosis have not been well deciphered. Previously we identified a GH3 gene, SlGH3.4, strongly responsive to both auxin induction and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we reported a refined dissection of the SlGH3.4 promoter activity using the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter. The SlGH3.4 promoter could drive GUS expression strongly in mycorrhizal roots of soybean and rice plants, and in IAA-treated soybean roots, but not in IAA-treated rice roots. A promoter deletion assay revealed three cis-acting motifs, i.e. the auxin-responsive element, AuxRE, and two newly identified motifs named MYCRS1 and MYCRS2, involved in the activation of auxin- and AM-mediated expression of SlGH3.4. Deletion of the AuxRE from the SlGH3.4 promoter caused almost complete abolition of GUS staining in response to external IAA induction. Seven repeats of AuxRE fused to the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S minimal promoter could direct GUS expression in both IAA-treated and AM fungal-colonized roots of tobacco plants. Four repeats of MYCRS1 or MYCRS2 fused to the CaMV35S minimal promoter was sufficient to drive GUS expression in arbuscule-containing cells, but not in IAA-treated tobacco roots. In summary, our results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential cross-talk between the auxin and the AM regulatory pathways in modulating the expression of AM-responsive GH3 genes in diverse mycorrhizal plants."

To search for positive-acting regulatory sequences, we isolated genomic clones spanning the mouse elastin gene and extensive 5'- and 3'-flanking regions. Restriction fragments of potential regulatory regions were ligated 5' or 3' relative to the active promoter to test for enhancer activity in transient transfections of fetal rat lung fibroblasts, which express elastin at high levels, and distal lung epithelial cells, which do not express detectable elastin. Fragments of intron 1 did not exhibit significant enhancer activity. Inclusion of the 84-bp exon 1 and adjacent 5'-untranslated region increased activity of the elastin promoter approximately sixfold compared with parental constructs. Transfections with constructs of varying promoter length showed that as little as 40 bp of the 5' end of exon 1 confers enhanced activity in elastin-expressing rat lung fibroblasts, but these constructs had variable activity in lung epithelial cell lines. This region, localized between the transcription start site and extending into exon 1, binds Sp1 in nuclear extracts from elastin-expressing cells. These studies indicate a role for the 5' end of the first exon of the elastin gene in regulating strong transcriptional activity in elastogenic cells."

Previous comparative studies of gene expression have largely measured the abundance of messenger RNA, which is affected by post-transcriptional regulatory processes, hence limiting inferences about the mechanisms underlying expression differences. Here, we directly measured nascent transcription in primate species, allowing us to separate transcription from post-transcriptional regulation. We used precision run-on and sequencing to map RNA polymerases in resting and activated CD4"

During this process, pioneer factors establish an accessible chromatin state to facilitate additional transcription factor binding, yet it remains unclear how different pioneer factors achieve this. Here, we discover that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds chromatin to shape accessibility, transcription factor co-binding, and regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. Furthermore, the requirement for BRG1 in shaping OCT4 binding reflects how these target sites are used during cellular reprogramming and early mouse development. Together this reveals a distinct requirement for a chromatin remodeller in promoting the activity of the pioneer factor OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network."

We found that a 2.4 kb regulatory DNA fragment upstream of the 3,17β-HSD gene (βhsd) responds to steroids and triggers βhsd gene induction. To exploit this cis-acting regulatory element for a steroid determination system, plasmids pK2.4-EGFP-4 and pBB2.4-EGFP-8 were constructed. Both plasmids contain the EGFP gene fused downstream to a 2.4 kb DNA fragment from C. testosteroni. However, whereas pK2.4-EGFP-4 could integrate into the chromosomal DNA of C. testosteroni and knock out the βhsd gene promoter, pBB2.4-EGFP-8 could replicate in C. testosteroni cells as a free plasmid DNA. After integration of pK2.4-EGFP-4 into the βhsd gene promoter, 3,17β-HSD expression could not be induced such that EGFP expression in the mutant cells was at low levels. In contrast, in C. testosteroni cells transformed with pBB2.4-EGFP-8 the expression of EGFP was induced with testosterone. Our results showed that fluorescence counts (relative fluorescence units; RFU) increased in parallel with testosterone concentrations. Of note, estradiol and cholesterol could not induce the EGFP reporter gene. In summary, this new biosensor system might be used for the specific determination of testosterone."
