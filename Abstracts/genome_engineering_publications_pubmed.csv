Recent developments, including whole-cell models, genome design algorithms and gene editing tools, have advanced the possibility of combining biological research and mathematical modelling to further understand and better design cellular processes. In this review, we will explore computational and experimental approaches used for metabolic and genome design. We will highlight the relevance of modelling in this process, and challenges associated with the generation of quantitative predictions about cell behaviour as a whole: although many cellular processes are well understood at the subsystem level, it has proved a hugely complex task to integrate separate components together to model and study an entire cell. We explore these developments, highlighting where computational design algorithms compensate for missing cellular information and underlining where computational models can complement and reduce lab experimentation. We will examine issues and illuminate the next steps for genome engineering."

Synthesizing a genome from scratch allows modifications of the genomic structure and function to an extent that was hitherto not possible, which will finally lead to new insights into the basic principles of life and enable valuable applications. With several recent genome synthesis projects as examples, the technical details to synthesize a genome and applications of synthetic genome are addressed in this perspective. A series of ongoing or future synthetic genomics projects, including the different genomes to be synthesized in GP-write, synthetic minimal genome, massively recoded genome, chimeric genome and synthetic genome with expanded genetic alphabet, are also discussed here with a special focus on theoretical and technical impediments in the design and synthesis process. Synthetic genomics will become a commonplace to engineer pathways and genomes according to arbitrary sets of design principles with the development of high-efficient, low-cost genome synthesis and assembly technologies."

Here, we reported efficient genome engineering of an important industrial microorganism, Zymomonas mobilis, by repurposing the endogenous Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system upon its functional characterization. This toolkit included a series of genome engineering plasmids, each carrying an artificial self-targeting CRISPR and a donor DNA for the recovery of recombinants. Through this toolkit, various genome engineering purposes were efficiently achieved, including knockout of ZMO0038 (100% efficiency), cas2/3 (100%), and a genomic fragment of >10 kb (50%), replacement of cas2/3 with mCherry gene (100%), in situ nucleotide substitution (100%) and His-tagging of ZMO0038 (100%), and multiplex gene deletion (18.75%) upon optimal donor size determination. Additionally, the Type I-F system was further applied for CRISPRi upon Cas2/3 depletion, which has been demonstrated to successfully silence the chromosomally integrated mCherry gene with its fluorescence intensity reduced by up to 88%. Moreover, we demonstrated that genome engineering efficiency could be improved under a restriction-modification (R-M) deficient background, suggesting the perturbance of genome editing by other co-existing DNA targeting modules such as the R-M system. This study might shed light on exploiting and improving CRISPR-Cas systems in other microorganisms for genome editing and metabolic engineering practices."

The design of an optimal strain often requires the manipulation of metabolic and regulatory genes to different levels, such as overexpression, downregulation, and deletion. Unfortunately, few tools to achieve multiple functions simultaneously have been reported. Here, a dual-functional clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) (RE-CRISPR) system that combined genome editing and transcriptional repression was designed using a catalytically active Cas12a (a.k.a. Cpf1) in C. glutamicum. Firstly, gene deletion was achieved using Cas12a under a constitutive promoter. Then, via engineering of the guide RNA sequences, transcriptional repression was successfully achieved using a catalytically active Cas12a with crRNAs containing 15 or 16 bp spacer sequences, whose gene repression efficiency was comparable to that of the canonical system (deactivated Cas12a with full-length crRNAs). Finally, RE-CRISPR was developed to achieve genome editing and transcriptional repression simultaneously by transforming a single crRNA plasmid and Cas12a plasmid. The application of RE-CRISPR was demonstrated to increase the production of cysteine and serine for ~ 3.7-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, in a single step. This study expands the application of CRISPR/Cas12a-based genome engineering and provides a powerful synthetic biology tool for multiplex metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum."

The method enabled us to insert DNA fragments up to 12 kb into the genome and to delete DNA fragments up to 186.7 kb from the genome, with positive rates over 95%. We applied this method for E. coli genome simplification, resulting in 12 individual deletion mutants and four cumulative deletion mutants. The simplest genome lost a total of 370.6 kb of DNA sequence containing 364 open reading frames. Additionally, we applied this technique to metabolic engineering and obtained a genetically stable plasmid-independent isobutanol production strain that produced 1.3 g/L isobutanol via shake-flask fermentation.

Here we review and discuss the recent advances in bacterial genome manipulation and gene expression control techniques, and their actual uses with accompanying examples. Genome engineering has been commonly performed based on homologous recombination. During such genome manipulation, the counterselection systems employing SacB or nucleases have mainly been used for the efficient selection of desired engineered strains. The recombineering technology enables simple and more rapid manipulation of the bacterial genome. The group II intron-mediated genome engineering technology is another option for some bacteria that are difficult to be engineered by homologous recombination. Due to the increasing demands on high-throughput screening of bacterial strains having the desired phenotypes, several multiplex genome engineering techniques have recently been developed and validated in some bacteria. Another approach to achieve desired bacterial phenotypes is the repression of target gene expression without the modification of genome sequences. This can be performed by expressing antisense RNA, small regulatory RNA, or CRISPR RNA to repress target gene expression at the transcriptional or translational level. All of these techniques allow efficient and rapid development and screening of bacterial strains having desired phenotypes, and more advanced techniques are expected to be seen. "

Here we demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 system can effectively trigger programmable double strand break (DSB) at the chromosome of PCC 7942 and provoke cell death. With the co-transformation of template plasmid harboring the gene cassette and flanking homology arms, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DSB enabled precise gene integration, ameliorated the homologous recombination efficiency and allowed the use of lower amount of template DNA and shorter homology arms. The CRISPR-Cas9-induced cell death imposed selective pressure and enhanced the chance of concomitant integration of gene cassettes into all chromosomes of PCC 7942, hence accelerating the process of obtaining homogeneous and stable recombinant strains. We further explored the feasibility of engineering cyanobacteria by CRISPR-Cas9-assisted simultaneous glgc knock-out and gltA/ppc knock-in, which improved the succinate titer to 435.0±35.0μg/L, an ≈11-fold increase when compared with that of the wild-type cells.

Cyanobacteria pose unique challenges to genome engineering efforts because their cellular biology differs significantly from other eubacteria; therefore, tools developed for other genera are not directly transferrable. Standardized parts, such as promoters and ribosome binding sites, which control gene expression, require characterization in cyanobacteria in order to have fully predictable results.

Efficient targeted genome alterations are mainly based on the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or adjacent single-strand breaks (SSBs). Naturally, all organisms continuously have to deal with DNA-damaging factors challenging the genetic integrity, and therefore a wide range of DNA repair mechanisms have evolved. A profound understanding of the different repair pathways is a prerequisite to control and enhance targeted gene modifications. DSB repair can take place by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-dependent repair (HDR). As the main outcome of NHEJ-mediated repair is accompanied by small insertions and deletions, it is applicable to specifically knock out genes or to rearrange linkage groups or whole chromosomes. The basic requirement for HDR is the presence of a homologous template; thus this process can be exploited for targeted integration of ectopic sequences into the plant genome. The development of different types of artificial site-specific nucleases allows for targeted DSB induction in the plant genome. Such synthetic nucleases have been used for both qualitatively studying DSB repair in vivo with respect to mechanistic differences and quantitatively in order to determine the role of key factors for NHEJ and HR, respectively. The conclusions drawn from these studies allow for a better understanding of genome evolution and help identifying synergistic or antagonistic genetic interactions while supporting biotechnological applications for transiently modifying the plant DNA repair machinery in favor of targeted genome engineering."

However, there are often challenges such as their thermal instability that should be overcome before a newly discovered enzyme is eventually translated into industrial processes. In this work, we describe a roadmap for the development of a robust catalyst for industrial resolution of Vince lactam, a key intermediate for the synthesis of carbocyclic-nucleoside-related pharmaceuticals. By a genome mining strategy, a new (+)-γ-lactamase (MiteL) from Microbacterium testaceum was successfully discovered and biochemically characterized. In vitro studies showed that the enzyme exhibited high activity but poor enantioselectivity (E = 6.3 ± 0.2) toward racemic Vince lactam, and thus, it is not suitable for industrial applications. Based on structural modeling and docking studies, a semi-rational engineering strategy combined with an efficient screening method was then applied to improve the enantioselectivity of MiteL. Several mutants with significant shifting stereoselectivity toward (-)-γ-lactam were obtained by site-saturation mutagenesis. Synergy effects led to the final mutant F14D/Q114R/M117L, which enabled efficient acquisition of (-)-γ-lactam with a high E value (> 200). The mutant was biochemically characterized, and the docking studies suggested a plausible mechanism for its improved selectivity. Finally, a sunflower-like nanoreactor was successfully constructed to improve the mutant's robustness via protein supramolecular self-assembly. Thus, the synergism between semi-rational protein engineering and self-assembling immobilization enabled construction of a nanoreactor with superior properties, which can be used for resolution of Vince lactam in large scale."

In particular, the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been engineered to create site-specific double-strand breaks for genome editing or to direct targeted transcriptional regulation. A unique capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is multiplex genome engineering by delivering a single Cas9 enzyme and two or more single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeted to distinct genomic sites. This approach can be used to simultaneously create multiple DNA breaks or to target multiple transcriptional activators to a single promoter for synergistic enhancement of gene induction. To address the need for uniform and sustained delivery of multiplex CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering tools, we developed a single lentiviral system to express a Cas9 variant, a reporter gene and up to four sgRNAs from independent RNA polymerase III promoters that are incorporated into the vector by a convenient Golden Gate cloning method. Each sgRNA is efficiently expressed and can mediate multiplex gene editing and sustained transcriptional activation in immortalized and primary human cells. This delivery system will be significant to enabling the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome engineering in diverse cell types. "

The DSB is repaired by endogenous DNA repair pathways, either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR). The predominant and error-prone NHEJ pathway often results in small nucleotide insertions or deletions that can be used to construct knockout alleles. Alternatively, HDR activity can result in precise modification incorporating exogenous DNA fragments into the cut site. However, genetic recombination in mammalian systems through the HDR pathway is an inefficient process and requires cumbersome laboratory methods to identify the desired accurate insertion events. This is further compromised by the activity of the competing DNA repair pathway, NHEJ, which repairs the majority of nuclease induced DNA DSBs and also is responsible for mutagenic insertion and deletion events at off-target locations throughout the genome. Various methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of designer nuclease-based HDR mediated gene editing.

With this method, a reporter sequence of choice can be integrated into a targeted, chosen genomic locus, reflecting clinically relevant integration sites. In the protocol, the design of an HIV-derived reporter and choosing of a target site and gRNA sequence are described. A targeting vector with homology arms is constructed and transfected into Jurkat T cells. The reporter sequence is targeted to the selected genomic site by homologous recombination facilitated by a Cas9-mediated double-strand break at the target site. Single-cell clones are generated and screened for targeting events by flow cytometry and PCR.

Firstly, a whole-cell biocatalyst Escherichia coli strain was constructed by plasmid-based expression of xylene monooxygenase (XMO), benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH), and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BZDH) from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 33015, resulting in MPCA titer of 5.0 g/L. Then, the reaction conditions were optimized and the MPCA titer was further increased to 9.1 g/L. Next, the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator v2.0 was used to predict and compare the translation initiation rates of the RBS sequences preceding xylM and xylA genes, encoding the two subunits of XMO. By optimizing the RBS sequences preceding xylA, the MPCA titer was increased to 10.2 g/L and the yield of MPCA on DMP reached 0.665 mol/mol.

The ability to detect methylation patterns in these cells allows research into pluripotency markers. The recently developed CRISPR system has allowed widespread application of genome engineering techniques. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a potent system for genome editing, can be used for gene knockout or knock-in genome manipulations through substitution of a target genetic sequence with a desired donor sequence. Two types of genome engineering can be initiated: homologous or nonhomologous DNA repair by the Cas9 nuclease. Delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 and target donor vectors in human pluripotent stem cells can be accomplished via viral and nonviral delivery methods. Nonviral delivery includes lipid-mediated transfection and electroporation. It has become the most common and efficient in vitro delivery method for human pluripotent stem cells. The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be combined with inducible pluripotent stem cells to generate single or multiple gene knockouts, correct mutations, or insert reporter transgenes. Knockouts can also be utilized to investigate epigenetic roles and targets, such as investigation of DNA methylation. CRISPR could be combined with human pluripotent stem cells to explore genetic determinants of lineage choice, differentiation, and stem cell fate, allowing investigators to study how various genes or noncoding elements contribute to specific processes and pathways. The CRISPR-Cas9 system can also be used to create null or nucleasedead Cas9, which has no enzymatic activity but has been utilized through fusion with other functional protein domains.

Building on prior development of multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), our work addresses these problems in a single framework. Using a dominant-negative mutant protein of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, we achieved a transient suppression of DNA repair in Escherichia coli, which is necessary for efficient oligonucleotide integration. By integrating all necessary components into a broad-host vector, we developed a new workflow we term pORTMAGE. It allows efficient modification of multiple loci, without any observable off-target mutagenesis and prior modification of the host genome. Because of the conserved nature of the bacterial MMR system, pORTMAGE simultaneously allows genome editing and mutant library generation in other biotechnologically and clinically relevant bacterial species. Finally, we applied pORTMAGE to study a set of antibiotic resistance-conferring mutations in Salmonella enterica and E. coli. Despite over 100 million y of divergence between the two species, mutational effects remained generally conserved. In sum, a single transformation of a pORTMAGE plasmid allows bacterial species of interest to become an efficient host for genome engineering. These advances pave the way toward biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

However, recent technical developments in stem cell biology and genetic engineering have again brought the rat to the forefront of biomedical studies and enabled researchers to exploit the increasingly accessible wealth of genome sequence information.

We will also describe the remarkable progress that has been made in the development of gene editing enzymes that enable the generation of transgenic rats directly through targeted genetic modifications in the genomes of zygotes. The simplicity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the CRISPR/Cas gene editing system, in particular, mean that the ability to engineer the rat genome is no longer a limiting factor.

Here we investigated this hypothesis. A single-strand annealing assay using a reporter plasmid demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage efficiencies of the target double-stranded DNA were significantly reduced by IFNα. A mismatch recognition nuclease-dependent genotyping assay also demonstrated that IFNα reduced insertion or deletion (indel) mutation levels by approximately half. Treatment with IFNα did not alter Cas9 protein expression levels, whereas the copy numbers of guide RNA (gRNA) were significantly reduced by IFNα stimulation.

Recent rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis techniques are enabling the design and construction of new biological parts (genes), devices (gene networks) and modules (biosynthetic pathways), and the redesign of biological systems (cells and organisms) for useful purposes. In 2014, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae became the first eukaryotic cell to be equipped with a fully functional synthetic chromosome. This was achieved following the synthesis of the first viral (poliovirus in 2002 and bacteriophage Phi-X174 in 2003) and bacterial (Mycoplasma genitalium in 2008 and Mycoplasma mycoides in 2010) genomes, and less than two decades after revealing the full genome sequence of a laboratory (S288c in 1996) and wine (AWRI1631 in 2008) yeast strain. A large international project - the Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project - is now underway to synthesize all 16 chromosomes (∼12 Mb carrying ∼6000 genes) of the sequenced S288c laboratory strain by 2018. If successful, S. cerevisiae will become the first eukaryote to cross the horizon of in silico design of complex cells through de novo synthesis, reshuffling, and editing of genomes. In the meantime, yeasts are being used as cell factories for the semi-synthetic production of high-value compounds, such as the potent antimalarial artemisinin, and food ingredients, such as resveratrol, vanillin, stevia, nootkatone, and saffron. As a continuum of previously genetically engineered industrially important yeast strains, precision genome engineering is bound to also impact the study and development of wine yeast strains supercharged with synthetic DNA. The first taste of what the future holds is the de novo production of the raspberry ketone aroma compound, 4-[4-hydroxyphenyl]butan-2-one, in a wine yeast strain (AWRI1631), which was recently achieved via metabolic pathway engineering and synthetic enzyme fusion. A peek over the horizon is revealing that the future of ""Wine Yeast 2.0"" is already here. Therefore, this article seeks to help prepare the wine industry - an industry rich in history and tradition on the one hand, and innovation on the other - for the inevitable intersection of the ancient art practiced by winemakers and the inventive science of pioneering ""synthetic genomicists"". It would be prudent to proactively engage all stakeholders - researchers, industry practitioners, policymakers, regulators, commentators, and consumers - in a meaningful dialog about the potential challenges and opportunities emanating from Synthetic Biology. To capitalize on the new vistas of synthetic yeast genomics, this paper presents wine yeast research in a fresh context, raises important questions and proposes new directions."

Recent years have brought a boon in these technologies, now collectively known as genome engineering. Defined genomic manipulations at the nucleotide level enable a variety of reverse engineering paradigms, providing new opportunities to interrogate diverse biological functions. These genetic modifications include controlled removal, insertion, and substitution of genetic fragments, both small and large. Small fragments up to a few kilobases (e.g., single nucleotide mutations, small deletions, or gene tagging at single or multiple gene loci) to large fragments up to megabase resolution can be manipulated at single loci to create deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations of substantial sections of whole chromosome arms. A specialized substitution of chromosomal portions that presumably are functionally orthologous between different organisms through syntenic replacement, can provide proof of evolutionary conservation between regulatory sequences. Large transgenes containing endogenous or synthetic DNA can be integrated at defined genomic locations, permitting an alternative proof of evolutionary conservation, and sophisticated transgenes can be used to interrogate biological phenomena. Precision engineering can additionally be used to manipulate the genomes of organelles (e.g., mitochondria). Novel genome engineering paradigms are often accelerated in existing, easily genetically tractable model organisms, primarily because these paradigms can be integrated in a rigorous, existing technology foundation. The Drosophila melanogaster fly model is ideal for these types of studies. Due to its small genome size, having just four chromosomes, the vast amount of cutting-edge genetic technologies, and its short life-cycle and inexpensive maintenance requirements, the fly is exceptionally amenable to complex genetic analysis using advanced genome engineering. Thus, highly sophisticated methods developed in the fly model can be used in nearly any sequenced organism.

With the continued increase in population, rice will play a key role in achieving the food security. However, in the constantly shrinking scenario of rice fields, the necessity of these extra grains of rice must be met by reducing the yield loss due to various abiotic and biotic stresses. The adverse effects of climate impact both quality and quantity of rice production. One of the most desirable applications of CRISPR/Cas technology would be to develop climate smart rice crop to sustain and enhance its productivity in the changing environment. In this review, we analyze the desirable phenotypes and responsible genetic factors, which can be utilized to develop tolerance against major abiotic stresses imposed by climate change through genome engineering. The possibility of utilizing the information from wild resources to engineer the corresponding alleles of cultivated rice has been presented. We have also shed light on available resources for generating genome edited rice lines. The CRISPR/Cas mediated genome editing strategies for engineering of novel genes were proposed to create a plant phenotype, which can face the adversities of climate change. Further, challenges of off-targets and undesirable phenotype were discussed."

However the recombination machinery in P. pastoris is less effective in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where efficient homologous recombination naturally facilitates genetic modifications. The lack of simple and efficient methods for gene disruption and specifically integrating cassettes has remained a bottleneck for strain engineering in P. pastoris. Therefore tools and methods for targeted genome modifications are of great interest. Here we report the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies for P. pastoris and demonstrate targeting efficiencies approaching 100%. However there appeared to be a narrow window of optimal conditions required for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 function for this host. We systematically tested combinations of various codon optimized DNA sequences of CAS9, different gRNA sequences, RNA Polymerase III and RNA Polymerase II promoters in combination with ribozymes for the expression of the gRNAs and RNA Polymerase II promoters for the expression of CAS9. Only 6 out of 95 constructs were functional for efficient genome editing. We used this optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene disruption studies, to introduce multiplexed gene deletions and to test the targeted integration of homologous DNA cassettes. This system allows rapid, marker-less genome engineering in P. pastoris enabling unprecedented strain and metabolic engineering applications. "

CB03234, which is very promising for the development of anticancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). To improve the titer of TNM-A, we have generated high-producing mutants CB03234-S and CB03234-R through ribosome engineering, but still not sufficient for pilot production of TNM-A. As the follow-up work, gentamycin-induced ribosome engineering was further adopted here to generate the mutant CB03234-G, which produced similar level of TNM-A as in CB03234-S and CB03234-R. Benefiting from the distinct antibiotic resistances of three ribosome engineering mutants, genome shuffling between any two of them was respectively carried out, and finally obtained the recombinant CB03234-GS26. Under optimal conditions, CB03234-GS26 produced 40.6 ± 1.0 mg/L TNM-A in shaking flasks and 20.8 ± 0.4 mg/L in a scaled-up 30-L fermentor. Comparing with the parental high-producing mutants, the over 1.6-fold titer improvement of CB03234-GS26 in fermentor was more promising for pilot production of TNM-A. Besides the distinctive morphological features, genetic characterization revealed that CB03234-GS26 possessed 1.8 kb rsmG related deletion just the same as CB03234-S, but no mutation was found in rpsL. Subsequent knockouts proved that rsmG was unrelated to titer improvement of TNM-A, which implied other genomic variations and mechanisms rather than ribosome engineering to enhance the biosynthesis of TNM-A. Therefore, CB03234-GS26 provided a basis to locate potential novel genetic targets, and explore the interactions between complex metabolic network and TNM biosynthetic pathway, which shall promote future construction of high-yielding systems for TNM-A and other anthraquinone-fused enediynes.Key Points •United genome shuffling and ribosome engineering help further strain improvement. •CB03234-GS26 with improved titer is practical for the pilot production of TNM-A. •Enhanced TNM-A production should attribute to novel genetic features/mechanisms."

By analyzing genome-wide instability in HUS1 ablated cells, HUS1 is shown to have a conserved role, by which it preserves genome stability and also a divergent role, by which it promotes genome variability. These roles of HUS1 are related to distinct patterns of formation and resolution of single-stranded DNA and γH2A, throughout the cell cycle. Our findings suggest that Leishmania 9-1-1 subunits have evolved to co-opt canonical genomic maintenance and genomic variation functions. Hence, this study reveals a pivotal function of HUS1 in balancing genome stability and transmission in Leishmania.

Here, we describe two novel tyrosine site-specific recombination systems designated Nigri/nox and Panto/pox. Nigri originates from Vibrio nigripulchritudo (plasmid VIBNI_pA) and recombines its target site nox with high efficiency and high target-site selectivity, without recombining target sites of the well established SSRs Cre, Dre, Vika and VCre. Panto, derived from Pantoea sp. aB, is less specific and in addition to its native target site, pox also recombines the target site for Dre recombinase, called rox. This relaxed specificity allowed the identification of residues that are involved in target site selectivity, thereby advancing our understanding of how SSRs recognize their respective DNA targets."

Effective genome engineering methods are crucial to metabolic engineering and synthetic biology studies of C. glutamicum. Herein, a homing endonuclease I-SceI-mediated genome engineering strategy was established for the model strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. A vegetative R6K replicon-based, suicide plasmid was employed. The plasmid, pLS3661, contains both tightly regulated, IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible I-SceI expression elements and two I-SceI recognition sites. Following cloning of the homologous arms into pLS3661 and transfer the recombinant vector into C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, through the homologous recombination between the cloned fragment and its chromosomal allele, a merodiploid was selected under kanamycin selection. Subsequently, a merodiploid was resolved by double-stranded break repair stimulated by IPTG-stimulated I-SceI expression, generating desired mutants. The protocol obviates a pre-generated strain, transfer of a second I-SceI expression plasmid, and there is not any strain, medium, and temperature restrictions. We validated the approach via deletions of five genes (up to ~ 13.0 kb) and knock-in of one DNA fragment.

The first truly targetable reagents were the zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) showing that arbitrary DNA sequences could be addressed for cleavage by protein engineering, ushering in the breakthrough in genome manipulation. ZFNs resulted from basic research on zinc finger proteins and the FokI restriction enzyme (which revealed a bipartite structure with a separable DNA-binding domain and a non-specific cleavage domain). Studies on the mechanism of cleavage by 3-finger ZFNs established that the preferred substrates were paired binding sites, which doubled the size of the target sequence recognition from 9 to 18bp, long enough to specify a unique genomic locus in plant and mammalian cells. Soon afterwards, a ZFN-induced DSB was shown to stimulate homologous recombination in cells. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that are based on bacterial TALEs fused to the FokI cleavage domain expanded this capability. The fact that ZFNs and TALENs have been used for genome modification of more than 40 different organisms and cell types attests to the success of protein engineering. The most recent technology platform for delivering a targeted DSB to cellular genomes is that of the RNA-guided nucleases, which are based on the naturally occurring Type II prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs that use protein motifs for DNA sequence recognition, CRISPR-Cas9 depends on RNA-DNA recognition. The advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system-the ease of RNA design for new targets and the dependence on a single, constant Cas9 protein-have led to its wide adoption by research laboratories around the world. These technology platforms have equipped scientists with an unprecedented ability to modify cells and organisms almost at will, with wide-ranging implications across biology and medicine. However, these nucleases have also been shown to cut at off-target sites with mutagenic consequences.

A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called 'off-targets' by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content of the target correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that 'high-fidelity' variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants. We present these molecular tools as standardised DNA parts to facilitate their re-use."

The multi-integration modules can be readily ligated into plasmids containing large BGCs by Gibson assembly, which can be simultaneously inserted into multiple native attB sites in a single step.

The suicide plasmid pEX18Tc, carrying a functional allele of the upp gene of P. mendocina NK-01, was used to construct the vectors to delete the algA (encoding mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase) and phaZ (encoding PHA(MCL) depolymerase) genes, and a 30 kb chromosomal fragment in the 5-FU resistant background host. The genes were removed efficiently from the genome of P. mendocina NK-01 and left a markerless chromosomal mutant. In addition, two exogenous genes were inserted into the phaC1 (PHA(MCL) polymerase) loci of Pseudomonas putida KT-∆UPP simultaneously. Thus, we constructed a genetically stable and marker-free P. putida KT2440 mutant with integrated mpd (encoding methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH)) and pytH (encoding a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (PytH)) gene on the chromosome. The upp-based counterselection system could be further adapted for P. mendocina NK-01 and P. putida KT2440 and used for genome reduction and metabolic pathway engineering."

We compared several Cas9 variants from different microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) and Streptococcus thermophilius CRISPR1 (St1Cas9) as well as Cas12a derived from Francisella novicida (FnCas12a). At the commonly used E. coli model genes  LacZ, we found that SaCas9 and St1Cas9 induced DNA cleavage more effectively than FnCas12a. Both St1Cas9 and SaCas9 were orthogonal to SpCas9 and the induced DNA cleavage promoted the integration of heterologous DNA of up to 10 kb, at which size St1Cas9 was superior to SaCas9 in recombination frequency/accuracy. We harnessed the St1Cas9 system to integrate SpdCas9 and sgRNA arrays for constitutive knockdown of three genes, knock-in pyc and knockout adhE, without compromising the CRISPRi knockdown efficiency.

Gains in productivity of industrial microbes depend on the development of improved strains. Classical strain improvement programmes for the generation, screening and isolation of such mutant strains have existed for several decades. An alternative to traditional strain improvement methods, genome shuffling, allows the directed evolution of whole organisms via recursive recombination at the genome level. This review deals chiefly with the technical aspects of genome shuffling. It first presents the diversity of organisms and phenotypes typically evolved using this technology and then reviews available sources of genetic diversity and recombination methodologies. Analysis of the literature reveals that genome shuffling has so far been restricted to microorganisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with an overepresentation of antibiotics- and biofuel-producing microbes. Mutagenesis is the main source of genetic diversity, with few studies adopting alternative strategies. Recombination is usually done by protoplast fusion or sexual recombination, again with few exceptions. For both diversity and recombination, prospective methods that have not yet been used are also presented. Finally, the potential of genome shuffling for gaining insight into the genetic basis of complex phenotypes is also discussed. "

However, very few phage genomes have been well-characterized, the tailed phage T4 genome being one of them. Even in T4, much of the genome remained uncharacterized. The classical genetic strategies are tedious, compounded by genome modifications such as cytosine hydroxylmethylation and glucosylation which makes T4 DNA resistant to most restriction endonucleases. Here, using the type-II CRISPR-Cas9 system, we report the editing of both modified (ghm-Cytosine) and unmodified (Cytosine) T4 genomes. The modified genome, however, is less susceptible to Cas9 nuclease attack when compared to the unmodified genome. The efficiency of restriction of modified phage infection varied greatly in a spacer-dependent manner, which explains some of the previous contradictory results. We developed a genome editing strategy by codelivering into E. coli a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid and a donor plasmid containing the desired mutation(s). Single and multiple point mutations, insertions and deletions were introduced into both modified and unmodified genomes. As short as 50-bp homologous flanking arms were sufficient to generate recombinants that can be selected under the pressure of CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease. A 294-bp deletion in RNA ligase gene rnlB produced viable plaques, demonstrating the usefulness of this editing strategy to determine the essentiality of a given gene.

Here, we increase the efficiency of isolating precise HDR-mediated events in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by more than 20-fold through the use of co-incidental insertion (COIN) of independent donor DNA sequences. Analysis of on:off-target frequencies at the Lef1 gene revealed that bi-allelic insertion of a PGK-Neo cassette occurred more frequently than expected. Using various selection cassettes targeting multiple loci, we show that the insertion of a selectable marker at one control site frequently coincided with an insertion at an unlinked, independently targeted site, suggesting enrichment of a sub-population of HDR-proficient cells. When individual cell events were tracked using flow cytometry and fluorescent protein markers, individual cells frequently performed either a homology-dependent insertion event or a homology-independent event, but rarely both types of insertions in a single cell. Thus, when HDR-dependent selection donors are used, COIN enriches for HDR-proficient cells among heterogeneous cell populations. When combined with a self-excising selection cassette, COIN provides highly efficient and scarless genome editing."

Pertaining to brain tumors, neural progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered with different combinations of genetic driver mutations observed in distinct molecular subtypes of glioblastomas, the most common form of primary brain cancer in adults, give rise to brain tumors when engrafted orthotopically in mice. These glioblastoma models recapitulate the transcriptomic signature of each molecular subtype and authentically resemble pathobiology of glioblastoma, including inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, chromosomal aberrations, and extrachromosomal DNA amplifications. Similar engineering with genetic mutations found in medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors in iPSCs have led to genetically trackable models that bear clinical relevance to these pediatric brain tumors. These models have contributed to improved comprehension of the genetic causation of tumorigenesis and offered a novel platform for therapeutic discovery. Studied in the context of three-dimensional cerebral organoids, these models have aided in the study of tumor invasion as well as therapeutic responses.

The APC not only serves as a carrier for intracellular plasmid delivery but also can harvest external NIR-II photonic energy and convert it into local heat to induce the gene expression of the Cas9 endonuclease.

This syntax provides a layer of abstraction that moves users away from reading and writing raw DNA sequences toward composing designs in terms of functional parts . GSL increases the speed at which scientists can design DNA constructs, provides a precise and reproducible representation of parts, and achieves these goals while maintaining design flexibility. Finally, the GSL compiler can emit information such as the exact final DNA sequence of the design as well as the reagents (primers and template information) required to physically build the constructs.

Mu transposition is catalyzed by MuA transposase, with DNA cleavage and integration reactions ultimately attaching the transposon DNA to target DNA. To improve the activity of the Mu DNA transposition machinery, we mutagenized MuA protein and screened for hyperactivity-causing substitutions using an in vivo assay. The individual activity-enhancing substitutions were mapped onto the MuA-DNA complex structure, containing a tetramer of MuA transposase, two Mu end segments and a target DNA. This analysis, combined with the varying effect of the mutations in different assays, implied that the mutations exert their effects in several ways, including optimizing protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts. Based on these insights, we engineered highly hyperactive versions of MuA, by combining several synergistically acting substitutions located in different subdomains of the protein. Purified hyperactive MuA variants are now ready for use as second-generation tools in a variety of Mu-based DNA transposition applications. These variants will also widen the scope of Mu-based gene transfer technologies toward medical applications such as human gene therapy. Moreover, the work provides a platform for further design of custom transposases."

Genome engineering has been widely applied to sheep and goat research. Pronuclear injection and somatic cell nuclear transfer represent the two primary procedures for the generation of genetically modified sheep and goats. Further assisted tools have emerged to enhance the efficiency of genetic modification and to simplify the generation of genetically modified founders. These tools include sperm-mediated gene transfer, viral vectors, RNA interference, recombinases, transposons, and endonucleases. Of these tools, the four classes of site-specific endonucleases (meganucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPRs) have attracted wide attention due to their DNA double-strand break-inducing role, which enable desired DNA modifications based on the stimulation of native cellular DNA repair mechanisms. Currently, CRISPR systems dominate the field of genome editing. Gene-edited sheep and goats, generated using these tools, provide valuable models for investigations on gene functions, improving animal breeding, producing pharmaceuticals in milk, improving animal disease resistance, recapitulating human diseases, and providing hosts for the growth of human organs. In addition, more promising derivative tools of CRISPR systems have emerged such as base editors which enable the induction of single-base alterations without any requirements for homology-directed repair or DNA donor. These precise editors are helpful for revealing desirable phenotypes and correcting genetic diseases controlled by single bases.

We and others have recently shown that the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be employed to engineer the Drosophila genome, and that these modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline. A single targeting RNA can guide Cas9 to a specific genomic sequence where it induces double-strand breaks that, when imperfectly repaired, yield mutations. We have also demonstrated that 2 targeting RNAs can be used to generate large defined deletions and that Cas9 can catalyze gene replacement by homologous recombination. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have shown similar promise in Drosophila. However, the ease of producing targeting RNAs over the generation of unique sequence-directed nucleases to guide site-specific modifications makes the CRISPR/Cas9 system an appealingly accessible method for genome editing. From the initial planning stages, engineered flies can be obtained within a month. Here we highlight the variety of genome modifications facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system along with key considerations for starting your own CRISPR genome engineering project. "

They typically omit degradation pathways, complete cofactor balances, and atom transition contributions for reactions outside central metabolism. This study addresses the impact on prediction fidelity of scaling-up mapping models to a genome-scale. The core mapping model employed in this study accounts for (75 reactions and 65 metabolites) primarily from central metabolism. The genome-scale metabolic mapping model (GSMM) (697 reaction and 595 metabolites) is constructed using as a basis the iAF1260 model upon eliminating reactions guaranteed not to carry flux based on growth and fermentation data for a minimal glucose growth medium. Labeling data for 17 amino acid fragments obtained from cells fed with glucose labeled at the second carbon was used to obtain fluxes and ranges. Metabolic fluxes and confidence intervals are estimated, for both core and genome-scale mapping models, by minimizing the sum of square of differences between predicted and experimentally measured labeling patterns using the EMU decomposition algorithm. Overall, we find that both topology and estimated values of the metabolic fluxes remain largely consistent between core and GSM model. Stepping up to a genome-scale mapping model leads to wider flux inference ranges for 20 key reactions present in the core model. The glycolysis flux range doubles due to the possibility of active gluconeogenesis, the TCA flux range expanded by 80% due to the availability of a bypass through arginine consistent with labeling data, and the transhydrogenase reaction flux was essentially unresolved due to the presence of as many as five routes for the inter-conversion of NADPH to NADH afforded by the genome-scale model. By globally accounting for ATP demands in the GSMM model the unused ATP decreased drastically with the lower bound matching the maintenance ATP requirement. A non-zero flux for the arginine degradation pathway was identified to meet biomass precursor demands as detailed in the iAF1260 model. Inferred ranges for 81% of the reactions in the genome-scale metabolic (GSM) model varied less than one-tenth of the basis glucose uptake rate (95% confidence test). This is because as many as 411 reactions in the GSM are growth coupled meaning that the single measurement of biomass formation rate locks the reaction flux values. This implies that accurate biomass formation rate and composition are critical for resolving metabolic fluxes away from central metabolism and suggests the importance of biomass composition (re)assessment under different genetic and environmental backgrounds. In addition, the loss of information associated with mapping fluxes from MFA on a core model to a GSM model is quantified."

Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome.

This strategy involves PCR amplification of a DNA cassette containing ISHp608-LE (left end)-antibiotic resistance gene-counterselection marker-ISHp608-RE (right end) by using primers containing extensions homologous to the adjacent regions of the target gene on the chromosome.

It is known that the methylation state of these regions confers transcriptional control over their associated genes. Given its governance on the transcriptome, cellular functions and identity, genome-wide DNA methylation pattern is tightly regulated and evidently predefined. However, how is the methylation pattern determined in vivo remains enigmatic. Based on in silico and in vitro evidence, recent studies proposed that the regional hypomethylated state is primarily determined by local DNA sequence, e.g., high CpG density and presence of specific transcription factor binding sites. Nonetheless, the dependency of DNA methylation on nucleotide sequence has not been carefully validated in vertebrates in vivo. Herein, with the use of medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model, the sequence dependency of DNA methylation was intensively tested in vivo. Our statistical modeling confirmed the strong statistical association between nucleotide sequence pattern and methylation state in the medaka genome. However, by manipulating the methylation state of a number of genomic sequences and reintegrating them into medaka embryos, we demonstrated that artificially conferred DNA methylation states were predominantly and robustly maintained in vivo, regardless of their sequences and endogenous states. This feature was also observed in the medaka transgene that had passed across generations. Thus, despite the observed statistical association, nucleotide sequence was unable to autonomously determine its own methylation state in medaka in vivo. Our results apparently argue against the notion of the governance on the DNA methylation by nucleotide sequence, but instead suggest the involvement of other epigenetic factors in defining and maintaining the DNA methylation landscape. Further investigation in other vertebrate models in vivo will be needed for the generalization of our observations made in medaka."

First, the success of cloning cattle by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or chromatin transfer (CT) is a significant advancement that has made obsolete the need for using embryonic stem (ES) cells to conduct cell-mediated genome engineering, whereby site-specific genetic modifications can be conducted in bovine somatic cells via DNA homologous recombination (HR) and whereby genetically engineered cattle can subsequently be produced by animal cloning from the genetically modified cells. With this approach, a chosen bovine genomic locus can be precisely modified in somatic cells, such as to knock out (KO) or knock in (KI) a gene via HR, a gene-targeting strategy that had almost exclusively been used in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, by the creative application of embryonic cloning to rejuvenate somatic cells, cattle genome can be sequentially modified in the same line of somatic cells and complex genetic modifications have been achieved in cattle. Very recently, the development of designer nucleases-such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-has enabled highly efficient and more facile genome engineering in cattle. Most notably, by employing such designer nucleases, genomes can be engineered at single-nucleotide precision; this process is now often referred to as genome or gene editing. The above achievements are a drastic departure from the traditional methods of creating genetically modified cattle, where foreign DNAs are randomly integrated into the animal genome, most often along with the integrations of bacterial or viral DNAs.

In silico CRISPR array analysis and plasmid interference assay revealed that TCA or TCG at the 5'-end of the protospacer was the functional protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for CRISPR targeting. With a lactose inducible promoter for CRISPR array expression, we significantly decreased the toxicity of CRISPR-Cas and enhanced the transformation efficiency, and successfully deleted spo0A with an editing efficiency of 100%. We further evaluated effects of the spacer length on genome editing efficiency. Interestingly, spacers ≤ 20 nt led to unsuccessful transformation consistently, likely due to severe off-target effects; while a spacer of 30-38 nt is most appropriate to ensure successful transformation and high genome editing efficiency. Moreover, multiplex genome editing for the deletion of spo0A and pyrF was achieved in a single transformation, with an editing efficiency of up to 100%. Finally, with the integration of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE1 or adhE2) to replace cat1 (the key gene responsible for butyrate production and previously could not be deleted), two mutants were created for n-butanol production, with the butanol titer reached historically record high of 26.2 g/L in a batch fermentation. Altogether, our results demonstrated the easy programmability and high efficiency of endogenous CRISPR-Cas. The developed protocol herein has a broader applicability to other prokaryotes containing endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems. C. tyrobutyricum could be employed as an excellent platform to be engineered for biofuel and biochemical production using the CRISPR-Cas based genome engineering toolkit."

The ability to make specific modifications to a plant's genetic material creates opportunities for rapid development of elite cultivars with desired traits. The plant genome can be altered in several ways, including targeted introduction of nucleotide changes, deleting DNA segments, introducing exogenous DNA fragments and epigenetic modifications. Targeted changes are mediated by sequence specific nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated protein) systems. Recent advances in engineering chimeric Cas nucleases fused to base editing enzymes permit for even greater precision in base editing and control over gene expression. In addition to gene editing technologies, improvement in delivery systems of exogenous DNA into plant cells have increased the rate of successful gene editing events. Regeneration of fertile plants containing the desired edits remains challenging; however, manipulation of embryogenesis-related genes such as BABY BOOM (BBM) has been shown to facilitate regeneration through tissue culture, often a major hurdle in recalcitrant cultivars. Epigenome reprogramming for improved crop performance is another possibility for future breeders, with recent studies on MutS HOMOLOG 1 (MSH1) demonstrating epigenetic-dependent hybrid vigor in several crops. While these technologies offer plant breeders new tools in creating high yielding, better adapted crop varieties, constantly evolving government policy regarding the cultivation of plants containing transgenes may impede the widespread adoption of some of these techniques.

Breeding tolerant cultivars against these abiotic stresses is the most sustainable and eco-friendly approach to cope with this challenge. Advances in genome editing technologies provide new opportunities for crop improvement by employing precision genome engineering for targeted crop traits. However, the selection of the candidate genes is critical for the success of achieving the desired traits. Broadly speaking, these genes could fall into two major categories, structural and regulatory genes. Structural genes encode proteins that provide stress tolerance directly, whereas regulatory genes act indirectly by controlling the expression of other genes involved in different cellular processes. Additionally, cis-regulatory sequences are also vital for achieving stress tolerance. We propose targeting of these regulatory and/or structural genes along with the cis-regulatory sequences via the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system as a robust, efficient, and practical approach for developing crop varieties resilient to climate change.

Here, we present an initial survey of the D. zingiberensis genome performed by next-generation sequencing technology together with a genome size investigation inferred by flow cytometry. The whole genome survey of D. zingiberensis generated 31.48 Gb of sequence data with approximately 78.70× coverage. The estimated genome size is 800 Mb, with a high level of heterozygosity based on K-mer analysis. These reads were assembled into 334 288 contigs with a N50 length of 1079 bp, which were further assembled into 92 163 scaffolds with a total length of 173.46 Mb. A total of 4935 genes, 81 tRNAs, 69 rRNAs, and 661 miRNAs were predicted by the genome analysis, and 263 484 repeated sequences were obtained with 419 372 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Among these SSRs, the mononucleotide repeat type was the most abundant (up to 54.60% of the total SSRs), followed by the dinucleotide (29.60%), trinucleotide (11.37%), tetranucleotide (3.53%), pentanucleotide (0.65%), and hexanucleotide (0.25%) repeat types. The 1C-value of D. zingiberensis was calibrated against Salvia miltiorrhiza and calculated as 0.87 pg (851 Mb) by flow cytometry, which was very close to the result of the genome survey. This is the first report of genome-wide characterization within this taxon."

Transformation of S. meliloti is counteracted by the restriction endonuclease HsdR degrading DNA which lacks the appropriate methylation pattern. We provide a stable S. meliloti hsdR deletion mutant showing enhanced transformation with Escherichia coli-derived plasmid DNA and demonstrate that using an E. coli plasmid donor, expressing S. meliloti methyl transferase genes, is an alternative strategy of increasing the transformation efficiency of S. meliloti. Furthermore, we devise a novel cloning-free genome editing (CFGE) method for S. meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Xanthomonas campestris, and demonstrate the applicability of this method for intricate applications of the Cre/lox recombination system in S. meliloti. An enhanced Cre/lox system, allowing for serial deletions of large genomic regions, was established. An assay of lox spacer mutants identified a set of lox sites mediating specific recombination. The availability of several non-promiscuous Cre recognition sites enables simultaneous specific Cre/lox recombination events. CFGE combined with Cre/lox recombination is put forward as powerful approach for targeted genome editing, involving serial steps of manipulation to expedite the genetic accessibility of S. meliloti as chassis.

SpCas9-NG exhibited a robust editing activity at sites with various NG PAMs without showing any preference for the third nucleotide after NG. Moreover, we showed that xCas9 and SpCas9-NG have higher specificity than SpCas9 at the CGG PAM site. We further demonstrated that different forms of cytosine or adenine base editors containing SpCas9-NG worked efficiently in rice with broadened PAM compatibility.

Their metabolism can be optimized and further expanded using tools like the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) systems. These tools have revolutionized the field of biotechnology, as they greatly streamline the genetic engineering of organisms from all domains of life. CRISPR-Cas and other nucleases mediate double-strand DNA breaks, which must be repaired to prevent cell death. In prokaryotes, these breaks can be repaired through either homologous recombination, when a DNA repair template is available, or through template-independent end joining, of which two major pathways are known. These end joining pathways depend on different sets of proteins and mediate DNA repair with different outcomes. Understanding these DNA repair pathways can be advantageous to steer the results of genome engineering experiments. In this review, we discuss different strategies for the genetic engineering of prokaryotes through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative end joining (AEJ), both of which are independent of exogenous DNA repair templates."

Here, we developed a genome engineering method in Bacillus subtilis using a synthetic gene circuit as a counter-selectable marker system. The system contained two repressible promoters (B. subtilis xylA (Pxyl) and spac (Pspac)) and two repressor genes (lacI and xylR). Pxyl-lacI was integrated into the B. subtilis genome with a target gene containing a desired mutation. The xylR and Pspac-chloramphenicol resistant genes (cat) were located on a helper plasmid. In the presence of xylose, repression of XylR by xylose induced LacI expression, the LacIs repressed the Pspac promoter and the cells become chloramphenicol sensitive. Thus, to survive in the presence of chloramphenicol, the cell must delete Pxyl-lacI by recombination between the wild-type and mutated target genes. The recombination leads to mutation of the target gene. The remaining helper plasmid was removed easily under the chloramphenicol absent condition. In this study, we showed base insertion, deletion and point mutation of the B. subtilis genome without leaving any foreign DNA behind. Additionally, we successfully deleted a 2-kb gene (amyE) and a 38-kb operon (ppsABCDE). This method will be useful to construct designer Bacillus strains for various industrial applications."

In recent years novel methods of genome modification known as genome editing, which utilize so called ""programmable"" nucleases, came into use. A true revolution in genome editing has been brought about by the introduction of the CRISP-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) system, in which one of such nucleases, i.e. Cas9, plays a major role. This system is based on the elements of the bacterial and archaeal mechanism responsible for acquired immunity against phage infections and transfer of foreign genetic material. Microorganisms incorporate fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR loci present in their genomes, which enables fast recognition and elimination of future infections. There are several types of CRISPR-Cas systems among prokaryotes but only elements of CRISPR type II are employed in genome engineering. CRISPR-Cas type II utilizes small RNA molecules (crRNA and tracrRNA) to precisely direct the effector nuclease - Cas9 - to a specific site in the genome, i.e. to the sequence complementary to crRNA. Cas9 may be used to: (i) introduce stable changes into genomes e.g. in the process of generation of knock-out and knock-in animals and cell lines, (ii) activate or silence the expression of a gene of interest, and (iii) visualize specific sites in genomes of living cells. The CRISPR-Cas-based tools have been successfully employed for generation of animal and cell models of a number of diseases, e.g. specific types of cancer. In the future, the genome editing by programmable nucleases may find wide application in medicine e.g. in the therapies of certain diseases of genetic origin and in the therapy of HIV-infected patients.

Its chloroplast (cp) genome is 155,871 bp in length with a typical quadripartite structure of the large (LSC, 86,302 bp) and small (SSC, 18,367 bp) single-copy regions, separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs, 25,601 bp). The genome contains 113 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNAs and four rRNAs. A total of 11 forward, 9 palindromic and 13 tandem repeats were detected in the D. stramonium cp genome. Most simple sequence repeats (SSR) are AT-rich and are less abundant in coding regions than in non-coding regions. Both SSRs and GC content were unevenly distributed in the entire cp genome. All preferred synonymous codons were found to use A/T ending codons. The difference in GC contents of entire genomes and of the three-codon positions suggests that the D. stramonium cp genome might possess different genomic organization, in part due to different mutational pressures. The five most divergent coding regions and four non-coding regions (trnH-psbA, rps4-trnS, ndhD-ccsA, and ndhI-ndhG) were identified using whole plastome alignment, which can be used to develop molecular markers for phylogenetics and barcoding studies within the Solanaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 68 protein-coding genes supported Datura as a sister to Solanum. This study provides valuable information for phylogenetic and cp genetic engineering studies of this poisonous and medicinal plant. "

The dramatic differences seen in the appearance and productivity of different breeds show the power of such selection on DNA sequence variations. Unfortunately, the global furore over the use of modern biotechnologies to introduce desired genetic variations into animal breeding programmes, and the regulatory uncertainty associated with these recombinant DNA techniques, has effectively precluded the use of these technologies in food animal breeding programmes. Ironically, many of these early transgenic animal applications targeted traits that favoured sustainability, such as disease resistance and decreased environmental impact. As a consequence, transgenic animals have had little opportunity to affect global agriculture, and only a handful of pharmaceutical applications have been successfully commercialised. New developments in genome editing hold considerable promise for targeting traits that improve both animal health and welfare, and frequently involve no introduction of DNA sequences from other species. Nonetheless, future global regulation and public acceptance of such methods remain uncertain. Proposals to regulate genome-edited animals based solely on the process used to influence DNA sequence variations (i.e. intentional genome editing) and any potential attendant risks, with no counterbalancing consideration of the ensuing benefits or risks associated with conventional selection programmes, will potentially forestall the use of genome editing in animal breeding programmes. No activity can survive a risk-only evaluation, and there are considerable opportunity costs associated with preventing breeders' access to safe technologies in order to achieve genetic improvements in livestock populations."

Using this assay, we were able to quantify the contribution of various sequence motifs towards the resulting DNA methylation state. Modeling of this comprehensive dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of their unmethylated state.

Although fungal natural products show an impressive variation in chemical structures and biological activities, their biosynthetic pathways share a number of key characteristics. First, genes encoding successive steps of a biosynthetic pathway tend to be located adjacently on the chromosome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Second, these BGCs are often are located on specific regions of the genome and show a discontinuous distribution among evolutionarily related species and isolates. Third, the same enzyme (super)families are often involved in the production of widely different compounds. Fourth, genes that function in the same pathway are often co-regulated, and therefore co-expressed across various growth conditions.

For plants, efforts were centred on obtaining heritable changes in most transformable crop species by inducing mutations into open reading frames of interest, via non-homologous end joining. Now it is important to take the next steps and further develop the technology to reach its full potential. For breeding, besides using DNA-free editing and avoiding off target effects, it will be desirable to apply the system for the mutation of regulatory elements and for more complex genome rearrangements. Targeting enzymatic activities, like transcriptional regulators or DNA modifying enzymes, will be important for plant biology in the future."

Injection of unfertilized, mouse metaphase II (mII) oocytes with Cas9 cRNA, gRNA and sperm enabled efficient editing of transgenic and native alleles. Pre-loading oocytes with Cas9 increased sensitivity to gRNA ~100-fold.

It is distinguished by its adaptability to the local environment, quality of feed changes, as well as its high resistance to diseases. The genome assembly of the Egyptian water buffalo has been achieved using a reference-based assembly workflow. Our workflow significantly reduced the computational complexity of the assembly process, and improved the assembly quality by integrating different public resources. We also compared our assembly to the currently available draft assemblies of water buffalo breeds. A total of 21,128 genes were identified in the produced assembly. A list of milk virgin-related genes; milk pregnancy-related genes; milk lactation-related genes; milk involution-related genes; and milk mastitis-related genes were identified in the assembly.

G-OnRamp also converts a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. The genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research. In the process, students learn about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Development of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback. Sixty-five researchers/educators from >40 institutions participated through in-person workshops, which produced >20 genome browsers now available for research and education.

Despite its close phylogenetic relationship with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, generating precise genomic alterations in this species is problematic. Previously we have shown that deletion of LIG4, which encodes an enzyme involved in Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), strongly enhances the probability of obtaining correctly modified transformants. In this work we used the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) system to genetically engineer the C. glabrata genome, targeting the genes ADE2, MET15 and SOK2, located on different chromosomes. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to replace the open reading frame (ORF) by the SAT1 selective marker or introduced a premature stop codon in ADE2 and MET15, as they are easily scored by their adenine or methionine auxotrophy, respectively. The SOK2 gene was modified by insertion of a triple HA-tag sequence and the transformants were verified in a western blot. The CRISPR-Cas9 mediated targeting efficiency varies depending on the gene targeted and the genetic modification performed. We show that CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing is more efficient than the conventional method in the wild-type strain, moreover it has the big advantage being marker-free. In previous work, we showed that the targeting efficiency is highly increased in the lig4Δ strain using the conventional way to delete genes in C. glabrata. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in this strain, the percentage of correct transformants is consistently higher compared to the wild-type strain. This indicates that using the lig4 mutant as such is already a strong improvement, while the CRISPR-Cas9 gives the additional advantage of not leaving a scar or marker and that it therefore can be used to generate multiple modifications."

It employs only two components, namely, Cas9 in the form of DNA, mRNA, or protein; and guide RNA (gRNA), which is specific to a target gene. When these components are transferred to cells, they create insertion/deletion mutations (indels) within a target gene. Therefore, when fetuses within the uteri of pregnant murine females are exposed to these reagents, fetal cells incorporating them should show mutations in the target gene. To examine a possible genome editing of fetal cells in vivo, we intravenously administered a solution containing plasmid DNA-FuGENE complex to pregnant wild-type female mice [which had been successfully mated with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing male transgenic mice] on day 12.5 of gestation. The plasmid DNA induces the expression of gRNA, which was targeted at the EGFP cDNA, and that of the Cas9 gene. All fetuses in the pregnant females should express EGFP systemically, since they are heterozygous (Tg/+) for the transgene. Thus, the delivery of CRISPR system targeted at EGFP in the fetuses will cause a reduced expression of EGFP as a result of the genome editing of EGFP genomic sequence. Of the 24 fetuses isolated from three pregnant females 2 days after gene delivery, 3 were found to have reduced fluorescence in their hearts. Genotyping of the dissected hearts revealed the presence of the transgene construct (Cas9 gene) in all the samples. Furthermore, all the three samples exhibited mutations at the target loci, although normal cells were also present. Thus, transplacental delivery of gene editing components may be a useful tool for developing animal models with heart disorder for heart-related disease research, and gene therapy in congenital heart defects such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). © 2019 IUBMB Life, 9999(9999):1-10, 2019."

For a long time, it was not possible to use DSB induction for efficient genome engineering due to the lack of a means to target DSBs to specific sites. This limitation was overcome by development of modified meganucleases and synthetic DNA-binding domains. Domains derived from zinc-finger transcription factors or transcription activator-like effectors may be designed to recognize almost any DNA sequence. By fusing these domains to the endonuclease domains of a class II restriction enzyme, an active endonuclease dimer may be formed that introduces a site-specific DSB. Recent studies demonstrate that gene knockouts via non-homologous end joining or gene modification via homologous recombination are becoming routine in many plant species. By creating a single genomic DSB, complete knockout of a gene, sequence-specific integration of foreign DNA or subtle modification of individual amino acids in a specific protein domain may be achieved. The induction of two or more DSBs allows complex genomic rearrangements such as deletions, inversions or the exchange of chromosome arms. The potential for controlled genome engineering in plants is tremendous. The recently discovered RNA-based CRISPR/Cas system, a new tool to induce multiple DSBs, and sophisticated technical applications, such as the in planta gene targeting system, are further steps in this development. At present, the focus remains on engineering of single genes; in the future, engineering of whole genomes will become an option. "

Expression and correct folding of the SRCR5 deletion CD163 on the surface of macrophages and biological activity of the protein as hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger was confirmed. Challenge of both PAMs and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 1, subtypes 1, 2, and 3 and PMMs with PRRSV genotype 2 showed complete resistance to viral infections assessed by replication. Confocal microscopy revealed the absence of replication structures in the SRCR5 CD163 deletion macrophages, indicating an inhibition of infection prior to gene expression, i.e. at entry/fusion or unpacking stages."

Recent remarkable advances in CRISPR/Cas technology have made it a feasible system for use in therapeutic applications and biotechnology. In the CRISPR/Cas system, a guide RNA (gRNA), interacting with the Cas protein, recognizes a genomic region with sequence complementarity, and the double-stranded DNA at the target site is cleaved by the Cas protein. A widely used gRNA is an RNA polymerase III (pol III)-driven single gRNA (sgRNA), which is produced by artificial fusion of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activation crRNA (tracrRNA). However, we identified a TTTT stretch, known as a termination signal of RNA pol III, in the scaffold region of the sgRNA. Here, we revealed that sgRNA carrying a TTTT stretch reduces the efficiency of sgRNA transcription due to premature transcriptional termination, and decreases the efficiency of genome editing. Unexpectedly, it was also shown that the premature terminated sgRNA may have an adverse effect of inducing RNA interference. Such disadvantageous effects were avoided by substituting one base in the TTTT stretch."

They are specifically designed to cleave double-stranded DNA at the desired target locus. This double-strand break subsequently engages the DNA repair pathway through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), resulting in either gene disruption or gene repair. Alternatively, the presence of homologous donor DNA allows for targeted integration of this exogenous donor DNA in this target locus through homology-directed DNA repair. The key bottleneck in genome engineering relates to the delivery and expression of the designer nucleases. One of the most attractive vector platforms for genome engineering is based on integration-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs). The intrinsic episomal nature of IDLVs is well suited to ensure transient expression of designer nucleases and minimize potential risks associated with their sustained expression. Unfortunately, their expression is compromised because of epigenetic silencing that interferes with the transcriptional competence of IDLVs. In this issue, Pelascini and colleagues now showed that this bottleneck could be overcome by interfering with chromatin remodeling using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. HDAC inhibition restored expression of designer nucleases from IDLVs and rescued their ability to achieve efficient targeted gene disruption by NHEJ comparable with that achieved with bona fide integrating lentiviral vectors. This study has implications for the ex vivo use of IDLVs for gene repair and gene targeting."

It is now possible for most bench scientists to alter DNA in living plant cells in a variety of ways, including introducing specific nucleotide substitutions in a gene that change a protein's amino acid sequence, deleting genes or chromosomal segments, and inserting foreign DNA at precise genomic locations. Such targeted DNA sequence modifications are enabled by sequence-specific nucleases that create double-strand breaks in the genomic loci to be altered. The repair of the breaks, through either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining, can be controlled to achieve the desired sequence modification.

Along with the development of these new genome editing tools has come advancements in technologies used to deliver them. In mammals genome engineering tools are typically delivered into in vitro fertilized single cell embryos which are subsequently cultured and then implanted into a recipient animal. In avian species this is not possible, so other methods have been developed for genome engineering in birds. The most common involves in vitro culturing of primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are cells that migrate through the embryonic circulatory system to the developing gonad and colonize the gonad, eventually differentiating into the gonadocytes which produce either sperm or ova. While in culture the PGCs can be modified to carry novel transgenes or gene edits, the population can be screened and enriched, and then transferred into a recipient embryo. The largest drawback of PGC culture is that culture methods do not transfer well across avian species, thus there are reliable culture methods for only a few species including the chicken. Two newer technologies that appear to be more easily adapted in a wider range of avian species are direct injection and sperm transfection assisted gene editing (STAGE). The direct injection method involves injecting genome engineering tools into the circulatory system of the developing embryo just prior to the developmental time point when the PGCs are migrating to the gonads. The genome engineering tools are complexed with transfection reagents, allowing for in vivo transfection of the PGCs. STAGE utilizes sperm transfection to deliver genome engineering tools directly to the newly fertilized embryo. Preliminary evidence indicates that both methodologies have the potential to be adapted for use in birds species other than the chicken, however further work is needed in this area."

High-throughput screening for frataxin activators has so far met with limited success because current cellular models may not accurately assess endogenous frataxin gene regulation. Here we report the design and validation of genome-engineering tools that enable the generation of human cell lines that express the frataxin gene fused to a luciferase reporter gene from its endogenous locus. Performing a pilot high-throughput genomic screen in a newly established reporter cell line, we uncovered novel negative regulators of frataxin expression. Rational design of small-molecule inhibitors of the identified frataxin repressors and/or high-throughput screening of large siRNA or compound libraries with our system may yield treatments for Friedreich's ataxia.

A knockout vector that contains regions of homology is first integrated into the chromosome of S. aureus by a single crossover event selected for at high temperatures (non-permissive for plasmid replication) and antibiotic selection. Next, the second crossover event is encouraged by growth without antibiotic selection at low temperature, leading at a certain frequency to the excision of the plasmid and the deletion of the gene of interest. To detect or encourage plasmid loss, either a beta-galactosidase screening method or, more typically, a counterselection step is used. We present here the adaptation of the counter-selectable marker pheS*, coding for a mutated subunit of the phenylalanine tRNA synthetase, for use in S. aureus. The PheS* protein variant allows for the incorporation of the toxic phenylalanine amino acid analogue para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) into proteins and the addition of 20-40 mM PCPA to rich media leads to drastic growth reduction for S. aureus and supplementing chemically defined medium with 2.5-5 mM PCPA leads to complete growth inhibition.

The circular genome is 15 287 bp in size, encoding 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region. The AT skew of this mt genome is slightly negative, and the nucleotide composition is biased toward A+T nucleotides (80.15%). All PCGs start with the typical ATN (ATA, ATC, ATG, and ATT) codons, except for the cox1 gene which may start with the CGA codon. Four of the 13 PCGs harbor the incomplete termination codon T or TA. All the tRNA genes are folded into the typical clover-leaf structure of mitochondrial tRNA, except for trnS1 (AGN) in which the DHU arm fails to form a stable stem-loop structure. The overlapping sequences are 35 bp in total and are found in seven different locations. A total of 240 bp of intergenic spacers are scattered in 16 regions. The control region of the mt genome is 327 bp in length and consisted of several features common to the sequenced lepidopteran insects. Phylogenetic analysis based on 13 PCGs using the Maximum Likelihood method shows that the placement of P. interpunctella was within the Pyralidae. "

Significant progress has been made in the therapeutics, diagnostics, and delivery of biomolecules in animal cells. However, nanotechnology is still in its infancy in plant science. Nanotechnology offers tremendous opportunities for crop improvement and would make significant contributions to increase agricultural productivity. There are several reports where nanomaterial-induced improvement of the agronomic traits has been successfully achieved. However, very little is known about the interactions of nanomaterials with plant cells and the mechanism of internalization and delivery of biomolecules using nanoparticles as a carrier. Due to the presence of the cell wall, the delivery of biomolecules such as nucleic acids is a major challenge, which limits the application of nanomaterials in genetic engineering-mediated crop improvement. However, in recent years, the use of various nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. for nucleic acid delivery in plant cells has been reported as proof of concept.

Within strain pairs, targeted placement of a conjugal origin of transfer and selectable markers in donor and recipient genomes enables the controlled transfer and selection of desired donor-recipient chimeric genomes. By design, selectable markers act as genomic anchor points, and they are recycled in subsequent rounds of hierarchical genome transfer.

The OLEs/TAGs ratio determines the size and shape of intracellular oil bodies. There is a lack of comprehensive sequence analysis and structural information of OLEs among diverse trees. The objectives of this study were to identify OLEs from 22 tree species (e.g., tung tree, tea-oil tree, castor bean), perform genome-wide analysis of OLEs, classify OLEs, identify conserved sequence motifs and amino acid residues, and predict secondary and three-dimensional structures in tree OLEs and OLE subfamilies. Data mining identified 65 OLEs with perfect conservation of the ""proline knot"" motif (PX5SPX3P) from 19 trees. These OLEs contained >40% hydrophobic amino acid residues. They displayed similar properties and amino acid composition. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that these proteins could be classified into five OLE subfamilies. There were distinct patterns of sequence conservation among the OLE subfamilies and within individual tree species. Computational modeling indicated that OLEs were composed of at least three α-helixes connected with short coils without any β-strand and that they exhibited distinct 3D structures and ligand binding sites. These analyses provide fundamental information in the similarity and specificity of diverse OLE isoforms within the same subfamily and among the different species, which should facilitate studying the structure-function relationship and identify critical amino acid residues in OLEs for metabolic engineering of tree TAGs.

Gene essentiality predictions made by the draft model were compared to data from individual pooled mutant experiments to identify areas of the model requiring deeper validation. Subsequent experiments showed that some of the discrepancies between the model and dataset were caused by polar effects, mis-mapped barcodes, or mutants carrying both wild-type and transposon disrupted gene copies-highlighting potential limitations inherent to data from individual mutants in these high-throughput datasets. Therefore, we analyzed correlations in fitness scores across all 492 experiments in the dataset in the context of functionally related metabolic reaction modules identified within the model via flux coupling analysis. These correlations were used to identify candidate genes for a reaction in histidine biosynthesis lacking an annotated gene and highlight metabolic modules with poorly correlated gene fitness scores. Additional genes for reactions involved in biotin, ubiquinone, and pyridoxine biosynthesis in Z. mobilis were identified and confirmed using mutant complementation experiments. These discovered genes, were incorporated into the final model, iZM4_478, which contains 747 metabolic and transport reactions (of which 612 have gene-protein-reaction associations), 478 genes, and 616 unique metabolites, making it one of the most complete models of Z. mobilis ZM4 to date.

The obscure puffer fish Takifugu obscurus is an anadromous species that migrates to freshwater from the sea for spawning. Thus the euryhaline characteristics of T. obscurus have been investigated to gain understanding of their survival ability, osmoregulation, and other homeostatic mechanisms in both freshwater and seawater. In this study, a high quality chromosome-level reference genome for T. obscurus was constructed using long-read Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel sequencing and a Hi-C-based chromatin contact map platform. The final genome assembly of T. obscurus is 381 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 3,296 kb and longest length of 10.7 Mb, from a total of 62 Gb of raw reads generated using single-molecule real-time sequencing technology from a PacBio Sequel platform. The PacBio data were further clustered into chromosome-scale scaffolds using a Hi-C approach, resulting in a 373 Mb genome assembly with a contig N50 length of 15.2 Mb and and longest length of 28 Mb. When we directly compared the 22 longest scaffolds of T. obscurus to the 22 chromosomes of the tiger puffer Takifugu rubripes, a clear one-to-one orthologous relationship was observed between the two species, supporting the chromosome-level assembly of T. obscurus. This genome assembly can serve as a valuable genetic resource for exploring fugu-specific compact genome characteristics, and will provide essential genomic information for understanding molecular adaptations to salinity fluctuations and the evolution of osmoregulatory mechanisms."
