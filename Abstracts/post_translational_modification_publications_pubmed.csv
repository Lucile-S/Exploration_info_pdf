31363817,,Post-translational modification and protein sorting to small extracellular vesicles including exosomes by ubiquitin and UBLs.,2019,Cell Mol Life Sci,10.1007/s00018-019-03246-7,"['Hiroshi Ageta', 'Kunihiro Tsuchida']","['Exosome', 'Multivesicular body', 'Post-translational modification', 'Small extracellular vesicle', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitin-like protein']","Exosomes, a type of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), are secreted membrane vesicles that are derived from various cell types, including cancer cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and immune cells via multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These sEVs contain RNAs (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and rRNA), lipids, DNA, proteins, and metabolites, all of which mediate cell-to-cell communication. This communication is known to be implicated in a diverse set of diseases such as cancers and their metastases and degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms, by which proteins are modified and sorted to sEVs, are not fully understood. Various cellular processes, including degradation, transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle, signal transduction, and autophagy, are known to be associated with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs). Recent studies have revealed that ubiquitin and UBLs also regulate MVBs and protein sorting to sEVs. Ubiquitin-like 3 (UBL3)/membrane-anchored Ub-fold protein (MUB) acts as a post-translational modification (PTM) factor to regulate efficient protein sorting to sEVs. In this review, we focus on the mechanism of PTM by ubiquitin and UBLs and the pathway of protein sorting into sEVs and discuss the potential biological significance of these processes."

Upregulation of MuRF1 gene transcription participates in skeletal muscle atrophy, on contrary downregulation of protein expression leads to cardiac hypertrophy. MuRF1 gene point mutations have been found to generate protein aggregate myopathies defined as muscle disorder characterized by protein accumulation in muscle fibers. We have discovered that MuRF1 turned out to be also a target for a new post-translational modification arbitrated by conjugation of SUMO1 and it is mediated by the SUMO ligases E2 UBC9 and the E3 PIASγ/4. SUMOylation takes place at lysine 238 localized at the second coiled-coil protein domain that is required for efficient substrate interaction for polyubiquitination. We provided evidence that SUMOylation is essential for MuRF1 nuclear translocation and its mitochondria accumulation is enhanced in hyperglycemic conditions delivering a stabilization of the overall SUMOylated proteins in cultured myocytes. Thus, our findings add this SUMO1 post-translational modification as a new concept to understand muscle disorders related to the defect in MuRF1 activity."

Modulation of protein SUMOylation or deSUMOylation modification has been associated with regulation of carcinogenesis in breast cancer. In the dynamic processes of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation in a variety of cancers, SUMO proteases (SENPs), reverse SUMOylation by isopeptidase activity and SENPs are mostly elevated, and are related to poor patient prognosis. Although underlying mechanisms have been suggested for how SENPs participate in breast cancer tumorigenesis, such as through regulation of target protein transactivation, cancer cell survival, cell cycle, or other post-translational modification-related machinery recruitment, the effect of SENP isoform-specific inhibitors on the progression of breast cancer have not been well evaluated. This review will introduce the functions of SENP1 and SENP2 and the underlying signaling pathways in breast cancer for use in discovery of new biomarkers for diagnosis or therapeutic targets for treatment.

In particular, peptide hormones offer advantages as cell-to-cell signals in that they can be synthesized rapidly and have the greatest diversity in their structure and function. Peptides often undergo post-translational modifications and proteolytic processing to generate small oligopeptide hormones. In plants, such small post-translationally modified peptides constitute the largest group of peptide hormones. We initially explored this type of peptide hormone using bioassay-guided fractionation and later by in silico gene screening coupled with biochemical peptide detection, which led to the identification of four types of novel peptide hormones in plants. We also identified specific receptors for these peptides and transferases required for their post-translational modification. This review summarizes how we discovered these peptide hormone-receptor pairs and post-translational modification enzymes, and how these molecules function in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation."

Quantification of PTM site stoichiometry can help in prioritizing sites for functional analyses and is important for constructing mechanistic models of PTM-dependent protein regulation.

The characterization of frailty status is currently based on the collection of clinical data and on the use of various tools such as Fried's criteria, which constitutes a difficult and time-consuming process. Up to now, no biological markers have been described as reliable tools for frailty characterization. We tested the hypothesis that a link between frailty and protein molecular aging existed. This study aimed therefore at determining whether post-translational modification derived products (PTMDPs), recognized as biomarkers of protein aging, were associated with frailty status in elderly subjects. Methods Frailty status was determined according to Fried's criteria in 250 elderly patients (>65 years old) hospitalized in a short-term care unit. Serum concentrations of protein-bound PTMDPs, including carboxymethyllysine (CML), pentosidine, methylglyoxal-hydroimidazolone-1 and homocitrulline (HCit), were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and tissue content of advanced glycation end-products was assessed by skin autofluorescence (SAF) measurement. Associations between PTMDPs and frailty status were analyzed using logistic regression models. Results Frail patients had significantly (p<0.01) higher CML, HCit, and SAF values compared to non-frail and pre-frail subjects. By multivariate analysis, only HCit concentrations and SAF values remained associated with frailty status (p=0.016 and p=0.002, respectively), independently of age, comorbidities, renal function, C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations. Conclusions HCit and SAF are significantly associated with frailty status in elderly subjects. This study suggests that PTMDPs constitute promising biomarkers for identifying frail patients and guiding personalized patient care."

Although many post-translational modification sites have been experimentally determined, particularly in certain model organisms, experimental knowledge of these sites is severely lacking for many species. Thus, it is important to be able to predict sites of post-translational modification in such species. Previously, we described DAPPLE, a tool that facilitates the homology-based prediction of one particular post-translational modification, phosphorylation, in an organism of interest using known phosphorylation sites from other organisms. Here, we describe DAPPLE 2, which expands and improves upon DAPPLE in three major ways. First, it predicts sites for many post-translational modifications (20 different types) using data from several sources (15 online databases). Second, it has the ability to make predictions approximately 2-7 times faster than DAPPLE depending on the database size and the organism of interest. Third, it simplifies and accelerates the process of selecting predicted sites of interest by categorizing them based on gene ontology terms, keywords, and signaling pathways. We show that DAPPLE 2 can successfully predict known human post-translational modification sites using, as input, known sites from species that are either closely (e.g., mouse) or distantly (e.g., yeast) related to humans.

PTMs play essential roles in intracellular signaling and cell regulation, thus providing functional protein diversity in cell. Due this, impaired PTM patterns have been linked to multiple disease states. Clear link between PTMs and pathological conditions have also driven assay development further, but still today most of the methodologies are based on single-specificity or group-specific PTM-recognition. We have previously introduced leuzine-zipper based peptide-break technology as a viable option for universal PTM detection. Here, we introduce peptide-break technology utilizing single-label homogeneous quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET) and charge-based peptide-peptide interaction. We demonstrate the functionality of the new assay concept in phosphorylation, deacetylation, and citrullination. In a comparable study between previously introduced leucine-zipper and the novel charge-based approach, we found equal PTM detection performance and sensitivity, but the peptide design for new targets is simplified with the charged peptides. The new concept allows the use of short <20 amino acid peptides without limitations rising from the leucine-zipper coiled-coil structure. Introduced methodology enables wash-free PTM detection in a 384-well plate format, using low nanomolar enzyme concentrations. Potentially, the peptide-break technique using charged peptides may be applicable for natural peptide sequences directly obtained from the target protein."

However, this search strategy has not been widely used by the community, and one bottleneck of it is the lack of appropriate algorithms for automated and reliable post-processing of the coarse and error-prone search results. Here we present PTMiner, a software tool for confident filtering and localization of modifications (mass shifts) detected in an open search. After mass-shift-grouped false discovery rate (FDR) control of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), PTMiner uses an empirical Bayesian method to localize modifications through iterative learning of the prior probabilities of each type of modification occurring on different amino acids. The performance of PTMiner was evaluated on three data sets, including simulated data, chemically synthesized peptide library data and modified-peptide spiked-in proteome data. The results showed that PTMiner can effectively control the PSM FDR and accurately localize the modification sites. At 1% real false localization rate (FLR), PTMiner localized 93%, 84 and 83% of the modification sites in the three data sets, respectively, far higher than two open search engines we used and an extended version of the Ascore localization algorithm. We then used PTMiner to analyze a draft map of human proteome containing 25 million spectra from 30 tissues, and confidently identified over 1.7 million modified PSMs at 1% FDR and 1% FLR, which provided a system-wide view of both known and unknown PTMs in the human proteome."

Chaperone proteins maintain proper protein folding in the cell by utilizing a variety of distinct, characteristic mechanisms to prevent aberrant intermolecular interactions, prevent protein aggregation, and lower entropic costs to allow for protein refolding. Continued study has found that chaperones may exhibit alternative functions, including maintaining protein folding during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) import and chaperone-mediated degradation, among others. Alternative chaperone functions are frequently controlled by post-translational modification, in which a given chaperone can switch between functions through covalent modification. This review will focus on the Hsp70 class chaperones and their Hsp40 co-chaperones, specifically highlighting the importance of post-translational control of chaperones. These modifications may serve as a target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of diseases of protein misfolding and aggregation."

This assay was used as a method to predict if other Crohn's associated Nod2 variants were O-GlcNAcylated, and also identified the modification on another NLR, Nod1. Classical immunoprecipitations and NF-κB transcriptional assays were used to confirm the presence and effect of this modification on these proteins. The results presented here demonstrate that CETSA is a convenient method that can be used to detect the stability effect of O-GlcNAcylation on O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) client proteins and will be a powerful tool in studying post-translational modification."

M-NVs were generated through the extrusion of cells and proteomic profiling demonstrated an enrichment of proteins associated with membrane and cytosolic components. The proteomic data herein reveal a subset of proteins that are highly abundant in M-NVs in comparison to exosomes. M-NVs contain proteins that largely represent the parental cell proteome, whereas the profile of exosomal proteins highlight their endosomally derived origin. This advantage of M-NVs alleviates the necessity of endosomal sorting of endogenous therapeutic proteins or RNA into exosomes. This study also highlights differences in protein post-translational modifications among M-NVs, as distinct from exosomes. Overall this study provides key insights into defining the proteome composition of M-NVs as a distinct from exosomes, and the potential advantage of M-NVs as an alternative nanocarrier when spontaneous endosomal sorting of therapeutics are limited."

Hydrogen sulfide is produced in chloroplasts through the activity of sulfite reductase and in the cytosol and mitochondria by the action of sulfide-generating enzymes, and regulates/affects essential plant processes such as plant adaptation, development, photosynthesis, autophagy, and stomatal movement, where interplay with other signaling molecules occurs. The mechanism of action of sulfide, which modifies protein cysteine thiols to form persulfides, is related to its chemical features. This post-translational modification, called persulfidation, could play a protective role for thiols against oxidative damage. Hydrogen cyanide is produced during the biosynthesis of ethylene and camalexin in non-cyanogenic plants, and is detoxified by the action of sulfur-related enzymes. Cyanide functions include the breaking of seed dormancy, modifying the plant responses to biotic stress, and inhibition of root hair elongation. The mode of action of cyanide is under investigation, although it has recently been demonstrated to perform post-translational modification of protein cysteine thiols to form thiocyanate, a process called S-cyanylation. Therefore, the signaling roles of sulfide and most probably of cyanide are performed through the modification of specific cysteine residues, altering protein functions."

Therefore, in this study, we aim to incorporate post translational information with radial basis function networks to improve the predictive performance of transport proteins in major classes (channels/pores, electrochemical transporters, and active transporters) and six different families (α-type channels, β-barrel porins, pore-forming toxins, porters, PP bond hydrolysis-driven transporters, and oxidoreduction-driven transporters). The experiment results by using PSSM profiles combined with PTM information could classify the transporters into three classes and six families with five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 87.6% and 92.5%, respectively. For the independent dataset of 444 proteins, the performance with post translational modification attained the accuracy of 82.13% and 89.34% for classifying three classes and six families, respectively. Compared with the other methods and previous works, our result shows that the predictive performance is better with the accuracy improvement by 12%. We suggest that our study could become a robust model for biologists to discriminate transport proteins with high performance and understand better the function of transport proteins. Further, the contributions of this study could be fundamental for further research that can use PTM information to enhance numerous computational biology problems."

Peptides have now emerged as an important class of signals for cell-to-cell communication over short distances, and also for long-range signalling. We refer to these signalling molecules as peptide growth factors and peptide hormones, respectively. As compared to remarkable progress with respect to the mechanisms of peptide perception and signal transduction, the biogenesis of signalling peptides is still in its infancy. This review focuses on the biogenesis and activity of small post-translationally modified peptides. These peptides are derived from inactive pre-pro-peptides of approximately 70-120 amino acids. Multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) may be required for peptide maturation and activation, including proteolytic processing, tyrosine sulfation, proline hydroxylation and hydroxyproline glycosylation. While many of the enzymes responsible for these modifications have been identified, their impact on peptide activity and signalling is not fully understood. These PTMs may or may not be required for bioactivity, they may inactivate the peptide or modify its signalling specificity, they may affect peptide stability or targeting, or its binding affinity with the receptor. In the present review, we will first introduce the peptides that undergo PTMs and for which these PTMs were shown to be functionally relevant. We will then discuss the different types of PTMs and the impact they have on peptide activity and plant growth and development. We conclude with an outlook on the open questions that need to be addressed in future research."

In a mathematical model, perturbations often exert their effect through parameters, so sizes and shapes of parametric regions offer an integrated global estimate of robustness. Here, we explore this ""parameter geography"" for bistability in post-translational modification (PTM) systems. We use the previously developed ""linear framework"" for timescale separation to describe the steady-states of a two-site PTM system as the solutions of two polynomial equations in two variables, with eight non-dimensional parameters. Importantly, this approach allows us to accommodate enzyme mechanisms of arbitrary complexity beyond the conventional Michaelis-Menten scheme, which unrealistically forbids product rebinding. We further use the numerical algebraic geometry tools Bertini, Paramotopy, and alphaCertified to statistically assess the solutions to these equations at ∼109 parameter points in total. Subject to sampling limitations, we find no bistability when substrate amount is below a threshold relative to enzyme amounts. As substrate increases, the bistable region acquires 8-dimensional volume which increases in an apparently monotonic and sigmoidal manner towards saturation. The region remains connected but not convex, albeit with a high visibility ratio. Surprisingly, the saturating bistable region occupies a much smaller proportion of the sampling domain under mechanistic assumptions more realistic than the Michaelis-Menten scheme. We find that bistability is compromised by product rebinding and that unrealistic assumptions on enzyme mechanisms have obscured its parametric rarity. The apparent monotonic increase in volume of the bistable region remains perplexing because the region itself does not grow monotonically: parameter points can move back and forth between monostability and bistability. We suggest mathematical conjectures and questions arising from these findings. Advances in theory and software now permit insights into parameter geography to be uncovered by high-dimensional, data-centric analysis."

Here, we dissect the direct role of OTULIN in cell death and find that OTULIN limits apoptosis and necroptosis in keratinocytes. During apoptosis, OTULIN is cleaved by capase-3 at Asp-31 into a C-terminal fragment that restricts caspase activation and cell death. During necroptosis, OTULIN is hyper-phosphorylated at Tyr-56, which modulates RIPK1 ubiquitin dynamics and promotes cell death. OTULIN Tyr-56 phosphorylation is counteracted by the activity of dual-specificity phosphatase 14 (DUSP14), which we identify as an OTULIN phosphatase that limits necroptosis. Our data provide evidence of dynamic post-translational modifications of OTULIN and highlight their importance in cell death outcome."

To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NFκB transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins.

The Flp site-specific recombination system housed by the plasmid, which is central to plasmid copy number maintenance, is regulated at multiple levels. Transcription of the FLP gene is fine-tuned by the repressor function of the plasmid-coded partitioning proteins Rep1 and Rep2 and their antagonist Raf1, which is also plasmid-coded. In addition, the Flp protein is regulated by the host's post-translational modification machinery. Utilizing a Flp-SUMO fusion protein, which functionally mimics naturally sumoylated Flp, we demonstrate that the modification signals ubiquitination of Flp, followed by its proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, reduced binding affinity and cooperativity of the modified Flp decrease its association with the plasmid FRT (Flp recombination target) sites, and/or increase its dissociation from them. The resulting attenuation of strand cleavage and recombination events safeguards against runaway increase in plasmid copy number, which is deleterious to the host-and indirectly-to the plasmid. These results have broader relevance to potential mechanisms by which selfish genomes minimize fitness conflicts with host genomes by holding in check the extra genetic load they pose."

Type IV collagen is abundantly post-translationally modified with 3-hydroxyproline (3-Hyp), but 3-Hyp's biochemical role in type IV collagen's interactions with other proteins is not well established. In this work, we present binding data consistent with a major role of 3-Hyp in interactions of collagen IV with glycoprotein VI and nidogens 1 and 2. The increased binding interaction between type IV collagen without 3-Hyp and glycoprotein VI has been the subject of some controversy, which we sought to explore, whereas the lack of binding of nidogens to type IV collagen without 3-Hyp is novel. Using tandem MS, we show that the putative glycoprotein VI-binding site is 3-Hyp-modified in WT PFHR-9 type IV collagen, but not in PFHR-9 cells in which prolyl-3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) has been knocked out (KO). Moreover, we observed altered 3-Hyp occupancy across many other sites. Using amino acid analysis of type IV collagen from the WT and P3H2 KO cell lines, we confirm that P3H2 is the major, but not the only 3-Hyp-modifying enzyme of type IV collagen.

Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanism of hnRNPK regulation and its downstream effects on cancer and other diseases. A number of recent studies have highlighted that several post-translational modifications (PTMs) possibly play an important role in modulating hnRNPK function. Phosphorylation is the most widely occurring PTM in hnRNPK. For example, in vivo analyses of sites such as S116 and S284 illustrate the purpose of PTM of hnRNPK in altering its subcellular localization and its ability to bind target nucleic acids or proteins. Other PTMs such as methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage are increasingly implicated in the regulation of DNA repair, cellular stresses and tumour growth. In this review, we describe the PTMs that impact upon hnRNPK function on gene expression programmes and different disease states.

In this study, we examine all commonly occurring missense mutations in HTT to identify potential human modifiers of HTT PTMs relevant to HD biology. We reveal a SNP that modifies post-translational myristoylation of HTT, resulting in downstream alterations to toxic HTT proteolysis in human cells. This is the first SNP shown to functionally modify a PTM in HD and the first validated genetic modifier of post-translational myristoylation.

SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) attachment, or sumoylation, is a post-translational modification that is essential for the plant stress response, also modulating hormonal circuits to co-ordinate developmental processes. The Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1) is the major SUMO conjugation enhancer in response to stress, and is implicated in several aspects of plant development. Here we report that known SUMO targets are over-represented in multiple carbohydrate-related proteins, suggesting a functional link between sumoylation and sugar metabolism and signaling in plants. We subsequently observed that SUMO-conjugated proteins accumulate in response to high doses of sugar in a SIZ1-dependent manner, and that the null siz1 mutant displays increased expression of sucrose and starch catabolic genes and shows reduced starch levels. We demonstrated that SIZ1 controls germination time and post-germination growth via osmotic and sugar-dependent signaling, respectively. Glucose was specifically linked to SUMO-sugar interplay, with high levels inducing root growth inhibition and aberrant root hair morphology in siz1. The use of sugar analogs and sugar marker gene expression analysis allowed us to implicate SIZ1 in a signaling pathway dependent on glucose metabolism, probably involving modulation of SNF1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1) activity.

For example, IDRs provide efficient housing for large numbers of post-translational modification (PTM) sites in eukaryotic proteins. Here, we study the distribution of more than 15,000 experimentally determined human methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites (collectively termed 'MAU' sites) in ordered and disordered regions, and analyse their conservation across 380 eukaryotic species. Conservation signals for the maintenance and novel emergence of MAU sites are examined at 11 evolutionary levels from the whole eukaryotic domain down to the ape superfamily, in both ordered and disordered regions. We discover that MAU PTM is a major driver of conservation for arginines and lysines in both ordered and disordered regions, across the 11 levels, most significantly across the mammalian clade. Conservation of human methylatable arginines is very strongly favoured for ordered regions rather than for disordered, whereas methylatable lysines are conserved in either set of regions, and conservation of acetylatable and ubiquitinatable lysines is favoured in disordered over ordered. Notably, we find evidence for the emergence of new lysine MAU sites in disordered regions of proteins in deuterostomes and mammals, and in ordered regions after the dawn of eutherians. For histones specifically, MAU sites demonstrate an idiosyncratic significant conservation pattern that is evident since the last common ancestor of mammals. Similarly, folding-on-binding (FB) regions are highly enriched for MAU sites relative to either ordered or disordered regions, with ubiquitination sites in FBs being highly conserved at all evolutionary levels back as far as mammals. This investigation clearly demonstrates the complex patterns of PTM evolution across the human proteome and that it is necessary to consider conservation of sequence features at multiple evolutionary levels in order not to get an incomplete or misleading picture."

Confocal microscopy showed HAS2 wild type (wt) and its K190R and S221A mutants in ER, Golgi and extracellular vesicles, while the T110A mutant remained mostly in the ER. HA synthesis was reduced by S221A, while completely blocked by K190R and T110A. Cell-surface biotinylation indicated that T110A was absent from PM, while S221A was close to the level of wt, and K190R was increased in PM. TIRF microscopy analysis gave similar results. Rab10 silencing increased HA secretion by HAS2, likely by inhibiting endocytosis of the enzyme from PM, as reported before for HAS3. Green-to-red photo-conversion of Dendra2-HAS2 constructs suggested slower decay of K190R and S221A than HAS2 wt, while T110A was barely degraded at all.

AZI1 is required for systemic acquired resistance and it has recently been identified as a target of the stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK3. AZI1 gel migration properties strongly indicate AZI1 to undergo major post-translational modifications. These occur in a stress-independent manner and are unrelated to phosphorylation by MAPKs. As revealed by transient expression of AZI1 in Nicotiana benthamiana and Tropaeolum majus, the Arabidopsis protein is similarly modified in heterologous plant species. Proline-rich regions, resembling arabinogalactan proteins point to a possible proline hydroxylation and subsequent O-glycosylation of AZI1. Consistently, inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase reduces its apparent protein size. AZI1 secretion was examined using Arabidopsis protoplasts and seedling exudates. Employing Agrobacterium-mediated leaf infiltration of N. benthamiana, we attempted to assess long-distance movement of AZI1.

Recent work demonstrates an intimate connection between nuclear compartmentalization and gene regulation. Here, we report that Ser62 phosphorylation and PIN1-mediated isomerization of MYC dynamically regulate the spatial distribution of MYC in the nucleus, promoting its association with the inner basket of the nuclear pore in response to proliferative signals, where it recruits the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to bind and regulate local gene acetylation and expression. We demonstrate that PIN1-mediated localization of MYC to the nuclear pore regulates MYC target genes responsive to mitogen stimulation that are involved in proliferation and migration pathways. These changes are also present at the chromatin level, with an increase in open regulatory elements in response to stimulation that is PIN1-dependent and associated with MYC chromatin binding.

Interestingly, ubiquitin (Ub) can be itself modified by other PTMs, including acetylation and phosphorylation. Acetylation of Ub on K6 and K48 represses the formation and elongation of Ub chains. Phosphorylation of Ub happens on multiple sites, S57 and S65 being the most frequently modified in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. In mammals, the PINK1 kinase activates ubiquitin ligase Parkin by phosphorylating S65 of Ub and of the Parkin Ubl domain, which in turn promotes the amplification of autophagy signals necessary for the removal of damaged mitochondria. Similarly, TBK1 phosphorylates the autophagy receptors OPTN and p62 to initiate feedback and feedforward programs for Ub-dependent removal of protein aggregates, mitochondria and pathogens (such as Salmonella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The impact of PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub and TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of autophagy receptors (OPTN and p62) has been recently linked to the development of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respectively. Hence, the post-translational modification of Ub and its receptors can efficiently expand the Ub code and modulate its functions in health and disease. "

However, with the exception of phosphorylation and a handful of other examples, PTMs suffer from a limited number of available training examples and sparsity in protein sequences. Here, proline hydroxylation is taken as an example to compare different methods and evaluate their performance on new experimentally determined sites. As a guide for effective experimental design, predictors require both high specificity and sensitivity. However, the self-reported performance may often not be indicative of prediction quality and detection of new sites is not guaranteed. We have benchmarked seven published hydroxylation site predictors on two newly constructed independent datasets. The self-reported performance is found to widely overestimate the real accuracy measured on independent datasets. No predictor performs better than random on new examples, indicating the refined models do not sufficiently generalize to detect new sites. The number of false positives is high and precision low, in particular for non-collagen proteins whose motifs are not conserved. As hydroxylation site predictors do not generalize for new data, caution is advised when using PTM predictors in the absence of independent evaluations, in particular for highly specific sites involved in signalling."

Here we describe the sequential additive ligation of highly repetitive DNA sequences, their assembly into genes encoding protein-polymers with precisely tunable lengths and compositions, and their end-specific post-translational modification with organic dyes and fluorescent protein domains. Our new Golden Gate-based cloning approach relies on incorporation of only type IIS BsaI restriction enzyme recognition sites using PCR, which allowed us to install ybbR-peptide tags, Sortase c-tags, and cysteine residues onto either end of the repetitive gene polymers without leaving residual cloning scars. The assembled genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using inverse transition cycling (ITC). Characterization by cloud point spectrophotometry, and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with fluorescence detection confirmed successful phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Sfp)-mediated post-translational N-terminal labeling of the protein-polymers with a coenzyme A-647 dye (CoA-647) and simultaneous sortase-mediated C-terminal labeling with a GFP domain containing an N-terminal GG-motif in a one-pot reaction. In a further demonstration, we installed an N-terminal cysteine residue into an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) that was subsequently conjugated to a single chain poly(ethylene glycol)-maleimide (PEG-maleimide) synthetic polymer, noticeably shifting the ELP cloud point. The ability to straightforwardly assemble repetitive DNA sequences encoding ELPs of precisely tunable length and to post-translationally modify them specifically at the N- and C- termini provides a versatile platform for the design and production of multifunctional smart protein-polymeric materials.

Its best studied role involves removal of faulty proteins or those that are not necessary anymore. Aberrations in the ubiquitin system have been implicated in various pathologies including cancer, where specific mutations in E3 ligases such as Mdm2, pVHL, and BRCA1 have been linked to disease progression, prognosis, and resistance to drugs. Yet, there are hundreds of E3 ligases in the human genome and our knowledge of their target proteins and their dynamic regulation in the cellular environment is largely limited. In addition, fundamental questions related to recognition and specificity in ubiquitin conjugation remain unanswered. It is thus of major importance to characterize the ubiquitin landscape under various cellular conditions, and study how the regulatory network is altered in health and disease. To do so, analytical tools that allow identification of ubiquitin substrates, the conjugation and removal of ubiquitin, and the nature of specific ubiquitin linkages that are formed are needed. In this mini-review, we discuss common proteomic methodologies applied to studying the ubiquitome, and specifically focus on our recently developed post-translational modification (PTM) profiling approach. PTM profiling is a functional assay, amenable to biochemical manipulation, which allows the detection of protein modifications in a high-throughput manner. We discuss in detail the advantages and limitations of this system, focusing primarily on examples for analyzing the ubiquitin system in cancer. Uncovering the intricate signaling dynamics governed by and regulating ubiquitin modifications should clearly evolve into a new paradigm in understanding the molecular basis of malignant transformation and the development of novel therapeutic modalities."

Here, we investigated six overexpressed S. cerevisiae protein MTases (Rkm1, Rkm4, Efm4, Efm7, Set5 and Hmt1) to identify PTMs of potential functional relevance. We identified 48 PTM sites across the six MTases, including phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation. Forty-two sites are novel. We contextualized the PTM sites in structural models of the MTases and revealed that many fell in catalytic pockets or enzyme-substrate interfaces. These may regulate MTase activity. Finally, we compared PTMs on Hmt1 with those on its human homologs PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1, PRMT6 and PRMT8. This revealed that several PTMs are conserved from yeast to human, whereas others are only found in Hmt1.

While prior information about more than 20 types of histone PTMs exists, little is known about histone PTM combinations (PTMCs). Because of the combinatorial explosion it is intrinsically impossible to consider all potential PTMCs in a database search. Consequentially, high-scoring false positives with unconsidered but correct alternative isobaric PTMCs can occur. Current quality controls can neither estimate the amount of unconsidered alternatives nor flag potential false positives. Here, we propose a conceptual workflow that provides such options. In this workflow, an in silico modeling of all candidate isoforms with known-to-exist PTMs is made. The most frequently occurring PTM sets of these candidate isoforms are determined and used in several database searches. This suppresses the combinatorial explosion while considering as many candidate isoforms as possible. Finally, annotations can be classified as unique or ambiguous, the latter implying false positives. This workflow was evaluated on an LC-MS data set containing 44 histone extracts. We were able to consider 60% of all candidate isoforms. Importantly, 40% of all annotations were classified as ambiguous. This highlights the need for a more thorough evaluation of modified peptide annotations."

Considering that FRIPS MS supplies a substantial amount of collisional energy to peptides, this result was quite unexpected because a labile phosphate group was conserved. Analysis of the resulting peptide fragments revealed the extensive production of a-, c-, x-, and z-type fragments (with some minor b- and y-type fragments), suggesting that radical-driven peptide fragmentation was the primary mechanism involved in the FRIPS MS of phosphopeptides.

No cure is available for patients diagnosed with these diseases. A prominent feature of both ALS and PD is the accumulation of protein inclusions in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons; however, the particular proteins constituting these inclusions vary: the RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 and FUS are most notable in ALS, while α-synuclein aggregates into Lewy bodies in PD. In both diseases, genetic causes fail to explain the occurrence of a large proportion of cases, and thus, both are considered mostly sporadic. Despite mounting evidence for a possible role of epigenetics in the occurrence and progression of ALS and PD, epigenetic mechanisms in the context of these diseases remain mostly unexplored. Here we comprehensively delineate histone post-translational modification (PTM) profiles in ALS and PD yeast proteinopathy models. Remarkably, we find distinct changes in histone modification profiles for each. We detect the most striking changes in the context of FUS aggregation: changes in several histone marks support a global decrease in gene transcription. We also detect more modest changes in histone modifications in cells overexpressing TDP-43 or α-synuclein. Our results highlight a great need for the inclusion of epigenetic mechanisms in the study of neurodegeneration. We hope our work will pave the way for the discovery of more effective therapies to treat patients suffering from ALS, PD, and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Hyperphosphorylation of tau is linked to its aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While more than 70 phosphorylation sites have been detected previously on NFT tau, studies of oligomeric and detergent-soluble tau in human brains during the early stages of AD are lacking. Here we apply a comprehensive electrochemiluminescence ELISA assay to analyze twenty-five different PTM sites as well as tau oligomerization in control and sporadic AD brain. The samples were classified as Braak stages 0-I, II or III-IV, corresponding to the progression of microscopically detectable tau pathology throughout different brain regions. We found that soluble tau multimers are strongly increased at Braak stages III-IV in all brain regions under investigation, including the temporal cortex, which does not contain NFTs or misfolded oligomers at this stage of pathology. We additionally identified five phosphorylation sites that are specifically and consistently increased across the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporal cortex in the same donors. Three of these sites correlate with tau multimerization in all three brain regions, but do not overlap with the epitopes of phospho-sensitive antibodies commonly used for the immunohistochemical detection of NFTs. Our results thus suggest that soluble multimers are characterized by a small set of specific phosphorylation events that differ from those dominating in mature NFTs.

Among these regulatory signals, two pathways in particular, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, have become of significant interest in several aspects of plant biology, underpinning these molecules as critical regulators during development, cellular differentiation, and plant-pathogen interaction. Recently, redox posttranslational modifications (PTM), such as S-nitrosylation on cysteine residues and tyrosine nitration, have shed light on multiple protein targets, as they are associated with signal networks/downstream metabolic pathways, capable of transducing the imbalance of redox hemostasis and consequently redirecting the biochemical status under stress conditions. However, most of the redox PTM have been studied only in the intracellular compartment, providing limited information concerning redox PTM in the extracellular matrix of plant cells. Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated the plausibility of redox PTM in extracellular proteins, including cell wall associated proteins. Accordingly, in this review, we endeavor to examine evidence of redox PTM supported by mass spectrometry data in the intracellular and extracellular space in plant cells. As a further example, we focus the last section of this review on illustrating, using molecular dynamics simulation, the effect of S-nitrosylation on the structural conformation of well-known cell wall-associated proteins including pectin methylesterase and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylases."

AQP2 undergoes different regulated post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which are fundamental for controlling AQP2 cellular localization, stability, and function. The relationship between AQP2 and S-glutathionylation is of potential interest because reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced under renal failure or nephrotoxic drugs, may influence renal function as well as the expression and the activity of different transporters and channels, including aquaporins. Here, we show for the first time that AQP2 is subjected to S-glutathionylation in kidney and in HEK-293 cells stably expressing AQP2. S-Glutathionylation is a redox-dependent post-translational modification controlling several signal transduction pathways and displaying an acute effect on free cytosolic calcium concentration. Interestingly, we found that in fresh kidney slices, the increased AQP2 S-glutathionylation correlated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced ROS generation. Moreover, we also found that cells expressing wild-type human calcium-sensing receptor (hCaSR-wt) and its gain of function (hCaSR-R990G; hCaSR-N124K) had a significant decrease in AQP2 S-glutathionylation secondary to reduced ROS levels and reduced basal intracellular calcium concentration compared with mock cells. Together, these new findings provide fundamental insight into cell biological aspects of AQP2 function and may be relevant to better understand and explain pathological states characterized by an oxidative stress and AQP2-dependent water reabsorption disturbs.

We found that potent N-hydroxy propenamide-based HDACi induced a concentration dependent decrease in the HDAC1 associated with chromatin and a lasting concomitant increase in cytoplasmic HDAC1 while maintaining total protein expression. No such change occurred with HDAC2 or 8, however, an increase in cytoplasmic non-phosphorylated HDAC3 was also observed. The subcellular re-equilibration of HDAC1 was subsequent to the accumulation of acetylated histones and might be cell cycle dependent.

The human eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), an eosinophil specific granule protein secreted during inflammation and infection, can target a wide variety of pathogens. Previous work in human eosinophil extracts identified several ECP native forms and glycosylation heterogeneity was found to contribute to the protein biological properties. In this study we analyze for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the distinct native proteins purified from healthy donor blood. Low and heavy molecular weight forms were tested on Escherichia coli cell cultures and compared with the recombinant non-glycosylated protein. Further analysis on model membranes provided an insight towards an understanding of the protein behavior at the cytoplasmic membrane level. The results highlight the significant reduction in protein toxicity and bacteria agglutination activity for heavy glycosylated fractions. Notwithstanding, the lower glycosylated fraction mostly retains the lipopolysaccharide binding affinity together with the cytoplasmic membrane depolarization and membrane leakage activities. From structural analysis we propose that heavy glycosylation interferes with the protein self-aggregation, hindering the cell agglutination and membrane disruption processes.

Enrichment of PTMs is often necessary when investigating the PTM status of a target protein, because PTMs are often transient and relatively low in abundance. Many pitfalls are encountered when enriching for a PTM of a target protein, such as buffer incompatibility, the target protein antibody is not IP-compatible, loss of PTM signal, and others. The degree of difficulty is magnified when investigating multiple PTMs like acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation 2/3, and tyrosine phosphorylation for a given target protein. Studying a combination of these PTMs may be necessary, as crosstalk between PTMs is prevalent and critical for protein regulation. Often, these PTMs are studied in different lysis buffers and with unique inhibitor compositions. To simplify the process, a unique denaturing lysis system was developed that effectively isolates and preserves these four PTMs; thus, enabling investigation of potential crosstalk in a single lysis system. A unique filter system was engineered to remove contaminating genomic DNA from the lysate, which is a problematic by-product of denaturing buffers. Robust affinity matrices targeting each of the four PTMs were developed in concert with the buffer system to maximize the enrichment and detection of the endogenous states of these four PTMs. This comprehensive PTM detection toolset streamlines the process of obtaining critical information about whether a protein is modified by one or more of these PTMs."

KgpF modified the tryptophan derivative with a dimethylallyl group at the 3 position of its indole ring, resulting in the formation of a tricyclic structure with the same scaffold as prenylation by ComQ, but with the opposite stereochemistry."

We observed high levels of SbPPC4 (Sb07g014960) transcripts during early development (stage I), and extensive transcript abundance of SbPPC2 (Sb02g021090) and SbPPC3 (Sb04g008720) throughout the entire life cycle of the seed. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of immunopurified PTPC indicated that four different PTPC isoenzymes were expressed in the developing and germinating seeds, SbPPC3 was the most abundant isozyme of the developing seed, and of the embryo and the aleurone layer of germinating seeds. In vivo phosphorylation of the different PTPC isoenzymes at their conserved N-terminal seryl phosphorylation site during germination was also established by MS/MS analysis. Furthermore, three of the four isoenzymes were partially monoubiquitinated, with MS/MS pinpointing SbPPC2 and SbPPC3 monoubiquitination at the conserved Lys-630 and Lys-624 residues, respectively. Our results demonstrate that monoubiquitination and phosphorylation simultaneously occur in vivo with different PTPC isozymes during seed germination. In addition, we show that PTPC monoubiquitination in germinating sorghum seeds always increases at stage II (emergence of the radicle), is maintained during the aerobic period of rapid cell division and reserve mobilization, and remains relatively constant until stage IV-V when coleoptiles initiate the formation of the photosynthetic tissues."

The large number of PTM sites in the Hsp90 proteins that are scattered throughout different domains indicated that synchronization of multiple PTMs through a combinatorial code can be invoked as an important mechanism to orchestrate diverse chaperone functions and recognize multiple client proteins. In this study, we have combined structural and coevolutionary analysis with molecular simulations and perturbation response scanning analysis of the Hsp90 structures to characterize functional role of PTM sites in allosteric regulation. The results reveal a small group of conserved PTMs that act as global mediators of collective dynamics and allosteric communications in the Hsp90 structures, while the majority of flexible PTM sites serve as sensors and carriers of the allosteric structural changes. This study provides a comprehensive structural, dynamic and network analysis of PTM sites across Hsp90 proteins, identifying specific role of regulatory PTM hotspots in the allosteric mechanism of the Hsp90 cycle. We argue that plasticity of a combinatorial PTM code in the Hsp90 may be enacted through allosteric coupling between effector and sensor PTM residues, which would allow for timely response to structural requirements of multiple modified enzymes."

Parkin activity spans from mitochondria quality control to tumor suppression and stress protection; it is thus tempting to hypothesize that the broad impact of Parkin on cellular physiology might be the result of different post translational modifications that can be controlled by balanced opposing events. Sequence alignment of Parkin from different species indicates high homology between domains across Parkin orthologs and identifies highly conserved amino acid residues that, if modified, impinge on Parkin functions. In this review, we summarize findings on post translational modifications that have been shown to affect Parkin activity and stability."

Among the many other co-isolated proteins there are histone chaperones, elements of chromatin remodeling, of nucleosome assembly/disassembly, and of histone modification complexes. The histone chaperone Rtt106p, two members of chromatin assembly FACT complex and Psh1p, an ubiquitin ligase, were the most abundant proteins obtained with both H3-TAP and H4-TAP, regardless of the cell extraction medium stringency. Our mass spectrometry analyses have also revealed numerous novel post-translational modifications, including 30 new chemical modifications in histones, mainly by ubiquitination. We have discovered not only new sites of ubiquitination but that, besides lysine, also serine and threonine residues are targets of ubiquitination on yeast histones. Our results show the standard tandem affinity purification procedure is suitable for application to yeast histones, in order to isolate and characterize histone-binding proteins and post-translational modifications, avoiding the bias caused by histone purification from a chromatin-enriched fraction.

Together with gene diversity, PTMs contribute to the overall variety of possible protein function for a given organism. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of variations found in the human genome, and have been found to be associated with diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), among many others. Studies have also shown that non-synonymous single-nucleotide variation (nsSNV) at the PTM site, which alters the corresponding encoded amino acid in the translated protein sequence, can lead to abnormal activity of a protein and can contribute to a disease phenotype. Significant advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and high-throughput proteomics have resulted in the generation of a huge amount of data for both SNPs and PTMs. However, these data are unsystematically distributed across a number of diverse databases. Thus, there is a need for efforts toward data standardization and validation of bioinformatics algorithms that can fully leverage SNP and PTM information for biomedical research. In this book chapter, we will present some of the commonly used databases for both SNVs and PTMs and describe a broad approach that can be applied to many scenarios for studying the impact of nsSNVs on PTM sites of human proteins."

A central technology for global quantitative PTM analysis, mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics, is biased toward trypsin due to its high activity and specificity. This bias becomes a problem when a PTM is located at or near tryptic cleavage sites, in which case the PTM might block recognition by trypsin, resulting in missed cleavage and sequence coverage gaps.

PTMs, however, may interact or interfere with one another when regulating protein function. Yet, characterization of the structural and functional signatures of their crosstalk has been hindered by the scarcity of data. To this end, we developed a unified sequence-based predictor of 23 types of PTM sites that, we believe, is a useful tool in guiding biological experiments and data interpretation. We then used experimentally determined and predicted PTM sites to investigate two particular cases of potential PTM crosstalk in eukaryotes. First, we identified proteins statistically enriched in multiple types of PTM sites and found that they show preferences toward intrinsically disordered regions as well as functional roles in transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and developmental processes. Second, we observed that target sites modified by more than one type of PTM, referred to as shared PTM sites, show even stronger preferences toward disordered regions than their single-PTM counterparts; we explain this by the need for these regions to accommodate multiple partners. Finally, we investigated the influence of single and shared PTMs on differential regulation of protein-protein interactions. We provide evidence that molecular recognition features (MoRFs) show significant preferences for PTM sites, particularly shared PTM sites, implicating PTMs in the modulation of this specific type of macromolecular recognition. We conclude that intrinsic disorder is a strong structural prerequisite for complex PTM-based regulation, particularly in context-dependent protein-protein interactions related to transcriptional and developmental processes."

The activity of nucleolin is regulated by intracellular localization and post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a category of recently verified forms of post-translational modifications and exerts various effects on the target proteins. In the studies reported here, we discovered SUMOylational modification of human nucleolin protein at Lys-294, which facilitated the mRNA binding property of nucleolin by maintaining its nuclear localization. In response to arsenic exposure, nucleolin-SUMO was induced and promoted its binding with gadd45α mRNA, which increased gadd45α mRNA stability and protein expression, subsequently causing GADD45α-mediated cell death. On the other hand, ectopic expression of Mn-SOD attenuated the arsenite-generated superoxide radical level, abrogated nucleolin-SUMO, and in turn inhibited arsenite-induced apoptosis by reducing GADD45α expression. Collectively, our results for the first time demonstrate that nucleolin-SUMO at K294R plays a critical role in its nucleus sequestration and gadd45α mRNA binding activity. This novel biological function of nucleolin is distinct from its conventional role as a proto-oncogene. Therefore, our findings here not only reveal a new modification of nucleolin protein and its novel functional paradigm in mRNA metabolism but also expand our understanding of the dichotomous roles of nucleolin in terms of cancer development, which are dependent on multiple intracellular conditions and consequently the appropriate regulations of its modifications, including SUMOylation.

Such labels can simultaneously bind with all the modified amino acids in a target protein, resulting in a large signal. However, if the small-molecule labels are previously attached with a macromolecule comparable to the target protein in size, binding of one such label will prevent subsequent binding of more labels of its kind; thus, only one of the modified amino acids in the target protein can be bound with the label, resulting in a small signal. Therefore, the stoichiometric number of PTM can be determined by a ratio of the two signals. The proposed method can analyze nitration of several essential regulatory proteins of cellular life, all of which are found to have an integer stoichiometric number indicating regulated site-specific nitration. These results validate the efficacy of our method to provide detailed information on PTMs with biological significance. "

The interactions between RNA and RBPs are implicated in many roles of biochemical processing by the cell such as localization, protein translation, and RNA stability. Recent discoveries of novel mechanisms that are of significant evolutionary advantage between RBPs and RNA include the interaction of the RBP with the 3' and 5' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA. These mechanisms are shown to function through interaction of a trans-factor (RBP) and a cis-regulatory element (3' or 5' UTR) by the binding of a RBP to a regulatory-consensus nucleic acid motif region that is conserved throughout evolution. Through signal transduction, regulatory RBPs are able to temporarily dissociate from their target sites on mRNAs and induce translation, typically through a post-translational modification (PTM). These small, regulatory motifs located in the UTR of mRNAs are subject to a loss-of-function due to single polymorphisms or other mutations that disrupt the motif and inhibit the ability to associate into the complex with RBPs. The identification of a consensus motif for a given RBP is difficult, time consuming, and requires a significant degree of experimentation to identify each motif-containing gene on a genomic scale. We have developed a computational algorithm to analyze high-throughput genomic arrays that contain differential binding induced by a PTM for a RBP of interest-RBP-PTM Target Scan (RPTS). We demonstrate the ability of this application to accurately predict a PTM-specific binding motif to an RBP that has no antibody capable of distinguishing the PTM of interest, negating the use of in-vitro exonuclease digestion techniques.

Although hyperphosphorylation of tau serine and threonine residues is an established trigger of tau misfunction and aggregation, tau modifications extend to lysine residues as well, raising the possibility that different modification signatures depress or promote aggregation propensity depending on site occupancy. To identify lysine residue modifications associated with normal tau function, soluble tau proteins isolated from four cognitively normal human brains were characterized by MS methods. The major detectable lysine modification was found to be methylation, which appeared in the form of mono- and di-methyl lysine residues distributed among at least 11 sites. Unlike tau phosphorylation sites, the frequency of lysine methylation was highest in the microtubule-binding repeat region that mediates both microtubule binding and homotypic interactions. When purified recombinant human tau was modified in vitro through reductive methylation, its ability to promote tubulin polymerization was retained, whereas its aggregation propensity was greatly attenuated at both nucleation and extension steps. These data establish lysine methylation as part of the normal tau post-translational modification signature in human brain, and suggest that it can function in part to protect against pathological tau aggregation."

PTM-based modulation of the NLS binding affinity to the import receptor is one of the most understood mechanisms to regulate nuclear import of proteins. However, identification of such regulation mechanisms is challenging due to the difficulty of assessing the impact of PTM on corresponding nuclear import activities. In this study we proposed NIpredict, an effective algorithm to predict nuclear import activity given its NLS, in which molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) were used to characterize the NLS-import receptor interaction, and the support vector regression machine (SVR) was used to learn the relationship between the characterized NLS-import receptor interaction and the corresponding nuclear import activity. Our experiments showed that nuclear import activity change due to NLS change could be accurately predicted by the NIpredict algorithm. Based on NIpredict, we developed a systematic framework to identify potential PTM-based nuclear import regulations for human and yeast nuclear proteins. Application of this approach has identified the potential nuclear import regulation mechanisms by phosphorylation of two nuclear proteins including SF1 and ORC6."

In particular, we find that TG2 loss of function correlates with a defect in the nuclear translocation of HSF1 and in its DNA-binding ability to the HSP70 promoter. We show that the inhibition of TG2 restores the unbalance in HSF1-HSP70 pathway in cystic fibrosis (CF), a human disorder characterized by deregulation of proteostasis. The absence of TG2 leads to an increase of about 40% in CFTR function in a new experimental CF mouse model lacking TG2.

There is also growing evidence that proteolytic cleavage of histone N-terminal tails, known as histone clipping, influences nucleosome dynamics and functional properties. Using top-down and middle-down protein analysis by mass spectrometry, we report histone H2B and H3 N-terminal tail clipping in human hepatocytes and demonstrate a relationship between clipping and co-existing PTMs of histone H3. Histones H2B and H3 undergo proteolytic processing in primary human hepatocytes and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2/C3A when grown in spheroid (3D) culture, but not in a flat (2D) culture. Using tandem mass spectrometry we localized four different clipping sites in H3 and one clipping site in H2B. We show that in spheroid culture clipped H3 proteoforms are mainly represented by canonical histone H3, whereas in primary hepatocytes over 90% of clipped H3 correspond to the histone variant H3.3. Comprehensive analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed a series of PTMs, including K14me1, K27me2/K27me3, and K36me1/me2, which are differentially abundant in clipped and intact H3. Analysis of co-existing PTMs revealed negative crosstalk between H3K36 methylation and H3K23 acetylation in clipped H3. Our data provide the first evidence of histone clipping in human hepatocytes and demonstrate that clipped H3 carry distinct co-existing PTMs different from those in intact H3. "

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a pathogen from Herpesvirus family, possesses two well conserved proteins, BFRF1 and BFLF2, which together form the heterodimeric nuclear egress complex (NEC) that is involved in the early steps of nuclear egress.

Altogether, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which EBV exploits the cellular machinery for nucleocapsid egress."

Targeting both enzyme-substrate contacts and PTMs for peptide formation and detection, we devised flow-and-detergent-facilitated protease and de-PTM digestions for deep sequencing (FDD) method that combined omni-compatible detergent, tandem immobilized protease/PNGase columns, and Cys-selective reduction/alkylation, to achieve streamlined ultradeep peptide preparation within minutes not days, at high peptide reproducibility and low abundance-bias. FDD transformed enzyme-protein contacts into equal catalytic travel paths through enzyme-excessive columns regardless of protein abundance, removed products instantly preventing inhibition, tackled intricate structures via sequential multiple micro-digestions along the flow, and precisely controlled peptide formation by flow rate. Peptide-stage reactions reduced steric bias; low contamination deepened MS/MS scan; distinguishing disulfide from M oxidation and avoiding gain/loss artifacts unmasked protein-endogenous oxidation states. Using a recent interactome of 285-kDa human GABA type A receptor, this pilot study validated FDD platform's applicability to deep sequencing (up to 99% coverage), H/D-exchange and TMT-based structural mapping.

In this study, we show that in the phytopathogen, insect-vectored Spiroplasma citri GII-3 adhesion-related protein (ScARP) adhesins are post-translationally processed through an ATP-dependent targeted cleavage. The cleavage efficiency could be enhanced in vitro when decreasing the extracellular pH or upon the addition of polyclonal antibodies directed against ScARP repeated units, suggesting that modification of the surface charge and/or ScARP conformational changes could initiate the cleavage. The two major sites for primary cleavage are localized within predicted disordered regions and do not fit any previously reported cleavage motif; in addition, the inhibition profile and the metal ion requirements indicate that this post-translational modification involves at least one non-conventional protease. Such a proteolytic process may play a role in S. citri colonization of cells of the host insect.

In this study, we focused upon the common ALS4 mutation, L389S, by performing yeast two-hybrid screens of a human brain expression library with control senataxin or L389S senataxin as bait. Interacting clones identified from the two screens were collated, and redundant hits and false positives subtracted to yield a set of 13 protein interactors. Among these hits, we discovered a highly specific and reproducible interaction of L389S senataxin with a peptide encoded by the antisense sequence of a brain-specific non-coding RNA, known as BCYRN1. We further found that L389S senataxin interacts with other proteins containing regions of conserved homology with the BCYRN1 reverse complement-encoded peptide, suggesting that such aberrant protein interactions may contribute to L389S ALS4 disease pathogenesis. As the yeast two-hybrid screen also demonstrated senataxin self-association, we confirmed senataxin dimerization via its amino-terminal binding domain and determined that the L389S mutation does not abrogate senataxin self-association. Finally, based upon detection of interactions between senataxin and ubiquitin-SUMO pathway modification enzymes, we examined senataxin for the presence of ubiquitin and SUMO monomers, and observed this post-translational modification. Our senataxin protein interaction study reveals a number of features of senataxin biology that shed light on senataxin normal function and likely on senataxin molecular pathology in ALS4. "

Our analysis revealed a total of 52 post-translational modifications in AAV2-AAVrh10 capsids, including ubiquitination (17%), glycosylation (36%), phosphorylation (21%), SUMOylation (13%) and acetylation (11%). While AAV1 had no detectable post-translational modification, at least four AAV serotypes had >7 post-translational modifications in their capsid protein. About 82% of these post-translational modifications are novel. A limited validation of AAV2 capsids by MALDI-TOF and western blot analysis demonstrated minimal glycosylation and ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids. To further validate this, we disrupted a glycosylation site identified in AAV2 capsid (AAV2-N253Q), which severely compromised its packaging efficiency (~ 100-fold vs. AAV2 wild-type vectors). In order to confirm other post-translational modifications detected such as SUMOylation, mutagenesis of a SUMOylation site(K258Q) in AAV2 was performed. This mutant vector demonstrated reduced levels of SUMO-1/2/3 proteins and negligible transduction, 2 weeks after ocular gene transfer. Our study underscores the heterogeneity of post-translational modifications in AAV vectors. The data presented here, should facilitate further studies to understand the biological relevance of post-translational modifications in AAV life cycle and the development of novel bioengineered AAV vectors for gene therapy applications.

Further work has been focused on the molecular mechanisms that dictate the successive post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation by OST, deglycosylation by NGLY, and ubiquitination by Hrd1) of this CNC-bZIP protein and its proteolytic processing to give rise to multiple proteoforms. Several lines of experimental evidence have demonstrated that the nascent Nrf1α/TCF11 polypeptide (non-glycosylated) is transiently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which it becomes an inactive glycoprotein-A, and is folded in a proper topology within and around membranes. Thereafter, dynamic repositioning of the ER-resident domains in Nrf1 glycoprotein is driven by p97-fueled retrotranslocation into extra-ER compartments. Therein, Nrf1 glycoprotein is allowed for deglycosylation digestion by glycosidases into a deglycoprotein-B and its progressive proteolytic processing by cytosolic DDI-1/2 and proteasomes so as to generate N-terminally-truncated protein-C/D. This processing is accompanied by removal of a major N-terminal ~12.5-kDa polypeptide from Nrf1α. Interestingly, our present study has further unraveled that there exist coupled positive and negative feedback circuits between Nrf1 and cognate target genes, including those encoding its regulators p97, Hrd1, DDI-1 and proteasomes. These key players are differentially or even oppositely involved in diverse cellular signaling responses to distinct extents of ER-derived proteotoxic and oxidative stresses induced by different concentrations of proteasomal inhibitors."

However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to maladaptive plasticity in the cortex and how they contribute to the development of neuropathic pain. AMPA-type glutamate receptors (GluARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain and play an important role in pain processing. Here we used an electrolytic lesion model of spinal cord injury in animals to study the expression and phosphorylation of GluA1 and 2 in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Experiments in rats and mice revealed that maladaptive plasticity and hypersensitivity after spinal cord lesion (SCL) are associated with a reduction in the fraction of GluA1 subunits that are phosphorylated at serine 831 (S831) in the hindlimb representation of S1 (S1HL). Manipulations that reduce the fraction of phosphorylated S831 in S1HL of non-lesioned animals, including low-frequency electrical stimulation and viral-mediated gene transfer of mutant S831, were associated with the development of hypersensitivity. Taken together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of GluA1 at S831 plays an important role in the development of hypersensitivity after SCL. "

Identification of PTMs and the sites of modifications of these secreted proteins remain as an essential but unexploited step to understand the biomass degradation mechanism. Therefore, this study applied electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) for glycopeptides enrichment and coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for glycosylated secreted enzymes of P. chrysosporium during glucose, cellulose, and lignin degradation. Varied groups of enzymes, including cellulases, glycoside hydrolases, hemicellulases, lignin-degrading enzymes, were glycosylated. The comparisons of the glycosylated secreted enzymes of P. chrysosporium in glucose, cellulose, and lignin culture conditions revealed glycosylation as substrate-dependent PTMs. "

The zinc finger protein GATA4 is one such transcription factor involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In response to hypertrophic stimuli such as those involving the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, changes in protein interaction and/or post-translational modifications of GATA4 cause hypertrophic gene transcription in cardiomyocytes.

Increasingly, determination of protein identity, estimation of abundance, and characterization of post-translational modifications are required for analysis of protein-mediated cell signaling networks. As such, we report an integrated and rapid multispectral immunoprobed isoelectric focusing technique for identifying specific proteins bearing post-translational modifications. Immunoprobed isoelectric focusing is composed of isoelectric focusing in a large pore-size polyacrylamide gel to determine protein pI followed by immobilization of pI-resolved proteins. Proteins are immobilized via covalent attachment to a channel-filling benzophenone-functionalized polyacrylamide gel via brief UV exposure (photoblot), followed by multispectral antibody-based detection. The assay correlates observed post-translational modifications to pI shifts relative to the unmodified protein of interest. During the electrokinetically driven antibody probing stage, we observed nonuniform electrophoretic probe mobility along the channel axis. The spatially varying mobility is attributed to nonuniform charge arising from covalent attachment of ampholytes to the benzophenone-functionalized gel matrix during the photoblotting step. Using the multistep microfluidic assay, phosphorylated and acetylated forms of heat shock protein 27 and superoxide dismutase 2 were detected, respectively. The assay reported protein isoforms in immune-purified sample and raw cell lysate in 2 hours with sample volume requirements of 2 μL. This new assay is well-matched to systems biology frameworks for study of protein post-translational modifications."

This cofactor is located in the α-subunit at the interfacial active site of the heterodimeric enzyme. Unlike canonical NHases, toyocamycin nitrile hydratase (TNHase) from Streptomyces rimosus is a unique three-subunit member of this family involved in the biosynthesis of pyrrolopyrimidine antibiotics. The subunits of TNHase are homologous to the α- and β-subunits of prototypical NHases. Herein we report the expression, purification, and characterization of the α-subunit of TNHase. The UV-visible, EPR, and mass spectra of the α-subunit TNHase provide evidence that this subunit alone is capable of synthesizing the active site complex with full post-translational modifications. Remarkably, the isolated post-translationally modified α-subunit is also catalytically active with the natural substrate, toyocamycin, as well as the niacin precursor 3-cyanopyridine. Comparisons of the steady state kinetic parameters of the single subunit variant to the heterotrimeric protein clearly show that the additional subunits impart substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. We conclude that the α-subunit is the minimal sequence needed for nitrile hydration providing a simplified scaffold to study the mechanism and post-translational modification of this important class of catalysts.

The functional effect of protein-coding variants is often predicted using sequence conservation and population frequency data, however other factors are likely relevant. We hypothesized that variants in protein post-translational modification (PTM) sites contribute to phenotype variation and disease. We analyzed fraction of rare variants and non-synonymous to synonymous variant ratio (Ka/Ks) in 7,500 human genomes and found a significant negative selection signal in PTM regions independent of six factors, including conservation, codon usage, and GC-content, that is widely distributed across tissue-specific genes and function classes. PTM regions are also enriched in known disease mutations, suggesting that PTM variation is more likely deleterious. PTM constraint also affects flanking sequence around modified residues and increases around clustered sites, indicating presence of functionally important short linear motifs. Using target site motifs of 124 kinases, we predict that at least ∼180,000 motif-breaker amino acid residues that disrupt PTM sites when substituted, and highlight kinase motifs that show specific negative selection and enrichment of disease mutations. We provide this dataset with corresponding hypothesized mechanisms as a community resource. As an example of our integrative approach, we propose that PTPN11 variants in Noonan syndrome aberrantly activate the protein by disrupting an uncharacterized cluster of phosphorylation sites. Further, as PTMs are molecular switches that are modulated by drugs, we study mutated binding sites of PTM enzymes in disease genes and define a drug-disease network containing 413 novel predicted disease-gene links.

Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) plays an indispensable role in macroautophagy formation and is a molecular marker for the process. Here, we show that autophagy increased through quick robust signaling from starvation by enhanced levels of LC3, LC3-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) punctate, and bulk proteolysis in rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells and fresh rat hepatocytes. After the addition of amino acids to the starvation condition, a similar quick signal appeared by significant reduction of the LC3 ratio and bulk proteolysis. Interestingly, we observed that post-translational modification of LC3 conversion occurred even long before the changes happened in the level of LC3-mRNA (messenger RNA) expression. A similar coordinated but diverse effect on LC3 was confirmed by using autophagy and lysosomal inhibitors. These results indicated that during starvation the initial robust signal to the cytoplasm can induce autophagy activity through modification at the protein level, whereas after depleting readily available autophagy proteins the signal goes to the DNA transcription level to maintain the autophagy capacity of cells.

A reverse genetics approach investigated the function of the putative four-gene modification locus. All mutants were found to have truncated glycan structures by LC-MS/MS, taking into account bioinformatic analysis, we propose that the open reading frame CD0241 encodes a kinase involved in the transfer of the phosphate to the threonine, the CD0242 protein catalyses the addition of the phosphothreonine to the N-acetylglucosamine moiety and CD0243 transfers the methyl group to the threonine. Some mutations affected motility and caused cells to aggregate to each other and abiotic surfaces. Altering the structure of the flagellin modification impacted on colonization and disease recurrence in a murine model of infection, showing that alterations in the surface architecture of C. difficile vegetative cells can play a significant role in disease. We show that motility is not a requirement for colonization, but that colonization was compromised when the glycan structure was incomplete. "

For this 10th anniversary of dbPTM, the updated resource provides not only a comprehensive dataset of experimentally verified PTMs, supported by the literature, but also an integrative interface for accessing all available databases and tools that are associated with PTM analysis. As well as collecting experimental PTM data from 14 public databases, this update manually curates over 12 000 modified peptides, including the emerging S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation and succinylation, from approximately 500 research articles, which were retrieved by text mining. As the number of available PTM prediction methods increases, this work compiles a non-homologous benchmark dataset to evaluate the predictive power of online PTM prediction tools. An increasing interest in the structural investigation of PTM substrate sites motivated the mapping of all experimental PTM peptides to protein entries of Protein Data Bank (PDB) based on database identifier and sequence identity, which enables users to examine spatially neighboring amino acids, solvent-accessible surface area and side-chain orientations for PTM substrate sites on tertiary structures. Since drug binding in PDB is annotated, this update identified over 1100 PTM sites that are associated with drug binding. The update also integrates metabolic pathways and protein-protein interactions to support the PTM network analysis for a group of proteins.

PTMs of multiple residues on one protein may work together to determine a functional outcome, which is known as PTM cross-talk. Identification of PTM cross-talks is an emerging theme in proteomics and has elicited great interest, but their properties remain to be systematically characterized. To this end, we collected 193 PTM cross-talk pairs in 77 human proteins from the literature and then tested location preference and co-evolution at the residue and modification levels. We found that cross-talk events preferentially occurred among nearby PTM sites, especially in disordered protein regions, and cross-talk pairs tended to co-evolve. Given the properties of PTM cross-talk pairs, a naïve Bayes classifier integrating different features was built to predict cross-talks for pairwise combination of PTM sites. By using a 10-fold cross-validation, the integrated prediction model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.833, superior to using any individual feature alone. The prediction performance was also demonstrated to be robust to the biases in the collected PTM cross-talk pairs.

These motifs were used to construct Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that predicted 663 CTD-containing proteins in 21 fully sequenced species of the Bacteroidetes phylum, while no CTD-containing proteins were predicted in species outside this phylum. Further HMM searching of Cytophaga hutchinsonii led to a total of 171 predicted CTD proteins in that organism alone. Proteomic analyses of membrane fractions and culture fluid derived from P. gingivalis and four other species containing predicted CTDs (Parabacteroides distasonis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and C. hutchinsonii) demonstrated that membrane localization, extensive post-translational modification, and CTD-cleavage were conserved features of the secretion system. The CTD cleavage site of 10 different proteins from 3 different species was determined and found to be similar to the cleavage site previously determined in P. gingivalis, suggesting that homologues of the C-terminal signal peptidase (PG0026) are responsible for the cleavage in these species.

A primary mechanism of reactive aldehyde detoxification by hepatocytes is through GSTA4-driven enzymatic conjugation with GSH. Given reports that oxidative stress initiates GSTA4 translocation to the mitochondria, we hypothesized that increased hepatocellular damage in ethanol (EtOH)-fed GSTA4(-/-) mice is due to enhanced mitochondrial protein modification by reactive aldehydes. Chronic ingestion of EtOH increased hepatic protein carbonylation in GSTA4(-/-) mice as evidenced by increased 4-HNE and MDA immunostaining in the hepatic periportal region. Using mass spectrometric analysis of biotin hydrazide conjugated carbonylated proteins, a total of 829 proteins were identified in microsomal, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Of these, 417 were novel to EtOH models. Focusing on mitochondrial fractions, 1.61-fold more carbonylated proteins were identified in EtOH-fed GSTA4(-)(/-) mice compared to their respective WT mice ingesting EtOH. Bioinformatic KEGG pathway analysis of carbonylated proteins from the mitochondrial fractions revealed an increased propensity for modification of proteins regulating oxidative phosphorylation, glucose, fatty acid, glutathione and amino acid metabolic processes in GSTA4(-/-) mice. Additional analysis revealed sites of reactive aldehyde protein modification on 26 novel peptides/proteins isolated from either SV/GSTA4(-/-) PF or EtOH fed mice. Among the peptides/proteins identified, ACSL, ACOX2, MTP, and THIKB contribute to regulation of fatty acid metabolism and ARG1, ARLY, and OAT, which regulate nitrogen and ammonia metabolism having direct relevance to ethanol-induced liver injury.

In the present study, we show that human PABP1 is subject to elaborate post-translational modification, identifying 14 modifications located throughout the functional domains, all but one of which are conserved in mouse. Intriguingly, PABP1 contains glutamate and aspartate methylations, modifications of unknown function in eukaryotes, as well as lysine and arginine methylations, and lysine acetylations. The latter dramatically alter the pI of PABP1, an effect also observed during the cell cycle, suggesting that different biological processes/stimuli can regulate its modification status, although PABP1 also probably exists in differentially modified subpopulations within cells. Two lysine residues were differentially acetylated or methylated, revealing that PABP1 may be the first example of a cytoplasmic protein utilizing a 'methylation/acetylation switch'. Modelling using available structures implicates these modifications in regulating interactions with individual PAM2 (PABP-interacting motif 2)-containing proteins, suggesting a direct link between PABP1 modification status and the formation of distinct mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) complexes that regulate mRNA fate in the cytoplasm."

Dissecting such a code in physiological and diseased states may be exploited for epigenetic biomarker discovery, but hPTM analysis in clinical samples has been hindered by technical limitations. Here, we developed a method (PAThology tissue analysis of Histones by Mass Spectrometry - PAT-H-MS) that allows to perform a comprehensive, unbiased and quantitative MS-analysis of hPTM patterns on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. In pairwise comparisons, histone extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues showed patterns similar to fresh frozen samples for 24 differentially modified peptides from histone H3. In addition, when coupled with a histone-focused version of the super-SILAC approach, this method allows the accurate quantification of modification changes among breast cancer patient samples. As an initial application of the PAThology tissue analysis of Histones by Mass Spectrometry method, we analyzed breast cancer samples, revealing significant changes in histone H3 methylation patterns among Luminal A-like and Triple Negative disease subtypes. These results pave the way for retrospective epigenetic studies that combine the power of MS-based hPTM analysis with the extensive clinical information associated with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archives.

Although current state-of-the-art blind PTM spectral analysis algorithms can predict thousands of modified peptides (PTM predictions) in an MS/MS experiment, a significant percentage of these predictions have inaccurate modification mass estimates and false modification site assignments. This problem can be addressed by post-processing the PTM predictions with a PTM refinement algorithm. We developed a novel PTM refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs in the input data. The use of this new modeling approach enables iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictions."

Prolyl 3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1), the enzyme responsible for converting proline to 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp) in type I collagen, requires the coenzyme CRTAP for activity. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the Crtap-/- mouse was missing 3-hydroxyproline in type I collagen α-chains. This finding led to the discovery of mutations in genes encoding the P3H1 complex as a cause of recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). Since then, many additional 3Hyp sites have been identified in various collagen types and classified based on observed substrate and tissue specificity. P3H1 is part of a family of gene products that also includes isoenzymes P3H2 and P3H3 as well as CRTAP and Sc65. It is believed these isoenzymes and coenzyme proteins have evolved different collagen substrate site and tissue specificities in their activities. The post-translational fingerprinting of collagens will be essential in understanding the basic role and extent of regulated variations of prolyl 3-hydroxylation in collagen. We believe that prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a functionally significant collagen post-translational modification and can be a cause of disease when absent."

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of innate sensors and downstream signaling molecules influence their activity and function by inducing their covalent linkage to new functional groups. PTMs including phosphorylation and polyubiquitination have been shown to potently regulate innate inflammatory responses through the activation, cellular translocation, and interaction of innate receptors, adaptors, and downstream signaling molecules in response to infectious and dangerous signals. Other PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, and succinylation are increasingly implicated in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation.

The PTMs on these peptides include lysine mono- (me1), di- (me2), and tri-methylation (me3); lysine acetylation; arginine me1; serine/threonine phosphorylation; and N-terminal acetylation. The library was subjected to chemical derivatization with propionic anhydride, a widely employed protocol for histone peptide quantification. Subsequently, the detection efficiencies were quantified using mass spectrometry extracted ion chromatograms. The library yields a wide spectrum of detection efficiencies, with more than 1700-fold difference between the peptides with the lowest and highest efficiencies. In this paper, we describe the impact of different modifications on peptide detection efficiencies and provide a resource to correct for detection biases among the 93 histone peptides. In brief, there is no correlation between detection efficiency and molecular weight, hydrophobicity, basicity, or modification type. The same types of modifications may have very different effects on detection efficiencies depending on their positions within a peptide. We also observed antagonistic effects between modifications. In a study of mouse trophoblast stem cells, we utilized the detection efficiencies of the peptide library to correct for histone PTM/variant quantification. For most histone peptides examined, the corrected data did not change the biological conclusions but did alter the relative abundance of these peptides. For a low-abundant histone H2A variant, macroH2A, the corrected data led to a different conclusion than the uncorrected data. The peptide library and detection efficiencies presented here may serve as a resource to facilitate studies in the epigenetics and proteomics fields. "

Therefore, the phosphorylation of histones in apoptosis is not fully understood. It was recently demonstrated by Tang et al. that histones are released from nucleosome during apoptosis, an observation that is in agreement with our findings. In addition to the release of histones, the dephosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr-3 and Ser-10 was observed during apoptosis in some cancer cells. Our data suggest that the modification and release of histones could serve markers of apoptosis in human cancer cells. We also suggest that the released histones, especially H3, could be translocated to mitochondria during apoptosis. "

Cell biology and biochemistry studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that human serum contains potent chemotactic signals significantly impaired by activated TG2. Bioinformatics studies indicated that one potent serum factor potential substrate of TG2-dependent transamidation is platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Cell biology and immunometric experiments carried out with U87MG human glioma cell line showed that human recombinant PDGF-BB pre-incubated with calcium-activated TG2 lost about 70 % of its chemotactic activity and antigenicity. These data indicate that PDGF-BB is a substrate of TG2-transamidating activity, and such modification may play a key role in the modulation of PDGF's chemotactic features.

In times of high purine demand, the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway is activated; however, the mechanisms that facilitate this process are largely unknown. One plausible mechanism is through intracellular signaling, which results in enzymes within the pathway becoming post-translationally modified to enhance their individual enzyme activities and the overall pathway metabolic flux. Here, we employ a proteomic strategy to investigate the extent to which de novo purine biosynthetic pathway enzymes are post-translationally modified in 293T cells. We identified 7 post-translational modifications on 135 residues across the 6 human pathway enzymes. We further asked whether there were differences in the post-translational modification state of each pathway enzyme isolated from cells cultured in the presence or absence of purines. Of the 174 assigned modifications, 67% of them were only detected in one experimental growth condition in which a significant number of serine and threonine phosphorylations were noted. A survey of the most-probable kinases responsible for these phosphorylation events uncovered a likely AKT phosphorylation site at residue Thr397 of PPAT, which was only detected in cells under purine-supplemented growth conditions. These data suggest that this modification might alter enzyme activity or modulate its interaction(s) with downstream pathway enzymes. Together, these findings propose a role for post-translational modifications in pathway regulation and activation to meet intracellular purine demand."

We previously reported that knockdown of nestin expression in human glioblastoma cells suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the present study, we examined the effect of nestin on stemness, and identified molecules involved in modulating nestin function in glioblastoma cells. Nestin expression was shown to be higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. Furthermore, compared with control cells, nestin short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transfected glioblastoma cells exhibited reduced sphere formation, decreased expression of NANOG, N-cadherin, CD133, and Oct-4, and decreased tumor size in vivo. To examine the proteins regulated by nestin in glioblastomas, we carried out two-dimensional electrophoresis using nestin shRNA-transfected glioblastoma cells. As a result, nestin shRNA-transfected glioblastoma cells exhibited a decrease in the level of phosphorylation of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC71; gene HSPA8). From immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated the direct binding of nestin, HSC71, and cyclin D1 in vitro. Overexpression of nestin in glioblastoma cells increased cell growth, sphere formation, and cell invasion. Transfection with HSC71 siRNA restored nestin expression and cell behavior; therefore, HSC71 knockdown will interfere with enhanced tumorigenic properties of glioblastoma cells that ectopically overexpress nestin. We have demonstrated that HSC71 and nestin regulate each other's expression levels or patterns, and that cyclin D1 is located downstream of nestin and HSC71. In conclusion, nestin regulates stemness, cell growth, and invasion in glioblastoma cells through the alteration of HSC71. Inhibition of nestin and HSC71 may thus be a useful molecular target in the treatment of glioblastomas. "

Our results indicated that Mtp-proteins are significantly more inclined to participate in disease than proteins carrying no known PTM sites. Mtp-proteins were found significantly enriched in protein complexes, having more protein partners and preferred to act as hubs/superhubs in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. They possess a distinct functional focus, such as chromatin assembly or disassembly, and reside in biased, multiple subcellular localizations. Moreover, most Mtp-proteins harbor more intrinsically disordered regions than the others. Mtp-proteins carrying PTM types biased toward locating in the ordered regions were mainly related to protein-DNA complex assembly. Examination of the energetic effects of PTMs on the stability of PPI revealed that only a small fraction of single PTM events influence the binding energy of >2 kcal/mol, whereas the binding energy can change dramatically by combinations of multiple PTM types. Our work not only expands the understanding of Mtp-proteins but also discloses the potential ability of Mtp-proteins to act as key elements in disease development. "

Non-enzymatic glycation, which refers to the spontaneous binding of reducing sugars to free amino groups, is increased in diabetes mellitus because of hyperglycemia and is amplified by oxidative processes ('glycoxidation'). Glycoxidation leads to the formation of 'advanced glycation end products' (AGEs), together with products of other oxidative pathways. AGEs alter tissue organization and cell-protein interactions, mainly in the case of long-lived extracellular matrix proteins, and interact with membrane receptors, among which RAGE (receptor of AGEs), a multiligand receptor which triggers intracellular signaling pathways stimulating inflammatory functions. Another major protein modification, carbamylation, is increased in chronic renal failure, which may occur during the course of diabetes mellitus. Carbamylation is due to the binding of isocyanic acid on the α-NH2 extremity of proteins or amino acids, or on ε-NH2 lysine groups, generating homocitrulline, a potential biomarker in atherosclerosis. Isocyanic acid is formed in vivo either by spontaneous dissociation of urea or by myeloperoxidase action on thiocyanate. Carbamylated proteins exhibit altered properties. For example, carbamylated collagen is unable to stimulate oxidative functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils but increases matrix metalloproteinase-9 production by monocytes. Lipoprotein functions are altered by carbamylation and may contribute to atherogenesis. Thus, the numerous PTMDPs may be considered both hallmarks of protein damage in chronic diseases and endogenous toxins acting at the molecular and cellular levels."

A new finding is that enzymes are able to exert chemical modifications on the peptide-templated AuNCs and quench their fluorescence, which furnishes the development of a real-time and label-free sensing strategy for PTM enzymes. Two PTM enzymes, histone deacetylase 1 and protein kinase A, have been employed to demonstrate the feasibility of this enzyme-responsive fluorescent nanocluster beacon. The results reveal that the AuNCs' fluorescence can be dynamically decreased with increasing concentration of the enzymes, and subpicomolar detection limits are readily achieved for both enzymes. The developed strategy can thus offer a useful, label-free biosensor platform for the detection of protein-modifying enzymes and their inhibitors in biomedical applications. "

Although post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are commonly found to modify protein function in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, PTMs such as lysine acetylation have not been examined in P. gingivalis. Lysine acetylation is the addition of an acetyl group to a lysine which removes this amino acid's positive charge and can induce changes in a protein's secondary structure and reactivity. A proteomics based approach combining immune-affinity enrichment with high sensitivity Orbitrap mass spectrometry identified 130 lysine acetylated peptides from 92 P. gingivalis proteins. The majority of these peptides (71) were attributed to 45 proteins with predicted metabolic activity; these proteins could be mapped to several P. gingivalis metabolic pathways where enzymes catalysing sequential reactions within the same pathway were often found acetylated. In particular, the catabolic pathways of complex anaerobic fermentation of amino acids to produce energy had 12 enzymes lysine acetylated. The results suggest that lysine acetylation may be an important mechanism in metabolic regulation in P. gingivalis, which is vital for P. gingivalis survival and adaptation of its metabolism throughout infection. Statement of significance. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in the development of chronic periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of the teeth. The ability of the pathogen to induce dysbiosis and disease is related to an array of specific virulence factors and metabolic regulation that enables the bacterium to proliferate in an inflamed periodontal pocket. The mechanisms P. gingivalis uses to adapt to a changing and hostile environment are poorly understood and here we show, for the first time, that enzymes of critical metabolic pathways for energy production in this bacterium were acetylated on certain lysine residues. These enzymes were often found catalysing sequential reactions within the same catabolic pathway. The results suggest that lysine acetylation is an important mechanism of metabolic regulation in P. gingivalis vital for its adaptation and proliferation to produce disease. "

To remove ROS, cells have developed ROS-specific defense mechanisms, including the enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide anions into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Although hydrogen peroxide is less reactive than superoxide, it is still capable of oxidizing, unfolding, and inactivating SOD1, at least in vitro. To explore the relevance of post-translational modification (PTM) of SOD1, including peroxide-related modifications, SOD1 was purified from postmortem human nervous tissue. As much as half of all purified SOD1 protein contained non-native post-translational modifications (PTMs), the most prevalent modifications being cysteinylation and peroxide-related oxidations. Many PTMs targeted a single reactive SOD1 cysteine, Cys111. An intriguing observation was that unlike native SOD1, cysteinylated SOD1 was not oxidized. To further characterize how cysteinylation may protect SOD1 from oxidation, cysteine-modified SOD1 was prepared in vitro and exposed to peroxide. Cysteinylation conferred nearly complete protection from peroxide-induced oxidation of SOD1. Moreover, SOD1 that has been cysteinylated and peroxide oxidized in vitro comprised a set of PTMs that bear a striking resemblance to the myriad of PTMs observed in SOD1 purified from human tissue. "

NukM, the modifying enzyme of nukacin ISK-1, which is produced by Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1, catalyzes the dehydration of specific Ser/Thr residues in a precursor peptide, followed by conjugative addition of intramolecular Cys to dehydrated residues to generate a cyclic structure. By contrast, the precursor peptide of nisin is modified by 2 enzymes, NisB and NisC, which mediate dehydration and cyclization, respectively. While the C-terminal domain of NukM is homologous to NisC, the N-terminal domain has no homology with other known proteins. We expressed and characterized the N- and C-terminal domains of NukM, NukMN, and NukMC, separately. In vitro reconstitution revealed that full-length NukM fully modified the substrate peptide NukA. NukMN partially phosphorylated, dehydrated, and cyclized NukA. By contrast, NukMC did not catalyze dehydration, phosphorylation, or cyclization reactions. Interaction studies using surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that NukM and NukMN can bind NukA with high affinity, whereas NukMC has low substrate-recognition activity. These results suggest that NukMN is mainly responsible for substrate recognition and dehydration and that the whole NukM structure, including the C-terminal domain, is required for the complete modification of NukA.

Distinct mod-form distributions may summarize information about distinct cellular and physiological conditions and allow downstream processes to interpret this information accordingly. Such information 'encoding' by PTMs may facilitate evolution by weakening the need to directly link upstream conditions to downstream responses.

The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia.

Here, we describe several PTMOracle protocols investigating complex PTM-associated relationships and their role in PPIs. This is assisted by OraclePainter for coloring proteins by the modifications present and visualizing these in the context of networks, by OracleTools for cross-matching PTMs with sequence feature for all nodes in the network, and by OracleResults for exploring specific proteins and visualizing their PTMs in the context of protein sequences. This unit aims to demonstrate how PTMOracle can be used to systematically explore network visualizations and generate testable hypotheses regarding the functional role of PTMs in PPIs, and how the results can be analyzed to better understand the regulatory role of PTMs in PPIs. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Their N-terminal tails are enriched in combinatorial post-translational modifications (PTMs), which influence gene regulation, DNA repair, and chromosome condensation. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based middle-down proteomics has emerged as a technique to analyze co-occurring PTMs, as it allows for the characterization of intact histone tails (>50 aa) rather than short (<20 aa) peptides analyzed by bottom-up. However, a demonstration of its reliability is still lacking. We compared results obtained with the middle-down and the bottom-up strategy in calculating PTM relative abundance and stoichiometry. Since bottom-up was proven to have biases in peptide signal detection such as uneven ionization efficiency, we performed an external correction using a synthetic peptide library with known peptide relative abundance. Corrected bottom-up data were used as reference. Calculated abundances of single PTMs showed similar deviations from the reference when comparing middle-down and uncorrected bottom-up results. Moreover, we show that the two strategies provided similar performance in defining accurate PTM stoichiometry. Collectively, we evidenced that the middle-down strategy is at least equally reliable to bottom-up in quantifying histone PTMs. "

Studies using animal models have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF; however, differences in cardiac physiology and the manifestation of HF between animals, particularly rodents, and humans necessitates the direct interrogation of human heart tissue samples. Nevertheless, an ever-present concern when examining human heart tissue samples is the potential for artefactual changes related to temperature changes during tissue shipment or sample processing. Herein, we examined the effects of temperature on the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of sarcomeric proteins, the proteins responsible for muscle contraction, under conditions mimicking those that might occur during tissue shipment or sample processing. Using a powerful top-down proteomics method, we found that sarcomeric protein PTMs were differentially affected by temperature. Specifically, cardiac troponin I and enigma homolog isoform 2 showed robust increases in phosphorylation when tissue was incubated at either 4 °C or 22 °C. The observed increase is likely due to increased cyclic AMP levels and activation of protein kinase A in the tissue. On the contrary, cardiac troponin T and myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation decreased when tissue was incubated at 4 °C or 22 °C. Furthermore, significant protein degradation was also observed after incubation at 4 °C or 22 °C. Overall, these results indicate that temperature exerts various effects on sarcomeric protein PTMs and careful tissue handling is critical for studies involving human heart samples. Moreover, these findings highlight the power of top-down proteomics for examining the integrity of cardiac tissue samples."

Lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. In this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from Thermus thermophilus HB8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. Functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. The propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. Furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. In addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase-specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase-specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. Moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. Finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as Schiff-base formation and ligand binding. "

CFTR endocytic recycling is known to be regulated by its interaction with PDZ domain containing proteins. Recent work has shown that the PDZ domain scaffolding protein NHERF1 finely regulates both wt and F508delCFTR membrane recycling. Here, we investigated the effect of P. aeruginosa infection on NHERF1 post-translational modifications and how this affects CFTR expression in bronchial epithelial cells and in murine lung. Both in vitro in bronchial cells, and in vivo in mice, infection reduced CFTR expression and increased NHERF1 molecular weight through its hyper-phosphorylation and ubquitination as a consequence of both bacterial pilin- and flagellin-mediated host-cell interaction. The ability of P. aeruginosa to down-regulate mature CFTR expression was reduced both in vivo in NHERF1 knockout mice and in vitro after silencing NHERF1 expression or mutations blocking its phosphorylation at serines 279 and 301. These studies provide the first evidence that NHERF1 phosphorylation may negatively regulate its action and, therefore, the assembly and function of multiprotein NHERF1 complexes in response to infection. The identification of molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects could identify novel targets to block potential P. aeruginosa interference with the efficacy of potentiator and/or corrector compounds."

Their phenolic metabolites are converted intracellularly to electrophilic quinone imines upon autoxidation and can embed in the cellular matrix through a transimination reaction that leaves a redox-active residue as a substituent of lysine side-chain amino groups. To demonstrate the occurrence of this process within the cellular nucleus, Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells were treated with the para-phenol of 3,5-dimethylamine, after which the histone proteins were isolated, derivatized, and subjected to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to determine which lysines were modified. Nine residues in histones H2A, H2B, and H4 were identified; these were located in histone tails, close to where DNA makes contact with the nuclear core particle, elsewhere on the protein surface, and deep within the core. Kinetics of disappearance of the modified lysines in cultured cells was determined using isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. AA8 cells were also transfected with the genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide biosensor HyPer in constructs that lead to expression of HyPer in different cellular compartments. Challenging the resulting cells with the dimethylaminophenol resulted in sustained fluorescence emission in each of the compartments, demonstrating ongoing production of H2O2. The kinetics of modified lysine loss determined by mass spectrometry was consistent with persistence of HyPer fluorescence emission. We conclude that the para-phenol of 3,5-dimethylamine can become stably integrated into the histone proteins, which are minimally repaired, if at all, and function as a persistent source of intracellular H2O2."

Some modified peptides were identified, with a mass shift corresponding to the addition of a CH₂O group (+30.0106 u). We present evidence that this shift corresponds to a hyxdroxymethylation of asparagine and glutamine residues. This known but poorly documented post-translational modification was only found in a few proteins of S. aureus grown under specific conditions. This specificity seemed to exclude the hypothesis of an artifact due to sample preparation. Altogether hydroxymethylation was observed in 35 peptides from 15 proteins in our dataset, which corresponded to 41 modified sites, 35 of them being univocally localized. While no function can currently be assigned to this post-translational modification, we hypothesize that it could be linked to modulation of virulence factors, since it was mostly found on some surface proteins of S. aureus."

To facilitate the elucidation of the structural aspects of these PTM events, we mapped the PTM sites on the known tertiary structures for the respective proteins and their homologs. Wu et al.

Therefore, we assessed the structural characteristics of these phosphorylation and acetylation sites on the tertiary structures of the identified proteins or their homologs. Our study revealed that many of the identified phosphosites are in close proximity to bound ligands, i.e., the numbers of 'nearby' and 'peripheral' phosphorylation sites represent 56 % (48/86 sites) of total identified phosphorylation sites. In addition, approximately 60 % of all phosphosites exhibited <10 % accessible surface area of their side chains, suggesting some structural rearrangement is required for phosphoryl transfer by kinases. Our findings also indicate that phosphorylation of a residue occurs more frequently at a flexible region of the protein, whereas lysine acetylation occurs more frequently in an ordered structure."

We exploited this system to examine select post-translational modifications (PTMs) present on a transcriptionally inert population of endogenous human p53, as well as on p53 activated in response to etoposide treatment of normal human fibroblasts. These forms of p53 were purified from whole cell lysates by means of immunoaffinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE, and peptides derived from them were subjected to nano-ultra-high-performance LC-MS and MS/MS analyses on a high-resolution accurate-mass MS platform (data available via ProteomeXchange, PXD000464). We identified an unexpectedly large number of PTMs, comprising phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues, methylation of Arg residues, and acetylation, ubiquitinylation, and methylation of Lys residues-for example, some 150 previously undescribed modifications of p53 isolated from infected cells. These modifications were distributed across all functional domains of both forms of the endogenous human p53 protein, as well as those of an orthologous population of p53 isolated from COS-1 cells. Despite the differences in activity, including greater in vitro sequence-specific DNA binding activity exhibited by p53 isolated from etoposide-treated cells, few differences were observed in the location, nature, or relative frequencies of PTMs on the two populations of human p53. Indeed, the wealth of PTMs that we have identified is consistent with a far greater degree of complex, combinatorial regulation of p53 by PTM than previously anticipated. "

This modification has been detected under a wide range of pathological conditions and has been shown to alter protein function. Whether 3-nitrotyrosine is important in normal cellular processes or is likely to affect specific biological pathways remains unclear. Using GPS-YNO2, a recently described 3-nitrotyrosine prediction algorithm, a set of predictions for nitrated residues in the human proteome was generated. In total, 9.27 per cent of the proteome was predicted to be nitratable (27 922/301 091). By matching the predictions against a set of curated and experimentally validated 3-nitrotyrosine sites in human proteins, it was found that GPS-YNO2 is able to predict 73.1 per cent (404/553) of these sites. Furthermore, of these sites, 42 have been shown to be nitrated endogenously, with 85.7 per cent (36/42) of these predicted to be nitrated. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the predicted dataset for a whole proteome analysis. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was subsequently performed on predicted and all experimentally validated nitrated tyrosine. This found mild but specific biophysical constraints that affect the susceptibility of tyrosine to nitration, and these may play a role in increasing the likelihood of 3-nitrotyrosine to affect processes, including phosphorylation and DNA binding. Furthermore, examining the evolutionary conservation of predicted 3-nitrotyrosine showed that, relative to non-nitrated tyrosine residues, 3-nitrotyrosine residues are generally less conserved. This suggests that, at least in the majority of cases, 3-nitrotyrosine is likely to have a deleterious effect on protein function and less likely to be important in normal cellular function."

The O-glycosylation of T. cruzi mucins (Tc-mucins) is initiated by enzymatic addition of α-O-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to threonine (Thr) by the UDP-GlcNAc:polypeptide α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (pp-α-GlcNAcT) in the Golgi. The Tc-mucin is characterized by the presence of a high structural diversity of O-linked oligosaccharides found among different parasite strains, comprising two O-glycan Cores. In the Core 1, from strains principally associated with the domestic transmission cycle of Chagas disease, the GlcNAc O-4 is substituted with a β-galactopyranose (βGalp) unit, and in the most complex oligosaccharides the GlcNAc O-6 is further processed by the addition of β1 → 2-linked Galp residues creating a short linear Galp-containing chain. In the Core 2 structures, expressed by strains isolated from T. cruzi sylvatic hosts, the GlcNAc O-4 carries a β-galactofuranose (βGalf) unit and the GlcNAc O-6 can carry a branched Galpβ1 → 3[Galpβ1 → 2]Galpβ1 → 6 motif. The O-glycans carrying nonreducing terminal βGalp are available for sialylation by a surface T. cruzi trans-sialidase activity. Based on structural results, this review summarizes available data on the highly conserved process, which adds the GlcNAc unit in α-linkage to Thr residues the basis of the post-translational modification system in T. cruzi mucins. In addition, a mechanism unique employed by the parasite to transfer exogenous sialic acid residues to Tc-mucins is presented. "

Transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated at the post-translational level by various enzymes including kinases, acetyl transferases, deacetylases, ubiquitin E3 ligases, and prolyl isomerases. We describe a sequential and linear causality between post-translational modifications of RUNX2 by these enzymes. RUNX2 is one of the most important osteogenic transcription factors; however, it is not a suitable drug target.

In the present study, 303 LRR-RLKs were identified in the genome of B. rapa and comparative phylogenetic analysis of 1213 combined LRR-RLKs of B. rapa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa helped us to categorize the gene family into 15 subfamilies based on their sequence and structural similarities. The chromosome localizations of 293 genes allowed the prediction of duplicates, and motif conservation and intron/exon patterns showed differences among the B. rapa LRR-RLK (BrLRR-RLK) genes. Additionally, computational function annotation and expression analysis was used to predict their possible functional roles in the plant system. Biochemical results for 11 selected genes showed variations in phosphorylation activity. Interestingly, BrBAK1 showed strong auto-phosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation on its tyrosine and threonine residues compared with AtBAK1 in previous studies. The AtBAK1 receptor kinase is involved in plant growth and development, plant innate immunity, and programmed cell death, and our results suggest that BrBAK1 might also be involved in the same functions. Another interesting result was that BrBAK1, BrBRI1, BrPEPR1 and BrPEPR2 showed activity with both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, indicating that they might have dual-specificity kinase activity. This study provides comprehensive results for the BrLRR-RLKs, revealing expansion of the gene family through gene duplications, structural similarities and variations among the genes, and potential functional roles according to gene ontology, transcriptome profiling and biochemical analysis."

PTMs have been shown to affect almost every aspect of protein activity, including function, localisation, stability, and dynamic interactions with other molecules. Although many PTMs are evolutionarily conserved there are also important kingdom-specific modifications which should be considered when expressing recombinant proteins. Plants are gaining increasing acceptance as an expression system for recombinant proteins, particularly where eukaryotic-like PTMs are required. Glycosylation is the most extensively studied PTM of plant-made recombinant proteins. However, other types of protein processing and modification also occur which are important for the production of high quality recombinant protein, such as hydroxylation and lipidation. Plant and/or protein engineering approaches offer many opportunities to exploit PTM pathways allowing the molecular farmer to produce a humanised product with modifications functionally similar or identical to the native protein. Indeed, plants have demonstrated a high degree of tolerance to changes in PTM pathways allowing recombinant proteins to be modified in a specific and controlled manner, frequently resulting in a homogeneity of product which is currently unrivalled by alternative expression platforms. Whether a recombinant protein is intended for use as a scientific reagent, a cosmetic additive or as a pharmaceutical, PTMs through their presence and complexity, offer an extensive range of options for the rational design of humanised (biosimilar), enhanced (biobetter) or novel products."

Accelerated Def(+/+) mice developed α-defensin·LDL complexes that accelerate the clearance of LDL from the circulation accompanied by enhanced vascular deposition and retention of LDL, induction of endothelial cathepsins, increased endothelial permeability to LDL, and the development of lipid streaks in the aortic roots when fed a regular diet and at normal plasma levels of LDL.

In specialized metabolism, the active sites of terpene synthases (TPSs) evolve in shape and reactivity to direct the biosynthesis of a myriad of chemotypes for organismal fitness. As most terpene biosynthesis mechanistically involves highly reactive carbocationic intermediates, the protein surfaces catalyzing these cascade reactions possess reactive regions possibly prone to premature carbocation capture and potentially enzyme inactivation. Here, we show using proteomic and X-ray crystallographic analyses that cationic intermediates undergo capture by conserved active site residues leading to inhibitory self-alkylation. Moreover, the level of cation-mediated inactivation increases with mutation of the active site, upon changes in the size and structure of isoprenoid diphosphate substrates, and alongside increases in reaction temperatures.

For example, angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved during the Cretaceous period more than 100 mya and quickly colonized terrestrial habitats [1]. A major reason for their astonishing success was the formation of fruits, which exist in a myriad of different shapes and sizes [2]. Evolution of organ shape is fueled by variation in expression patterns of regulatory genes causing changes in anisotropic cell expansion and division patterns [3-5]. However, the molecular mechanisms that alter the polarity of growth to generate novel shapes are largely unknown. The heart-shaped fruits produced by members of the Capsella genus comprise an anatomical novelty, making it particularly well suited for studies on morphological diversification [6-8]. Here, we show that post-translational modification of regulatory proteins provides a critical step in organ-shape formation. Our data reveal that the SUMO protease, HEARTBREAK (HTB), from Capsella rubella controls the activity of the key regulator of fruit development, INDEHISCENT (CrIND in C. rubella), via de-SUMOylation. This post-translational modification initiates a transduction pathway required to ensure precisely localized auxin biosynthesis, thereby facilitating anisotropic cell expansion to ultimately form the heart-shaped Capsella fruit. Therefore, although variation in the expression of key regulatory genes is known to be a primary driver in morphological evolution, our work demonstrates how other processes-such as post-translational modification of one such regulator-affects organ morphology."

Polyglutamylation has long been known as the functionally important post-translational modification of tubulins, which carry poly(L-glutamic acid) chains of heterogeneous length branching off from the main chain at the gamma-carboxy groups of a few specific glutamate residues. In Artemia PSP, however, Edman degradation of enzymatic peptides revealed that at least 13, and presumably 16, glutamate residues were modified by the attachment of a single L-glutamate, representing a hitherto undescribed type of post-translational modification: namely, multiple gamma-glutamylation or the addition of a large number of glutamate residues along the polypeptide chain. Although biological significance of PSP and its modification is yet to be established, suppression of in vitro thermal aggregation of lactate dehydrogenase by glutamylated PSP was observed."

A single molecule can exhibit a ""modform"" or combinatorial pattern of co-occurring PTMs across multiple sites, and a molecular population can exhibit a distribution of amounts of different modforms. How can this ""modform distribution"" be estimated by mass spectrometry (MS)? Bottom-up MS, based on cleavage into peptides, destroys correlations between PTMs on different peptides, but it is conceivable that multiple proteases with appropriate patterns of cleavage could reconstruct the modform distribution. We introduce a mathematical language for describing MS measurements and show, on the contrary, that no matter how many distinct proteases are available, the shortfall in information required for reconstruction worsens exponentially with increasing numbers of sites. Whereas top-down MS on intact proteins can do better, current technology cannot prevent the exponential worsening. However, our analysis also shows that all forms of MS yield linear equations for modform amounts. This permits different MS protocols to be integrated and the modform distribution to be constrained within a high-dimensional ""modform region"", which may offer a feasible proxy for analyzing information encoding."

Recently, many online tools are developed to prediction various types of PTM sites, most of which are based on local sequence and some biological information. However, few of existing tools consider the relations between different PTMs for their prediction task. Here, we develop a web server called PTM-ssMP to predict PTM site, which adopts site-specific modification profile (ssMP) to efficiently extract and encode the information of both proximal PTMs and local sequence simultaneously. In PTM-ssMP we provide efficient prediction of multiple types of PTM site including phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, methylation, O-GalNAc, O-GlcNAc, sulfation and proteolytic cleavage. To assess the performance of PTM-ssMP, a large number of experimentally verified PTM sites are collected from several sources and used to train and test the prediction models. Our results suggest that ssMP consistently contributes to remarkable improvement of prediction performance. In addition, results of independent tests demonstrate that PTM-ssMP compares favorably with other existing tools for different PTM types.

In heart and muscle, CD36 is the main (long-chain) fatty acid transporter, regulating myocellular fatty acid uptake via its vesicle-mediated reversible trafficking (recycling) between intracellular membrane compartments and the cell surface. CD36 is subject to various types of post-translational modification. This review focusses on the role of these modifications in further regulation of myocellular fatty acid uptake. Glycosylation, ubiquitination and palmitoylation are involved in regulating CD36 stability, while phosphorylation at extracellular sites affect the rate of fatty acid uptake. In addition, CD36 modification by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine may regulate the translocation of CD36 from endosomes to the cell surface. Acetylation of CD36 has also been reported, but possible effects on CD36 expression and/or functioning have not yet been addressed. Taken together, CD36 is subject to a multitude of post-translational modifications of which their functional implications are beginning to be understood.

CyPB is proposed to be the major PPIase catalyzing the rate-limiting step in collagen folding. Mutations in PPIB cause recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta type IX, a moderately severe to lethal bone dysplasia. To investigate the role of CyPB in collagen folding and post-translational modifications, we generated Ppib-/- mice that recapitulate the OI phenotype. Knock-out (KO) mice are small, with reduced femoral areal bone mineral density (aBMD), bone volume per total volume (BV/TV) and mechanical properties, as well as increased femoral brittleness. Ppib transcripts are absent in skin, fibroblasts, femora and calvarial osteoblasts, and CyPB is absent from KO osteoblasts and fibroblasts on western blots. Only residual (2-11%) collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation is detectable in KO cells and tissues. Collagen folds more slowly in the absence of CyPB, supporting its rate-limiting role in folding. However, treatment of KO cells with cyclosporine A causes further delay in folding, indicating the potential existence of another collagen PPIase. We confirmed and extended the reported role of CyPB in supporting collagen lysyl hydroxylase (LH1) activity. Ppib-/- fibroblast and osteoblast collagen has normal total lysyl hydroxylation, while increased collagen diglycosylation is observed. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of bone and osteoblast type I collagen revealed site-specific alterations of helical lysine hydroxylation, in particular, significantly reduced hydroxylation of helical crosslinking residue K87. Consequently, underhydroxylated forms of di- and trivalent crosslinks are strikingly increased in KO bone, leading to increased total crosslinks and decreased helical hydroxylysine- to lysine-derived crosslink ratios. The altered crosslink pattern was associated with decreased collagen deposition into matrix in culture, altered fibril structure in tissue, and reduced bone strength. These studies demonstrate novel consequences of the indirect regulatory effect of CyPB on collagen hydroxylation, impacting collagen glycosylation, crosslinking and fibrillogenesis, which contribute to maintaining bone mechanical properties.

There is no cure and current treatments fail to slow the progression of the disease. As such, new treatment options are desperately needed. Epigenetic targets are an attractive possibility because they are reversible. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression unrelated to changes in DNA sequence. Three main epigenetic mechanisms include the methylation of DNA, microRNAs and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Histone modifications occur in many amino acid residues and include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation as well as other chemical moieties. Recent evidence points to a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of ALS. Here, we review recent advances linking ALS and epigenetics, with a strong focus on histone modifications.

The opposite of coagulation is fibrinolysis. The proper functioning of both systems allow to maintain a hemostasis. Increasing level of fibrinogen is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Reactive oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine species are created in inflammatory conditions, ischemia and tissues reperfusion. They can modify the fibrinogen molecule. The most important changes are associated with nitration and chlorination of tyrosine residues, oxidation of methionine, histidine and tryptophan residues, as well as formation dityrosine and carbonyl groups. Moreover, structure of fibrinogen is modified by glycation and homocysteinylation in hyperglycemia and hyperhomocysteinemia conditions. Non-enzymatic posttranslational modifications of fibrinogen contribute to formation of thrombogenic fibrin structure. The degree of fibrinogen modification is responsible for fiber structure, packing and susceptibility of fibrin clots to fibrinolysis. Additionally, the viscoelastic properties are changed. Resistance to fibrinolysis is largely associated with the modification of lysine residues in the protein molecule. Each of these alternations may contribute to increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. "

Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) is a ubiquitous multifunctional sterol C27-hydroxylase that eliminates cholesterol and likely 7-ketocholesterol from the retina and many other tissues. We investigated the post-translational modification of this protein with isolevuglandins, arachidonate oxidation products. Treatment of purified recombinant CYP27A1 with authentic iso[4]levuglandin E(2) (iso[4]LGE(2)) in vitro diminished enzyme activity in a time- and phospholipid-dependent manner. A multiple reaction monitoring protocol was then developed to identify the sites and extent of iso[4]LGE(2) adduction. CYP27A1 exhibited only three Lys residues, Lys(134), Lys(358), and Lys(476), that readily interact with iso[4]LGE(2) in vitro. Such selective modification enabled the generation of an internal standard, (15)N-labeled CYP27A1 modified with iso[4]LGE(2), for the subsequent analysis of a human retinal sample. Two multiple reaction monitoring transitions arising from the peptide AVLK(358)(-C(20)H(26)O(3))ETLR in the retinal sample were observed that co-eluted with the corresponding two (15)N transitions from the supplemented standard. These data demonstrate that modified CYP27A1 is present in the retina. We suggest that such protein modification impairs sterol elimination and likely has other pathological sequelae. We also propose that the post-translational modifications identified in CYP27A1 exemplify a general mechanism whereby oxidative stress and inflammation deleteriously affect protein function, contributing, for example, to cholesterol-rich lesions associated with age-related macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease. The proteomic protocols developed in this study are generally applicable to characterization of lipid-derived oxidative protein modifications occurring in vivo, including proteins bound to membranes."

We undertook a comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple polluted and environmentally preserved Phleum pratense (Timothy grass) pollen samples using scanning electron microscopy, in-depth PTM profiling, determination of organic and inorganic pollutants, analysis of the release of sub-pollen particles and phenols/proteins, and analysis of proteome expression using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, we used quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunoblotting. An increased phenolic content and release of sub-pollen particles was found in pollen samples from the polluted area, including a significantly higher content of mercury, cadmium, and manganese, with irregular long spines on pollen grain surface structures. Antioxidative defense-related enzymes were significantly upregulated and seven oxidative PTMs were significantly increased (methionine, histidine, lysine, and proline oxidation; tyrosine glycosylation, lysine 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal adduct, and lysine carbamylation) in pollen exposed to the chemical plant and road traffic pollution sources. Oxidative modifications affected several Timothy pollen allergens; Phl p 6, in particular, exhibited several different oxidative modifications.

In particular, we study the loss of modification target sites as a consequence of disease mutation. We find that about 5% of disease-associated mutations may affect known modification sites, either partially (4%) of fully (1%), compared to about 2% of putatively neutral polymorphisms. Most of the fifteen post-translational modification types analyzed were found to be disrupted at levels higher than expected by chance. Molecular functions and physiochemical properties at sites of disease mutation were also compared to those of neutral polymorphisms involved in the process of post-translational modification site disruption. Disease-associated mutations in the neighborhood of post-translationally modified sites were found to be enriched in mutations that change polarity, charge, and hydrophobicity of the wild-type amino acids. Overall, these results further suggest that disruption of modification sites is an important but not the major cause of human genetic disease."

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was applied to compare the structure and backbone dynamics of six GlbN forms differing in their oxidation state [Fe(II) or Fe(III)], distal ligand to the iron (histidine, carbon monoxide, or cyanide), or heme post-translational modification (b heme or covalently attached heme). Structural properties were assessed with pseudocontact shift calculations. (15)N relaxation data were analyzed by reduced spectral density mapping (picosecond to nanosecond motions) and by inspection of elevated R(2) values (microsecond to millisecond motions). On the picosecond to nanosecond time scale, GlbN exhibited little flexibility and was unresponsive to the differences among the various forms. Regions of slightly higher mobility were the CE turn, the EF loop, and the H-H' kink. In contrast, fluctuations on the microsecond to millisecond time scale depended on the form. Cyanide binding to the ferric state did not enhance motions, whereas reduction to the ferrous bis-histidine state resulted in elevated R(2) values for several amides. This response was attributed, at least in part, to a weakening of the distal histidine coordination. Carbon monoxide binding quenched some of these fluctuations. The results emphasized the role of the distal ligand in dictating backbone flexibility and illustrated the multiple ways in which motions are controlled by the hemoglobin fold."

Although much is known about the biology of this enzyme under aerobic conditions, less is understood regarding the effects of low oxygen levels on Cu/Zn SOD enzymes from diverse organisms. We show here that like bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), adaptation of the multicellular Caenorhabditis elegans to growth at low oxygen levels involves strong downregulation of its Cu/Zn SOD. Much of this regulation occurs at the post-translational level where CCS-independent activation of Cu/Zn SOD is inhibited. Hypoxia inactivates the endogenous Cu/Zn SOD of C. elegans Cu/Zn SOD as well as a P144 mutant of S. cerevisiae Cu/Zn SOD (herein denoted Sod1p) that is independent of CCS. In our studies of S. cerevisiae Sod1p, we noted a post-translational modification to the inactive enzyme during hypoxia. Analysis of this modification by mass spectrometry revealed phosphorylation at serine 38. Serine 38 represents a putative proline-directed kinase target site located on a solvent-exposed loop that is positioned at one end of the Sod1p β-barrel, a region immediately adjacent to residues previously shown to influence CCS-dependent activation. Although phosphorylation of serine 38 is minimal when the Sod1p is abundantly active (e.g., high oxygen level), up to 50% of Sod1p can be phosphorylated when CCS activation of the enzyme is blocked, e.g., by hypoxia or low-copper conditions. Serine 38 phosphorylation can be a marker for inactive pools of Sod1p."

The cytosolic Aco in its reduced form operates as an enzyme, whereas in the oxidized form it is involved in the control of iron homeostasis as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in regulation of Aco functions.

Our approach reveals that modification of distinct amino acids by precise genome engineering can help to clarify the functions of post-translational modifications on proteins encoded by essential gene in an endogenous context."

In addition, they play a role in angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, organogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the chemokine/chemokine receptor network is highly complex and needs to be tightly controlled. An important mechanism of fine-tuning chemokine activity and reducing its apparent redundancy is post-translational modification (PTM) of chemokines and their receptors. Under inflammatory conditions, enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), plasmin, CD13, CD26, and peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) and protein-modifying agents, such as peroxynitrite, are upregulated and released and may provoke truncation, degradation, nitration or citrullination of chemokines. Most modified chemokines show altered biological activity. This review reports how PTMs influence the biological functions of chemokines, with special attention for the impact beyond chemotaxis."

There are several lines of evidence indicating that proteasomes exist in heterogeneous subpopulations in cardiac muscle, differentiated, in part, by post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs regulate numerous facets of proteasome function, including catalytic activities, complex assembly, interactions with associating partners, subcellular localization, substrate preference, and complex turnover. Classical technologies used to identify PTMs on proteasomes have lacked the ability to determine site specificity, quantify stoichiometry, and perform large-scale, multi-PTM analysis. Recent advancements in proteomic technologies have largely overcome these limitations. We present here a discussion on the importance of PTMs in modulating proteasome function in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology, followed by the presentation of a state-of-the-art proteomic workflow for identifying and quantifying PTMs of cardiac proteasomes."

While in vitro or in vivo eNOS S-glutathionylation with modification of Cys689 and Cys908 of its reductase domain is triggered by high levels of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) or oxidative thiyl radical formation, it remains unclear how this process may be reversed. Glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1), a cytosolic and glutathione-dependent enzyme, can reverse protein S-glutathionylation; however, its role in regulating eNOS S-glutathionylation remains unknown. We demonstrate that Grx1 in the presence of glutathione (GSH) (1 mM) reverses GSSG-mediated eNOS S-glutathionylation with restoration of NO synthase activity. Because Grx1 also catalyzes protein S-glutathionylation with an increased [GSSG]/[GSH] ratio, we measured its effect on eNOS S-glutathionylation when the [GSSG]/[GSH] ratio was >0.2, which can occur in cells and tissues under oxidative stress, and observed an increased level of eNOS S-glutathionylation with a marked decrease in eNOS activity without uncoupling. This eNOS S-glutathionylation was reversed with a decrease in the [GSSG]/[GSH] ratio to <0.1. Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified a new site of eNOS S-glutathionylation by Grx1 at Cys382, on the surface of the oxygenase domain, without modification of Cys689 or Cys908, each of which is buried within the reductase. Furthermore, Grx1 was demonstrated to be a protein partner of eNOS in vitro and in normal endothelial cells, supporting its role in eNOS redox regulation. In endothelial cells, Grx1 inhibition or gene silencing increased the level of eNOS S-glutathionylation and decreased the level of cellular NO generation. Thus, Grx1 can exert an important role in the redox regulation of eNOS in cells."

This modification was originally noted in protein degradation during neurodegenerative processes, with an apparently different physiological relevance between central and peripheral nervous system. Subsequent studies have identified a steadily increasing number of proteins and proteolysis-derived polypeptides as arginyltransferase (ATE1) substrates, including β-amyloid, α-synuclein, and TDP43 proteolytic fragments. Arginylation is involved in signaling processes of proteins and polypeptides that are further ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. In addition, it is also implicated in autophagy/lysosomal degradation pathway. Recent studies using mutant mouse strains deficient in ATE1 indicate additional roles of this modification in neuronal physiology. As ATE1 is capable of modifying proteins either at the N-terminus or middle-chain acidic residues, determining which proteins function are modulated by arginylation represents a big challenge. Here, we review studies addressing various roles of ATE1 activity in nervous system function, and suggest future research directions that will clarify the role of post-translational protein arginylation in brain development and various neurological disorders. Arginyltransferase (ATE1), the enzyme responsible for post-translational arginylation, modulates the functions of a wide variety of proteins and polypeptides, and is also involved in the main degradation pathways of intracellular proteins. Regulatory roles of ATE1 have been well defined for certain organs.

In addition to their regulation by transcriptional mechanisms, understanding the range of PTMs (post-translational modifications) of INGs is important in understanding how ING functions are fine-tuned in the physiological setting and how they add to the repertoire of activities affected by the INGs. In the present paper we review the different PTMs that have been reported to occur on INGs. We discuss the PTMs that modulate ING function under normal conditions and in response to a variety of stresses. We also describe the ING PTMs that have been identified by several unbiased MS-based PTM enrichment techniques and subsequent proteomic analysis. Among the ING PTMs identified to date, a subset has been characterized for their biological significance and have been shown to affect processes including subcellular localization, interaction with enzymatic complexes and ING protein half-life.

The study includes mode of action of granzyme M using cationic binding sites, substrate specificity, post-translational structural modification and its functional relationship and interaction of the enzyme with inhibitor in an attempt to explore how the activity of human granzyme M is controlled under physiological conditions. It is concluded from the present study that the post-translational modification, including Oglycosylation of serine, phosphorylation of serine and threonine and myristoylation of glycine, play an important role in the interaction of enzyme with the cell surface membrane and regulate protein trafficking and stability. Phosphorylated serine and threonine also plays a role in tumor elimination, viral clearance and tissue repair. In Gzm M there are cationic sites, cs1 and cs2 that may participate in binding of Gzm M to the cell surface, thereby promoting its uptake and eventual release into the cytoplasm. Gzm M shows apoptotic activity both by caspase dependent and independent pathways. Modeling of inhibitors bound to the granzyme active site shows that the dimer also contributes to substrate specificity in a unique manner by extending the active-site cleft."

We previously demonstrated that the lipid environment is also a determinant of initial protein topology, which is dynamically responsive to post-assembly changes in membrane lipid composition. However, the effect on protein topology of post-assembly phosphorylation of amino acids localized within initially cytoplasmically oriented extramembrane domains has never been investigated. Here, we show in a controlled in vitro system that phosphorylation of a membrane protein can trigger a change in topological arrangement. The rate of change occurred on a scale of seconds, comparable with the rates observed upon changes in the protein lipid environment. The rate and extent of topological rearrangement were dependent on the charges of extramembrane domains and the lipid bilayer surface. Using model membranes mimicking the lipid compositions of eukaryotic organelles, we determined that anionic lipids, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and membrane fluidity play critical roles in these processes. Our results demonstrate how post-translational modifications may influence membrane protein topology in a lipid-dependent manner, both along the organelle trafficking pathway and at their final destination. The results provide further evidence that membrane protein topology is dynamic, integrating for the first time the effect of changes in lipid composition and regulators of cellular processes. The discovery of a new topology regulatory mechanism opens additional avenues for understanding unexplored structure-function relationships and the development of optimized topology prediction tools."

The prevalence is higher (about 30%) among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. APS is associated with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies directed against negatively charged molecules and a combination of protein-complexed phospholipids. The predominant protein antigen in this disorder is beta 2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). Despite the discovery of ""new"" antigenic targets and development of ""new"" methodological approaches, the laboratory diagnosis of APS is still an evolving field and studies to identify further antigenic target(s) as potential diagnostic markers and risk predictors are in progress. In particular, recent studies were aimed at analyzing the pathogenic role of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins induced by inflammation and/or oxidative stress as modulators of protein structure and function and possibly as a source of antigenic epitopes. The present review is focused on PTMs of self-proteins responsible for autoimmune reactions in patients with APS. At present, the known PTMs in APS involve β2GPI. In particular, the PTM of β2GPI via thiol-exchange reactions is a highly specific phenomenon that makes the protein more antigenic. Other PTMs, including sialylation and acetylation, may affect β2GPI antigenicity. Moreover, the addition or loss of carbohydrate chains affects β2GPI immunoreactivity since carbohydrates are determining factors for β2GPI conformation. In addition to β2GPI, PTMs of other self proteins such as vimentin and annexins may play a role in the immune response during APS. The study of PTMs is useful to clarify the role of modified proteins in the pathogenesis of APS as well as to design more efficient diagnostic/prognostic tools and more targeted therapeutic approaches."

However, it is unknown how vitamin D receptor regulates IkappaBalpha, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of vitamin D receptor deletion and IkappaBalpha expression. We found that cells lacking vitamin D receptor had significantly increased levels of IkappaBalpha mRNA and simultaneously decreased levels of IkappaBalpha protein. Lacking vitamin D receptor abolished its binding to the IkappaBalpha promoter. Moreover, the levels of protein translation regulators and the rate of protein synthesis were both decreased in cells lacking vitamin D receptor. At the post-translational level, IkappaBalpha ubiquitination was enhanced, indicating increased degradation of IkappaBalpha in the absence of vitamin D receptor. We further transfected cells with a plasmid carrying either wild-type or mutant IkappaBalpha. The expression of wild-type IkappaBalpha was much higher in the cells with vitamin D receptor than in the cells without vitamin D receptor, whereas the expression of exogenous IkappaBalpha was equally high in both cell lines. In summary, vitamin D receptor deletion affects IkappaBalpha through mRNA transcription, protein translation, protein-protein interaction, post-translational modification, and protein degradation, thus reducing the level of IkappaBalpha protein. Cells lacking vitamin D receptor are known in a proinflammatory state with activation of NF-kappaB.

We quantify changes in lysine and arginine PTMs on MBP derived from mice induced with an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The changes in PTMs are correlated to changes in neurological disability scoring (NDS), as a marker of myelin damage.

These findings suggest that the acetylation and methylation of lysine on MBP are PTMs associated with the neurological disability produced by EAE.

The cell surface of M. hyopneumoniae is extensively modified by processing events that target the P97 and P102 adhesin families. Here, we present analyses of the proteome of M. hyopneumoniae-type strain J using protein-centric approaches (one- and two-dimensional GeLC-MS/MS) that enabled us to focus on global processing events in this species. While these approaches only identified 52% of the predicted proteome (347 proteins), our analyses identified 35 surface-associated proteins with widely divergent functions that were targets of unusual endoproteolytic processing events, including cell adhesins, lipoproteins and proteins with canonical functions in the cytosol that moonlight on the cell surface. Affinity chromatography assays that separately used heparin, fibronectin, actin and host epithelial cell surface proteins as bait recovered cleavage products derived from these processed proteins, suggesting these fragments interact directly with the bait proteins and display previously unrecognized adhesive functions. We hypothesize that protein processing is underestimated as a post-translational modification in genome-reduced bacteria and prokaryotes more broadly, and represents an important mechanism for creating cell surface protein diversity.

Using mass spectrometry approaches, we show that histone H3.1, H3.3 and H4 of the honey bee are extensively modified by lysine acetylation and lysine methylation. We analysed histones isolated from queen ovaries and 96 hr-old larvae, in toto we quantified 23 specific modification states on 23 distinct peptides. In addition, we have identified and characterised patterns of histone PTMs that reside on the same peptide, generating detailed combinatorial information. Overall, we observed similar profiles of histone PTMs in both samples, with combinatorial patterns of lysine methylations on H3K27 and H3K36 more frequently identified in histones extracted from queen ovaries than from larvae. To our knowledge, this comprehensive dataset represents the first identification and quantitation of histone PTMs in this eusocial insect and emerging epigenetic model."

PTMOracle also allows extensive data to be integrated and coanalyzed with PPI networks, allowing the role of domains, motifs, and disordered regions to be considered. For proteins of interest, or a whole proteome, PTMOracle can generate network visualizations to reveal complex PTM-associated relationships. This is assisted by OraclePainter for coloring proteins by modifications, OracleTools for network analytics, and OracleResults for exploring tabulated findings. To illustrate the use of PTMOracle, we investigate PTM-associated relationships and their role in PPIs in four case studies. In the yeast interactome and its rich set of PTMs, we construct and explore histone-associated and domain-domain interaction networks and show how integrative approaches can predict kinases involved in phosphodegrons. In the human interactome, a phosphotyrosine-associated network is analyzed but highlights the sparse nature of human PPI networks and lack of PTM-associated data.

There are two classes of drug transporters- the solute carrier (SLC) transporters and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters -which predominantly differ in the energy source utilized to transport substrates across a membrane barrier. Despite their hydrophobic nature and residence in the membrane bilayer, drug transporters have dynamic structures and adopt many conformations during the translocation process. Whereas there is significant literature evidence for the substrate specificity and structure-function relationship for clinically relevant drug transporters proteins, there is less of an understanding in the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the functional expression of these proteins. Post-translational modifications have been shown to modulate drug transporter functional expression via a wide range of molecular mechanisms. These modifications commonly occur through the addition of a functional group (e.g. phosphorylation), a small protein (e.g. ubiquitination), sugar chains (e.g. glycosylation), or lipids (e.g. palmitoylation) on solvent accessible amino acid residues. These covalent additions often occur as a result of a signaling cascade and may be reversible depending on the type of modification and the intended fate of the signaling event. Here, we review the significant role in which post-translational modifications contribute to the dynamic regulation and functional consequences of SLC and ABC drug transporters and highlight recent progress in understanding their roles in transporter structure, function, and regulation."

The AQUA (for 'absolute quantification') method allows sensitive and specific targeted quantification of protein and post-translational modifications in complex protein mixtures using stable isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards. Each AQUA experiment is composed of two stages: method development and application to a biological scenario. In the method development stage, peptides from the protein of interest are chosen and then synthesized with stable isotopes such as (13)C, (2)H or (15)N. The abundance of these internal standards and their endogenous counterparts can be measured by mass spectrometry with selected reaction monitoring or selected ion monitoring methods.

The structural effects of both post-translational modifications on serine and threonine were examined within Baldwin model α-helical peptides (Ac-AKAAAAKAAAAKAAGY-NH2 or Ac-YGAKAAAAKAAAAKAA-NH2). At the N-terminus of an α-helix, both phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation stabilized the α-helix relative to the free hydroxyls, with a larger induced structure for phosphorylation than for OGlcNAcylation, for the dianionic phosphate than for the monoanionic phosphate, and for modifications on threonine than for modifications on serine. Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine resulted in peptides more α-helical than alanine at the N-terminus, with dianionic phosphothreonine the most α-helix-stabilizing residue here. In contrast, in the interior of the α-helix, both post-translational modifications were destabilizing with respect to the α-helix, with the greatest destabilization seen for threonine OGlcNAcylation at residue 5 and threonine phosphorylation at residue 10, with peptides containing either post-translational modification existing as random coils. At the C-terminus, both OGlcNAcylation and phosphorylation were destabilizing with respect to the α-helix, though the induced structural changes were less than in the interior of the α-helix. In general, the structural effects of modifications on threonine were greater than the effects on serine, because of both the lower α-helical propensity of Thr and the more defined induced structures upon modification of threonine than serine, suggesting threonine residues are particularly important loci for structural effects of post-translational modifications. The effects of serine and threonine post-translational modifications are analogous to the effects of proline on α-helices, with the effects of phosphothreonine being greater than those of proline throughout the α-helix. These results provide a basis for understanding the context-dependent structural effects of these competing protein post-translational modifications. "

The activity of HSFs is controlled largely by post-translational modifications (PTMs). For example, basal phosphorylation of HSF1 on three serine sites suppresses the heat shock response, and hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 on several other serine and threonine sites by stress-activated kinases results in its activation, while acetylation on K80 inhibits its DNA-binding ability. Sumoylation of HSF2 on K82 regulates its DNA-binding ability, whereas sumoylation of HSF4B on K293 represses its transcriptional activity. With the advancement of proteomic technology, novel PTM sites on various HSFs have been identified with the use of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), but the functions of many of these PTMs are still unclear. Yet, it should be noted that the discovery of these novel PTM sites provided the necessary evidence for the existence of these PTM marks in vivo. Followed by subsequent functional analysis, this would ultimately lead to a better understanding of these PTM marks. MS/MS-based proteomic approach is becoming a gold standard in PTM validation in the field of life science. Here, the recent literature of all known PTMs reported on human HSFs and the resulting functions will be discussed."

Insulinotropic actions of the incretins involve modulation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. In multiple cell types, Kv channel activity has been implicated in cell volume changes accompanying initiation of the apoptotic program. Focusing on Kv2.1, we examined whether regulation of Kv channels in β-cells contributes to the prosurvival effects of incretins. Overexpression of Kv2.1 in INS-1 β-cells potentiated apoptosis in response to mitochondrial and ER stress and, conversely, co-stimulation with GIP/GLP-1 uncoupled this potentiation, suppressing apoptosis. In parallel, incretins promoted phosphorylation and acetylation of Kv2.1 via pathways involving protein kinase A (PKA)/mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK-1) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC). Further studies demonstrated that acetylation of Kv2.1 was mediated by incretin actions on nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of CREB binding protein (CBP) and its interaction with Kv2.1. Regulation of β-cell survival by GIP and GLP-1 therefore involves post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Kv channels by PKA/MSK-1 and HAT/HDAC. This appears to be the first demonstration of modulation of delayed rectifier Kv channels contributing to the β-cell prosurvival effects of incretins and of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulated export of a nuclear lysine acetyltransferase that regulates cell surface ion channel function."

The present contribution describes a method by which peptides carrying specific PTMs of interest-in this study, methylarginines-may be selectively targeted for MS/MS: peptide features are extracted from high mass accuracy single-stage MS data, searched against theoretical PTM-carrying peptide masses, and matching features are subjected to targeted data acquisition LC-MS/MS. Using trypsin digested Saccharomyces cerevisiae Npl3, in which evidence is presented for 18 methylarginine sites-17 of which fall within a glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domain spanning <120 amino acids-it is shown that this approach outperforms conventional data dependent acquisition (DDA): when applied to a complex protein mixture featuring in vivo methylated Npl3, 95% more (P=0.030) methylarginine-carrying peptides are selected for MS/MS than DDA, leading to an 86% increase (P=0.044) in the number of methylated peptides producing Mascot ion scores ≥20 following electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). Notably, significantly more low abundance arginine methylated peptides (maximum ion intensities <6×10(4) cps) are selected for MS/MS using this approach relative to DDA (50% more in a digest of purified in vitro methylated Npl3). It is also demonstrated that relative to collision-induced dissociation (CID), ETD facilitates a 586% increase (P=0.016) in average Mascot ion scores of methylarginine-carrying peptides.

One mechanism proposed to regulate HOX activity is differential post-translational modification (PTM). As a first step in investigating this hypothesis, the sites of PTM on a Sex combs reduced protein fused to a triple tag (SCRTT) extracted from developing embryos were identified by Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). The PTMs identified include phosphorylation at S185, S201, T315, S316, T317 and T324, acetylation at K218, S223, S227, K309, K434 and K439, formylation at K218, K309, K325, K341, K369, K434 and K439, methylation at S19, S166, K168 and T364, carboxylation at D108, K298, W307, K309, E323, K325 and K369, and hydroxylation at P22, Y87, P107, D108, D111, P269, P306, R310, N321, K325, Y334, R366, P392 and Y398.

SLiMs are proposed to be preferential sites of phosphorylation. Although 6 of 7 phosphosites map to regions of predicted SLiMs, we find no support for the hypothesis that the individual S, T and Y residues of predicted SLiMs are phosphorylated more frequently than S, T and Y residues outside of predicted SLiMs."

In eukaryotes, IDPs and IDRs contain the preferred loci for both alternative splicing (AS) and many post-translational modifications (PTMs). Furthermore, AS and/or PTMs at these loci generally alter the signaling outcomes associated with these IDPs or IDRs, where the functional cooperation of these three features is named the IDP-AS-PTM toolkit. However, the prevalence of such functional modulations remains unknown. Also, the signal-altering mechanisms by which AS, and PTMs modulate function and the extent to which AS and PTMs collaborate in their signaling modulations have not been well defined for particular protein examples. Here we focus on three important signaling and regulatory IDR-containing protein families in humans, namely, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are transmembrane proteins; the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFATs), which are transcription factors; and the Src family kinases (SFKs), which are signaling enzymes. The goals here are to determine how AS and PTMs individually alter the outcomes of the signaling carried out by the various IDRs and to determine whether AS and PTMs work together to bring about differential cellular responses. We also present data indicating that a wide range of other signaling IDPs or IDRs undergo both AS- and PTM-based modifications, suggesting that they, too, likely take advantage of signal outcome modulations that result from collaboration between these two events. Hence, we propose that the widespread cooperation of IDPs, AS and/or PTMs provides an IDP-AS-PTM toolkit and substantially contributes to the vast complexity of eukaryotic cell signaling systems."

Thus, it is important to identify additional novel stem cell markers. We used glycoproteomics to discover surface glycoproteins on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that may be useful stem cell markers. We found that a surface glycoprotein, leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 1 (LRRN1), is expressed abundantly on the surface of hESCs before differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Silencing of LRRN1 with short hairpin RNA (shLRRN1) in hESCs resulted in decreased capacity of self-renewal, and skewed differentiation toward endoderm/mesoderm lineages in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the protein expression levels of the pluripotency factors OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 were reduced. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of these pluripotency factors were not affected in LRRN1 silenced cells, but protein half-lives were substantially shortened. Furthermore, we found LRRN1 silencing led to nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of all three pluripotency factors. In addition, the effects on nuclear export were mediated by AKT phosphorylation. These results suggest that LRRN1 plays an important role in maintaining the protein stability of pluripotency factors through AKT phosphorylation, thus maintaining hESC self-renewal capacity and pluripotency. Overall, we found that LRRN1 contributes to pluripotency of hESC by preventing translocation of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 from nucleus to cytoplasm, thereby lessening their post-translational modification and degradation.

First, we find significant overlap of ubiquitination and acetylation within RRM domains, suggesting the possibility for ubiquitination-acetylation crosstalk. Additionally, an analysis of quantitative study of ubiquitination changes in response to proteasome inhibition highlights the uniqueness of RRM domain ubiquitination - RRM domain ubiquitination decreases in response to proteasome inhibition, whereas the majority of sites increase. Second, we found conservation of tyrosine phosphorylation within the RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences, which coordinate RNA binding - suggesting a possible role for regulation of RNA binding by tyrosine kinase signaling.

A compelling description of ligand-mediated gene activation has been unveiled in the last decade that firmly establishes this receptor's central role in the metabolism and transport of xenobiotics in mammals. Interestingly, pharmacotherapy with potent PXR ligands produces several profound side effects including decreased capacities for gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation; likely due to PXR-mediated repression of gene expression programs underlying these pivotal physiological functions. An integrated model is emerging that reveals a sophisticated interplay between ligand binding and the ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation status of this important nuclear receptor protein. These discoveries point to a key role for the post-translational modification of PXR in the selective suppression of gene expression, and open the door to the study of completely new modes of regulation of the biological activity of PXR."

Genome mapping and the study of protein post-translational modifications have revealed the astounding chemical complexity present in the proteome of even the simplest organisms. The identification and characterisation of the modifications present on specific proteins in such complex mixtures has become a central challenge for post-genomic functional studies in cell and systems biology. In the chemical proteomic approach to this problem, protein-modifying enzymes and bioorthogonal chemoselective elaboration are exploited to deliver chemical tags to specific modified residues, enabling new advances in our understanding of protein modification."

It is involved in several basic cellular processes, including gene regulation, embryonic development and terminal differentiation, and also in various pathophysiological mechanisms linked to severe human diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Deimination, the calcium-dependent enzymatic conversion of peptidyl-arginine to peptidyl-citrulline, induces a decrease in the charge of the modified proteins with major consequences on their conformation, stability and/or interactions, and therefore on their functions. Five isotypes of peptidylarginine deiminases (1-4 and 6), exist in humans with a variable tissue expression. These highly conserved enzymes are closely regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, probably including auto-deimination."

FXR deficiency in mice results in cholestasis, metabolic disorders, and tumorigenesis in liver and intestine. FXR is known to contribute to pathogenesis by regulating gene transcription; however, changes in the post-transcriptional modification of proteins associated with FXR modulation have not been determined. In the current study, proteomic analysis of the livers of wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (FXR-KO) mice treated with a FXR synthetic ligand or vehicle was performed. The results identified five proteins as novel FXR targets. Since FXR deficiency in mice leads to liver tumorigenesis, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family, member 1 (Parp1) that is important for DNA repair, was validated in the current study by quantitative real-time PCR, and 1- and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis/western blot. The results showed that Parp1 mRNA levels were not altered by FXR genetic status or by agonist treatment. However, total Parp1 protein levels were increased in FXR-KO mice as early as 3 month old. Interestingly, total Parp1 protein levels were increased in WT mice in an age-dependent manner (from 3 to 18 months), but not in FXR-KO mice. Finally, activation of FXR in WT mice resulted in reduction of phosporylated Parp1 protein in the liver without affecting total Parp1 protein levels. In conclusion, this study reveals that FXR genetic status and agonist treatment affects basal levels and phosphorylation state of Parp1, respectively. These alterations, in turn, may be associated with the hepatobiliary alterations observed in FXR-KO mice and participate in FXR agonist-induced protection in the liver."

The expression of RGS proteins is highly dynamic and is regulated by epigenetic, transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. This review summarizes studies that report dysregulation of RGS protein expression in disease states, and presents examples of drugs that regulate RGS protein expression. Additionally, this review discusses, in detail, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating RGS protein expression, and further assesses the therapeutic potential of targeting these mechanisms. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of RGS proteins is essential for the development of therapeutics that indirectly modulate G protein signaling by regulating expression of RGS proteins."

Assembly protein AP180 is a synapse-specific phosphoprotein and O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modified glycoprotein. AP180 is involved in the assembly of clathrin coated vesicles in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Unlike other types of O-glycosylation, O-GlcNAc is nucleocytoplasmic and reversible. It was thought to be a terminal modification, that is, the O-GlcNAc was not found to be additionally modified in any way. We now show that AP180 purified from rat brain contains a phosphorylated O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc-P) within a highly conserved sequence. O-GlcNAc or O-GlcNAc-P, but not phosphorylation alone, was found at Thr-310. Analysis of synthetic GlcNAc-6-P produced identical fragmentation products to GlcNAc-P from AP180. Direct O-linkage of GlcNAc-P to a Thr residue was confirmed by electron transfer dissociation MS. A second AP180 tryptic peptide was also glycosyl phosphorylated, but the site of modification was not assigned. Sequence similarities suggest there may be a common motif within AP180 involving glycosyl phosphorylation and dual flanking phosphorylation sites within 4 amino acid residues. This novel type of protein glycosyl phosphorylation adds a new signaling mechanism to the regulation of neurotransmission and more complexity to the study of O-GlcNAc modification."

Most post-translational protein modifications occur in a relatively low number of bacterial proteins in comparison with eukaryotic proteins, and most of the modified proteins carry low, substoichiometric levels of modification; therefore, their structural and functional analysis is particularly challenging. The number of modifying enzymes differs greatly among bacterial species, and the extent of the modified proteome strongly depends on environmental conditions. Nevertheless, evidence is rapidly accumulating that protein post-translational modifications have vital roles in various cellular processes such as protein synthesis and turnover, nitrogen metabolism, the cell cycle, dormancy, sporulation, spore germination, persistence and virulence. Further research of protein post-translational modifications will fill current gaps in the understanding of bacterial physiology and open new avenues for treatment of infectious diseases."

Functional competence is conferred upon these cells during a post-testicular phase of sperm maturation in the epididymis. Remarkably, this functional transformation of epididymal spermatozoa occurs in the absence of nuclear gene transcription or protein translation. To understand the cellular mechanisms underpinning epididymal maturation, we have performed a label-free, MS-based, comparative quantification of peptides from caput, corpus and caudal epididymal spermatozoa. In total, 68 phosphopeptide changes could be detected during epididymal maturation corresponding to the identification of 22 modified proteins. Included in this list are the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter, the sperm specific serine kinase 1, AKAP4 and protein kinase A regulatory subunit. Furthermore, four phosphopeptide changes came from Izumo1, the sperm-egg fusion protein, in the cytoplasmic segment of the protein. 2D-PAGE confirmed that Izumo1 is post-translationally modified during epididymal transit. Interestingly, phosphorylation on Izumo1 was detected on residue S339 in the caput and corpus but not caudal cells. Furthermore, Izumo1 exhibited four phosphorylated residues when spermatozoa reached the cauda, which were absent from caput cells. A model is advanced suggesting that these phospho-regulations are likely to act as a scaffold for the association of adaptor proteins with Izumo1 as these cells prepare for fertilization."

T4P continuously elongate and retract. These pilus dynamics crucially affect the local order, shape, and fluidity of microcolonies. The major pilin subunit of the T4P bears multiple post-translational modifications. By interfering with different steps of the pilin glycosylation and phosphoform modification pathways, we investigated the effect of pilin post-translational modification on the shape and dynamics of microcolonies formed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Deleting the phosphotransferase responsible for phosphoethanolamine modification at residue serine 68 inhibits shape relaxations of microcolonies after perturbation and causes bacteria carrying the phosphoform modification to segregate to the surface of mixed colonies. We relate these mesoscopic phenotypes to increased attractive forces generated by T4P between cells. Moreover, by deleting genes responsible for the pilin glycan structure, we show that the number of saccharides attached at residue serine 63 affects the ratio between surface tension and viscosity and cause sorting between bacteria carrying different pilin glycoforms. We conclude that different pilin post-translational modifications moderately affect the attractive forces between bacteria but have severe effects on the material properties of microcolonies."

All (de-)phosphorylation reactions are described with a generic Michaelis-Menten scheme, and all species freely diffuse without pre-existing gradients. Computational simulation upon >23,000,000 randomly generated parameter sets revealed the design motifs of cyclic reaction and enzyme sequestration by slow-diffusing substrates. These motifs constitute short-range positive and long-range negative feedback loops to induce Turing instability. The width and height of spatial patterns can be controlled independently by distinct reaction-diffusion processes. Therefore, multisite reversible post-translational modification can be a ubiquitous source for various patterns without requiring other complex regulations such as autocatalytic regulation of enzymes and is applicable to molecular mechanisms for inducing subcellular localization of proteins driven by post-translational modifications."

However, the type of post-translational modification that confers the specific binding affinity of maspin to target molecules, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), has not been determined. The aim of this study, therefore, is to analyze the molecular heterogeneity of maspin and to identify its modifications in the normal mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, which is known to express the maspin protein abundantly, using electrophoretic analysis. Conventional SDS-PAGE analysis of MCF-10A cell extracts showed that endogenous maspin is composed of both an intact form observed as a 42 kDa band and a smaller form observed as a 36 kDa band. Interestingly, a brief exposure of MCF-10A cells to 10 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) led to the appearance of a novel endogenous maspin form, as demonstrated by non-denaturing PAGE and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional sequential non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE supported that this novel form was generated by intramolecular disulfide-bonded linkage under oxidative stress, and this oxidized maspin form also existed under physiological conditions. Furthermore, a glutathione (GSH) bead pull-down assay revealed that the intramolecular disulfide-bonded maspin lost its binding activity to endogenous GST, indicating that intramolecular disulfide-bonded maspin might have some distinct properties under oxidative stress, although the precise biological significance of this modification remains elusive. In conclusion, we have shown that maspin undertakes different modifications under oxidative stress."

Thus, it is evident that contemporary genetic approaches have failed to explain the etiology or etiologies of ALS/FTD and PD. Recent investigations have explored the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in disease development. Epigenetics comprises heritable changes in gene utilization that are not derived from changes in the genome. A main epigenetic mechanism involves the post-translational modification of histones. Increased knowledge of the epigenomic landscape of neurodegenerative diseases would not only further our understanding of the disease pathologies, but also lead to the development of treatments able to halt their progress.

A naturally modified HWTX-IV (mHWTX-IV), having a molecular mass 18 Da lower than HWTX-IV, has also been isolated from the venom of the same spider. By a combination of enzymatic fragmentation and MS/MS de novo sequencing, mHWTX-IV has been shown to have the same amino acid sequence as that of HWTX-IV, except that the N-terminal glutamic acid replaced by pyroglutamic acid. mHWTX-IV inhibited tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels of dorsal root ganglion neurons with an IC50 nearly equal to native HWTX-IV. mHWTX-IV showed the same activation and inactivation kinetics seen for native HWTX-IV. In contrast with HWTX-IV, which dissociates at moderate voltage depolarization voltages (+50 mV, 180000 ms), mHWTX-IV inhibition of TTX-sensitive sodium channels is not reversed by strong depolarization voltages (+200 mV, 500 ms). Recovery of Nav1.7current was voltage-dependent and was induced by extreme depolarization in the presence of HWTX-IV, but no obvious current was elicited after application of mHWTX-IV. Our data indicate that the N-terminal modification of HWTX-IV gives the peptide toxin a greater ability to trap the voltage sensor in the sodium channel. Loss of a negative charge, caused by cyclization at the N-terminus, is a possible reason why the modified toxin binds much stronger. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pyroglutamic acid residue in a spider toxin; this modification seems to increase the trapping ability of the voltage sensor in the sodium channel. "

For example, ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as MDM2 (which ubiquitylates p53) and inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, and deubiquitinases, such as A20 and ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) (which regulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation 1 (MCL1), respectively), have important roles in apoptosis. Therapeutic agents that target apoptotic regulatory proteins, including those that are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, might afford clinical benefits."
