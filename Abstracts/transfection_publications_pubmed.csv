31953060,,Alteration of SC35 localization by transfection reagents.,2020,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2020.118650,"['Arun Prasath Damodaran', 'Thibault Courthéoux', 'Erwan Watrin', 'Claude Prigent']","['Cytoplasmic granules', 'JetPRIME', 'SC35', 'Speckles', 'Splicing', 'Transfection']","Transfection is a powerful tool that enables introducing foreign nucleic acids into living cells in order to study the function of a gene product. Ever since the discovery of transfection many side effects or artifacts caused by transfection reagents have been reported. Here, we show that the transfection reagent, JetPRIME alters the localization of the splicing protein SC35 widely used as a nuclear speckle marker. We demonstrate that transfection of plasmids with JetPRIME leads to enlarged SC35 speckles and SC35 cytoplasmic granules. By contrast, transfection of the same plasmid with Lipofectamine 3000 does not have any effect on SC35 localization. The formation of SC35 cytoplasmic granules by JetPRIME-mediated transfection is independent of exogenous expression by plasmid and although similar in morphology they are distinct from P-bodies and stress granules. This method of transfection affected only SC35 and phosphorylated SR proteins but not the nuclear speckles. The JetPRIME-mediated transfection also showed compromised transcription in cells with enlarged SC35 speckles. Our work indicates that the use of JetPRIME alters SC35 localization and can affect gene expression and alternative splicing. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting results after the use of a transient transfection system, particularly when the subject of the study is the function of a protein in the control of gene expression or mRNA splicing."

By transferring the piece of DNA that we are interested in, we can alter the expression of certain gene or genes to further characterize its role in the cell function or in the organism's development, metabolism, immune system, etc. Transfection reagents that enable efficient delivery of the DNA to the cells are important tools in the molecular and cellular biology studies. There are chemical products and tools that have been used for transfection of the cells but they are not as efficient as desired or they can induce cytotoxicity. It is crucial to design and generate new transfection reagents to further support the field of biotechnology, molecular studies, cellular biology, and in vitro studies relying on them. The more efficient and the less cytotoxic compounds will be especially useful for the field. We synthesized a new set of benzimidazole-based transfection reagents that have higher efficiency to carry GFP expressing plasmid in to the mammalian cells compared with the commercially available ones with low cytotoxicity. GFP expression levels were tracked by flow cytometry to determine the transfection efficiencies. Benzimidazole-based transfection reagents can be safely used for transfection studies in tissue culture as well as in gene therapy applications due to their high efficiency in the gene transfer to the mammalian cells."

We developed a Flow Micropillar-array Electroporation (FME) system to wisely regulate an important transmembrane-determining factor, namely cell size variations among individual cells, to achieve effective transfection. In FME, cells flow through a slit-type microfluidic channel on which carbon electrodes with well-patterned micropillar array texture are integrated as the top and bottom wall. Gravity helps bring cells to the micropillar array surface so that the permeable area on cells in different size populations is specified by their size regardless their random location fact. Without sacrificing cell viability, we demonstrate this FME concept by delivering DNA plasmids to several mammalian cell lines with obvious transfection enhancement when compared to a commercial system (K562: 3.0 folds; A549: 3.3 folds; HeLa: 1.8 folds, COS7: 1.7 folds; 293T: 2.9 folds; mES: 2.5 folds). Moreover, carbon-based electrodes are less expensive, more durable, and convenient for integration with a microfluidic setup which enables rapid and massive transfection capability that many therapeutic application needs. The success of FME may benefit many emerging biological studies and clinical practice that requires effective transfection to a large population of cells in limited processing time."

However, various condensed agents have distinct transfection efficiency and cellular cytotoxicity. The object of this study was to screen the optimal agents with the high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity from four polymer compressive materials, polyethylenimine (PEI), chitosan, poly-l-lysine (PLL), and spermidine. DNA was precompressed with these four agents and then combined to cationic liposomes. Subsequently, the entrapment and transfection efficiency of the obtained complexes were investigated. Finally, the particle sizes, cytotoxicity, and endocytosis fashion of these copolymers (Lipo-PEI, Lipo-chitosan, Lipo-PLL, and Lipo-spermidine) were examined. It was found that these four copolymers had significantly lower cytotoxicity and higher transfection efficiency (45.5%, 42.4%, 36.8%, and 47.4%, respectively) than those in the control groups. The transfection efficiency of Lipo-PEI and Lipo-spermidine copolymers were better than the other two copolymers. In 293T cells, nystatin significantly inhibited the transfection efficiency of Lipo-PEI-DNA and Lipo-spermidine-DNA (51.88% and 46.05%, respectively), which suggest that the endocytosis pathway of Lipo-spermidine and Lipo-PEI copolymers was probably caveolin dependent. Our study indicated that these dual-degradable copolymers especially liposome-spermidine copolymer could be used as the potential biocompatible gene delivery carriers."

The development of genetic manipulation techniques, such as transfection technology, is pivotal to improve knowledge regarding the biology of these poorly studied parasites towards better disease control strategies. For Babesia ovis, responsible for ovine babesiosis, a tick-borne disease of small ruminants, these tools are not yet available. The present study was based on the existence of interchangeable cross-species functional promoters between Babesia species. Herein, we describe for the first time B. ovis transient transfection using two heterologous promoters, the ef-1α-B intergenic regions from B. bovis and B. ovata. Their ability to drive expression of a reporter luciferase in B. ovis supports their cross-species functionality. Also, the ef-1α-B promoter region from B. ovata resulted in statistically significantly higher luminescence values in comparison to the control, thus a possibly suitable promoter for stable gene expression. Evaluation of transfection efficiency using qPCR demonstrated that higher luminescence levels were due to promoter strength rather than a higher transfection efficiency. These findings represent a step forward in the development of methods for B. ovis genetic manipulation, an undoubtedly necessary tool to study this parasite basic biology, including its life cycle, the parasite interactions with host cells and virulence factors."

We present a novel plasmonic optoporation technique that uses Au nanostar layers immobilized in culture microplate wells. HeLa cells were grown directly on Au nanostar layers, after which they were subjected to continuous-wave 808 nm laser irradiation. An Au monolayer density ~15 μg/cm"

We compared the conditions for effective introduction of transgenes into Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) cell lines by evaluating the cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency of three commercially available transfection reagents: Lipofectamine 2000, X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent, and GeneJuice Transfection Reagent. Plasmid vectors containing the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein were mixed with each of the transfection reagents using reagent-to-plasmid ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Then, the complexes were used to transfect three Siberian sturgeon cell lines derived from the heart, head kidney, and gonad. Cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency were measured via flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. No significant cytotoxicity was observed at the optimal treatment conditions in all cases, with the exception of Lipofectamine 2000-treated gonad-derived cells. Although the transfection efficiencies in A. baerii cells were generally low, X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent showed the highest transfection efficiency at ratios of 2:1 or 4:1, depending on the cell type. Hence, X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent can be used to effectively transfer foreign genes into three A. baerii cell lines."

Performing these operations often requires simultaneous delivery of many genes, and optimizing the stoichiometry of these genes can yield drastic improvements in performance. However, sufficiently sampling the large design space of gene expression stoichiometries in mammalian cells using current methods is cumbersome, complex, or expensive. We present a 'poly-transfection' method as a simple yet high-throughput alternative that enables comprehensive evaluation of genetic systems in a single, readily-prepared transfection sample. Each cell in a poly-transfection represents an independent measurement at a distinct gene expression stoichiometry, fully leveraging the single-cell nature of transfection experiments. We first benchmark poly-transfection against co-transfection, showing that titration curves for commonly-used regulators agree between the two methods. We then use poly-transfections to efficiently generate new insights, for example in CRISPRa and synthetic miRNA systems. Finally, we use poly-transfection to rapidly engineer a difficult-to-optimize miRNA-based cell classifier for discriminating cancerous cells. One-pot evaluation enabled by poly-transfection accelerates and simplifies the design of genetic systems, providing a new high-information strategy for interrogating biology."

Although many gene carrier materials and transfection methods have been developed, it remains unclear how cell morphology including cell spreading and elongation affects gene transfection. In this study, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were cultured on micropatterns and transfected with cationic pAcGFP1-N1 plasmid complexes. The relationship between the cell morphology of hMSCs and gene transfection was investigated using micropatterning techniques. Spreading and elongation of hMSCs were precisely controlled by micropatterned surfaces. The results showed that well-spread and elongated hMSCs had high transfection efficiency. Analysis of the uptake of exogenous genes and DNA synthesis activity indicated that the well-spread and elongated cell morphology promoted gene transfection through enhanced uptake of the cationic complexes and accelerated DNA synthesis. The results should provide useful information for understanding of cell morphology on gene transfection and development of efficient gene transfection methods."

As nucleic acids alone are not able to penetrate the cell membrane, an efficient carrier is needed. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles can serve as carrier due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and high affinity to nucleic acids like DNA or RNA. Their application was extended here from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models, including co-cultures. Compared to 2D monolayer cell cultures, a 3D culture system represents a more realistic spatial, biochemical and cellular environment. The uptake of fluorescent calcium phosphate nanoparticles (diameter 40-70 nm; cationic) was studied in 2D and 3D cell culture models by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The transfection of eGFP by calcium phosphate nanoparticles was compared in 2D and 3D cell culture, including co-cultures of green fluorescing HeLa-eGFP cells and MG-63 cells in 2D and in 3D models with the red fluorescent protein mCherry. This permitted a cell-specific assessment of the local transfection efficiency. In general, the penetration of nanoparticles into the spheroids was significantly higher than that of a model oligonucleotide carried by Lipofectamine. The transfection efficiency was comparable in 3D cell cultures with 2D cell cultures, but it occurred preferentially at the surface of the spheroids, following the uptake pathway of the nanoparticles. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Three-dimensional cell culture models can serve as a bridge between the in-vitro cell cultures and the in-vivo situation, especially when mass transfer effects have to be considered. This is the case for nanoparticles where the incubation effect in a two-dimensional cell culture strongly differs from a three-dimensional cell culture or a living tissue. We have compared the uptake of nanoparticles and a subsequent transfection of fluorescent proteins in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell culture models. An elegant model to investigate the transfection in co-cultures was developed using HeLa-eGFP cells (green fluorescent) together with MG-63 cells (non-fluorescent) that were transfected with the red-fluorescing protein mCherry. Thereby, the transfection of both cell types in the co-culture was easily distinguished."

Here, efficient and consistent lipoplex-mediated transfection is demonstrated for hard-to-transfect suspension cells via a single-cell, droplet-microfluidics approach. In these microdroplets, monodisperse lipoplexes for effective gene delivery are generated via chaotic mixing induced by the serpentine microchannel and co-confined with single cells. Moreover, the cell membrane permeability increases due to the shear stress exerted on the single cells when they pass through the droplet pinch-off junction. The transfection efficiency, examined by the delivery of the pcDNA3-EGFP plasmid, improves from ≈5% to ≈50% for all three tested suspension cell lines, i.e., K562, THP-1, Jurkat, and with significantly reduced cell-to-cell variation, compared to the bulk method. Efficient targeted knockout of the TP53BP1 gene for K562 cells via the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-CAS9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) mechanism is also achieved using this platform. Lipoplex-mediated single-cell transfection via droplet microfluidics is expected to have broad applications in gene therapy and regenerative medicine by providing high transfection efficiency and low cell-to-cell variation for hard-to-transfect suspension cells."

Some lipids change in response to both, presumably chemically different, transfection reagents, while other lipid species change only in response to one of the reagents. While the functional implications of these lipidomic alterations remain to be investigated, the authors' experiments suggest that it is important to use appropriate mock transfection controls during RNAi experiments, ideally complemented by an orthogonal perturbation, especially when investigating membrane-associated phenomena."

Although the transfection efficacy and toxicity of transfection reagents varied depending on cell types, the toxicity of transfection reagents generally displayed a positive correlation with their transfection efficacy. According to our results, Lipofectamine 3000, Fugene and RNAiMAX showed high transfection efficacy, however, RNAiMAX may be a better option for majority of cells when lower toxicity is desired. The transfection efficacy of Lipofectamine 2000 was compromised by its high toxicity, which may adversely affect its application in most cells.

Therefore, transfection often results in macrophage activation and degradation of the transfected nucleic acids or even in suicide of the macrophages. Here, we describe a protocol that allows highly efficient transfection of murine primary macrophages such as peritoneal macrophages (PM) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with mRNA in vitro transcribed from DNA templates such as plasmids.

Tumor-homing cells can exert anticancer effects through innate capacities, via transfection with a therapeutic gene or acting as vehicles of therapeutic nanoparticles. In this work, an ultrasound-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticle (capable of carrying an anticancer drug) is engineered to act as a non-viral transfection agent for tumor-tropic human placental mesenchymal stem cells. The successful transfection of the vehicle cells is evaluated employing different expression plasmids. After transfection with two suicide genes, the vehicle cells are capable of converting a non-toxic pro-drug into a highly toxic molecule, which can also kill surrounding cancer cells in an in vitro co-culture model. This work opens the gate for a plethora of strategies in which both genes and drug-loaded nanoparticles can be transported towards tumor tissues by easily available human mesenchymal stem cells."

In particular, polyfection and nucleofection are two widely used systems for nonviral gene delivery. Their potential depends on the transfection efficiency achieved, which is influenced in turn by the type of cells transfected and by the plasmid that carries the gene of interest. The efficiency of transfection by polyfection or nucleofection in human fibroblasts and keratinocytes was evaluated in this study. Transfections were performed with plasmids containing a gene of interest (human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide) and two reporter genes (red or green fluorescent protein) that included or not an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The efficiency was measured by flow cytometry in terms of percentage of cells expressing the reporter gene; viability of transfected cells was also evaluated. It was found that nucleofection was more efficient than polyplexes for transfecting fibroblasts, while no significant differences were found between both systems of transfection when applied to keratinocytes. Regarding the viability of fibroblasts after transfection, values were high in both systems. In contrast, keratinocytes were more sensitive to nucleofection. It was also noted that both types of cells decreased reporter gene expression when IRES sequence was located upstream of the reporter gene, suggesting a negative effect on the expression of this gene. These results confirm that the transfection efficiency depends on the type of cells and the system used."

Thus, innovative strategies that allow safe and efficient intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid drugs at the desired site is urgently needed for a smooth clinical translation of therapeutically appealing siRNA-based technology. In this regard, we have developed an innovative siRNA transfection protocol that employs a short incubation time of just 5 min. This allows easy transfection in suspension followed by transplantation of the cells in a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel system. We also report here the unique ability of siRNA to bind HA that was quantified by siRNA release and rheological characterization of the HA-hydrogel. Such interactions also showed promising results to deliver functional siRNA in suspension transfection conditions within 30 min using native HA, although removal of excess HA by centrifugation seem to be essential. In the 2D experiments, suspension transfection of hMSCs with RNAiMAX resulted in ≈90% gene silencing (with or without removal of the excess reagent by centrifugation), while HA demonstrated a modest ≈40% gene silencing after removal of excess reagent after 30 min. Transplantation of such transfected cells in the HA-hydrogel system demonstrated an improved knockdown (≈90% and ≈60% with RNAiMAX and HA respectively after 48 h), with lower cytotoxicity (up to 5-days) as determined by PrestoBlue assay. The gene silencing efficiency in the 2D and 3D conditions were also confirmed at the protein levels by Western blot analysis. We postulate this novel transfection method could be applied for in vivo applications as it allows minimal manipulation of cells that are to be transplanted and reduce toxicity."

The objective of this study was to investigate the optimal conditions to generate reliable GRT assay data on bovine immortalized cell lines, Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) and bovine mammary epithelial alveolar (MACT) cells. Results are reported for two experiments. In Experiment 1, using 96 well-plate and a robotic inverted fluorescent microscope, we compared transfection efficiency among commercially available transfection reagents (TR) Lipofectamine® 3000 (Lipo3), Lipofectamine® LTX (LipoLTX), and TransIT-X2® (TransX2), three doses of TR (i.e., 0.15, 0.3, and 0.4μL/well), and three doses of Green Fluorescent Protein plasmid DNA (i.e., 10, 25, and 50ng/well). Transfection efficiency and mortality rate were analyzed using CellProfiler software. Transfection efficiency increased until the end of the experiment (20h post-transfection) at which point MACT had greater transfection than MDBK cells (16.3% vs. 2.2%).

Using high, medium, and low transfection efficiency conditions determined in Experiment 1, we performed a GRT assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated response element (PPRE) luciferase in MACT and MDBK cells treated with 10nM or 100nM of synthetic Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor β/σ (PPARβ/σ) agonist. The GRT assay was unaffected by poor transfection in MACT cells although the high transfection hampered the possibility of detecting differences between 10 and 100nM of the PPARβ/δ agonist. In MDBK cells, low transfection efficiency (<2.0%) failed to detect any differences with GRT assay. The level of transfection was positively associated with a lower coefficient of variation of GRT data. Overall, our data indicates that results of GRT assays are affected by transfection efficiency and a minimum transfection of 2% is required. Thus, factors such as TR type, TR amount, and DNA plasmid amount need to be optimized for a specific cell type before performing GRT assays."

After we proved the concept underlying the acoustic-transfection technique, treatment conditions for different human cancer cell lines have been intensively investigated to further develop acoustic-transfection as a versatile and adaptable transfection method by satisfying the requirements of high-delivery efficiency and cell membrane permeability with minimal membrane disruption. To determine optimal treatment conditions for different cell lines, we developed a quantitative intracellular delivery score based on delivery efficiency, cell membrane permeability and cell viability after 4 and 20 h of treatment. The intracellular delivery of macromolecules and the simultaneous intracellular delivery of two molecules under optimal treatment conditions were successfully achieved. We found that DNA plasmid was delivered by acoustic-transfection technique into epiblast stem cells, which expressed transient mCherry fluorescence."

Current treatments fail to target the underlying pathology or promote tissue repair and approaches such as viral transfection raise safety concerns due to mutagenesis and unwarranted immune responses. To avoid such concerns, nonviral transfection is a viable method of gene delivery into the host cell while bypassing the caveats of viral delivery. Brachyury is expressed in the developing notochord and is associated with an immature healthy nucleus pulposus (NP). We hypothesize that Brachyury can reprogram degenerate NP cells to a healthy pro-anabolic phenotype with increased proteoglycan content and decreased expression of catabolic, inflammatory, and neurovascular markers. NP cells obtained from human autopsy and surgical tissues were transfected with plasmids encoding for Brachyury or an empty vector control via bulk electroporation. Post transfection, cells were seeded in three-dimensional agarose constructs cultured over 4 weeks and analyzed for viability, gene expression, and proteoglycan. Results demonstrated successful transfection of both autopsy and surgical NP cells. We observed long-term Brachyury expression, significant increased expression of NP phenotypic markers FOXF1, KRT19, and chondrogenic marker SOX9 with decreases in inflammatory cytokines IL1-β/IL6, NGF, and MMPs and significant increases in glycosaminoglycan accumulation. These results highlight nonviral transfection with developmental transcription factors, such as Brachyury, as a promising method to reprogram degenerate human disc cells toward a healthy NP phenotype.

Herein, we screen a list of commercially available small molecules, including published IFN inhibitors, for their potential to enhance mRNA transfection in BJ fibroblasts. Transfection enhancement is quantified by relative mean fluorescence intensity of translated green fluorescent protein (GFP) in treated cells compared to dimethyl sulfoxide treated controls. Within toxicological constrains, all tested small molecules did not enhance mRNA transfection in BJ fibroblasts while a third of the tested compounds unexpectedly inhibited GFP expression even though IFN-β production is inhibited. Based on the results of our study, we conclude that small molecule inhibitors, including IFN inhibitors, tested in this study do not enhance in vitro mRNA transfection efficiency in human fibroblasts."

Most often performed at low throughput, it is moreover time-consuming and error-prone, even more so when multiplexing several plasmids. We developed an easy, fast, and accurate method to perform cell transfection in a 384-well plate layout using acoustic droplet ejection (ADE) technology. The nanodispenser device used in this study is based on this technology and allows precise nanovolume delivery at high speed from a source well plate to a destination one. It can dispense and multiplex DNA and transfection reagent according to a predesigned spreadsheet. Here we present an optimal protocol to perform ADE-based high-throughput plasmid transfection which makes it possible to reach an efficiency of up to 90% and a nearly 100% cotransfection in cotransfection experiments. We extend initial work by proposing a user-friendly spreadsheet-based macro, able to manage up to four plasmids/wells from a library containing up to 1,536 different plasmids, and a tablet-based pipetting guide application. The macro designs the necessary template(s) of the source plate(s) and generates the ready-to-use files for the nanodispenser and tablet-based application. The four-steps transfection protocol involves i) a diluent dispense with a classical liquid handler, ii) plasmid distribution and multiplexing, iii) a transfection reagent dispense by the nanodispenser, and iv) cell plating on the prefilled wells. The described software-based control of ADE plasmid multiplexing and transfection allows even nonspecialists in the field to perform a reliable cell transfection in a fast and safe way. This method enables rapid identification of optimal settings for a given cell type and can be transposed to higher-scale and manual approaches. The protocol eases applications, such as human ORFeome protein (set of open reading frames [ORFs] in a genome) expression or CRISPR-Cas9-based gene function validation, in nonpooled screening strategies."

Taking advantage of a new transfection-compatible media formulation that permits prolonged, high-density culture, we optimized transfection parameters (cell density, plasmid vector and polyethylenimine concentrations) and post-transfection culture conditions to establish a new, high-performing process for rapid protein production. The growth media is chemically defined, and a single hydrolysate feed is added post-transfection, followed by periodic glucose supplementation.

In order to overcome this endosomal-release bottleneck, methods are required that measure nanocarrier uptake kinetics and transfection efficiency simultaneously. Here, we employ live-cell imaging on single-cell arrays (LISCA) to study the delivery-time distribution of lipid-based mRNA complexes under varied serum conditions. By fitting a translation-maturation model to hundreds of individual eGFP reporter fluorescence time courses, the protein expression onset times and the expression rates after transfection are determined. Using this approach, we find that delivery timing and protein expression rates are not intrinsically correlated at the single-cell level, even though population-averaged values of both parameters conjointly change as a function of increasing external serum protein fraction. Lipofectamine-mediated delivery showed decreased transfection efficiency and longer delivery times with increasing serum protein concentration. This is in contrast to ionizable lipid nanoparticle (i-LNP)-mediated transfer, which showed increased efficiency and faster uptake in the presence of serum. In conclusion, the interdependences of single-cell expression rates and onset timing provide additional clues on uptake and release mechanisms, which are useful for improving nucleic acid delivery."

However, because of the limited cell surfaces in spheroid exposed to DNA/vector, it is difficult to realize efficient gene transfection, most of which highly rely on cell-substrate interaction. Here, we report a poly(l-glutamic acid)-based porous scaffold with tunable inner surfaces that can sequentially realize cell-scaffold attachment and detachment, as well as the followed in situ spheroid formation. The attachment and detachment of cells from scaffold is achieved by the capture and release of fibronectin (Fn) via reversible imine linkage between aromatic aldehyde groups of scaffold and amino groups of Fn. Together with N, N, N-trimethyl chitosan chloride condensing plasmid DNA encoding transforming growth factor-β1 (pDNA-TGF-β1), cell attachment realizes efficient surface-mediated gene transfection. Conversion of scaffold stiffness can affect the adhesion shape of cells. Stiffer scaffold reinforces the adhesion, leading to the amplification of peripheral focal adhesions and the promotion of cell spreading, as well as the promotion of gene transfection efficiency. After cellular detachment from the scaffold via lysine treatment, the subsequent spheroid formation with extensive cell-cell interaction up-regulates the corresponding protein expression with a prolonged term. With the induction effect of the expressed TGF-β1, significantly enhanced chondrogenesis of MSCs in spheroids is achieved at 10 d in vitro. Well-regenerated cartilage at 8 weeks in vivo indicates that the present gene transfection system is a platform that can be potentially applied toward cartilage tissue engineering."

Although this treatment did improve the transfection efficiency, it also induced leakiness in the epithelial barrier by both opening tight junctional complexes and by creating holes in the cell layer because of low-level cell death and detachment. Thus, this approach to enhance the transfection efficiency of polar, differentiated cells will be useful for assessment of the effect of the transfected/expressed protein on (re)formation of an epithelial barrier rather than on a functional barrier itself."

PAMS/DNA/10NLS exhibited marked extracellular and intracellular degradation under acidic conditions. The degradation was believed to allow NLS to come into contact with importins easily, which was able to mediate the nucleus import.

Moreover, the transfection of PAMS/DNA/10NLS was less dependent on the breakdown of the nucleus envelope than PAMS/DNA. Considering that GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) was able to activate the endogenous GTPase, which was necessary for NLS-mediated nucleus import, RanGAP1 overexpressed cells (RanGAP1 cells) were produced. This result showed that RanGAP1 cells had higher GTPase activities than normal cells. Both the nucleus import and transfection efficiency of PAMS/DNA/10NLS were markedly higher in RanGAP1 cells than that in normal cells.

Here, we describe a materials-based approach whereby application of a bioresorbable mineral coating improves microparticle-based transfection of plasmid DNA lipoplexes in several primary human cell types. In the presence of these mineral-coated microparticles (MCMs), we observed up to 4-fold increases in transfection efficiency with simultaneous reductions in cytotoxicity. We identified mechanisms by which MCMs improve transfection, as well as coating compositions that improve transfection in three-dimensional cell constructs. The approach afforded efficient transfection in primary human fibroblasts as well as mesenchymal and embryonic stem cells for both two- and three-dimensional transfection strategies. This MCM-based transfection is an advancement in gene delivery technology, as it represents a non-viral approach that enables highly efficient, localized transfection and allows for transfection of three-dimensional cell constructs."

Here, we present a simple, rapid and robust flow cytometric method that can be used as a tool to optimize transfection efficiency at the single cell level while overcoming limitations of prior established methods that quantify transfection efficiency. By using optimized ratios of transfection reagent and a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) vector directly labeled with a fluorochrome, this method can be used as a tool to simultaneously quantify cellular toxicity of different transfection reagents, the amount of nucleic acid plasmid that cells have taken up during transfection as well as the amount of the encoded expressed protein. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is reproducible, can be standardized and can reliably and rapidly quantify transfection efficiency, reducing assay costs and increasing throughput while increasing data robustness."

Here, a high frequency ultrasound-based remote intracellular delivery technique capable of delivery of multiple DNA plasmids, messenger RNAs, and recombinant proteins is developed to allow high spatiotemporal visualization and analysis of gene and protein expressions as well as single-cell gene editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9), a method called acoustic-transfection. Acoustic-transfection has advantages over typical sonoporation because acoustic-transfection utilizing ultra-high frequency ultrasound over 150 MHz can directly deliver gene and proteins into cytoplasm without microbubbles, which enables controlled and local intracellular delivery to acoustic-transfection technique.

Plasmid-based gene editing (such as with CRISPR-Cas9) can require the delivery of plasmids that are large (∼9.5-13 kbp) in comparison to common reporter plasmids (∼5-8 kbp). To develop more efficient plasmid delivery vehicles, we investigated the effect of plasmid size on the transfection of primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using a heparin-treated trehalose-containing polycation (Tr4-heparin). Transfections with 4.7 kbp to 10 kbp plasmids exhibited high rates of polyplex internalization with both plasmid sizes. However, transfection with the large plasmid was nearly eliminated in HDFs and significantly reduced in iPSCs. Molecular additives were used to probe intracellular barriers to transfection. Chloroquine treatments were used to destabilize endosomes, and dexamethasone and thymidine were used to destabilize the nuclear envelope. Destabilizing the nuclear envelope resulted in significantly increased large-plasmid-transfection, indicating that nuclear localization may be more difficult for large plasmids. To demonstrate the potential clinical utility of this formulation, HDFs and iPSCs were treated with to dexamethasone-Tr4-heparin polyplexes encoding dCas9-VP64, synthetic transcription activator, targeted to collagen type VII. These transfections enhanced collagen expression in HDFs and iPSCs by 5- and 20-fold, respectively, compared to an untransfected control and were the more effective than the Lipofectamine 2000 control.

The in situ transfection results demonstrated that although the incorporated PCL fibers effectively improved cell morphology, the bioactivity and proliferation rates of surface cells were not significantly increased due to the high ratio of alginate fibers. However, the reduction of the alginate ratio may decrease transfection efficiency because the immobilization of nonviral vectors linearly depended on the density of alginate fibers. To maintain transfection efficiency and increase biocompatibility, the stability of alginate fibers were manipulated by adjusting the concentrations of calcium ions during crosslinking. These partially crosslinked alginate fibers were initially intact to allow nanoparticle adsorption for cell uptake, and then gradually degraded in days to create an appropriate environment for cell survival.

Detailed studies were carried out on the effects of the PDMAEMA polymerization time, the Ca(2+) concentration, and the incubation time of Ca(2+)@DNA complex with PDMAEMA-modified SiNWAs (SN-PDM) on the gene transfection in the cells. The results demonstrated that the transfection efficiency of SN-PDM assisted traditional Ca(2+)-dependent transfection was significantly enhanced compared to those without any surface assistance, and SN-PDM with polymerization time 24 h exhibited the highest efficiency. Moreover, the optimal transfection efficiency was found at the system of a complex containing Ca(2+) (100 mM) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) incubated on SN-PDM for 20 min. Compared with unmodified SiNWAs, SN-PDM has little cytotoxicity and can improve cell attachment.

Here we focus on the optimization of: (a) CaP nanoparticle precipitation conditions, predominantly supersaturation and Ca/P molar ratios; (b) transfection conditions, mainly the concentrations of the carrier and plasmid DNA; (c) the presence of surface additives, including citrate anion and cationic poly(l-lysine) (PLL). CaP nanoparticles significantly improved transfection with plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells compared to a commercial non-viral carrier. At the same time they elicited significantly lesser cytotoxicity than the commercial carrier. Plasmid DNA acted as a nucleation promoter, decreasing the nucleation lag time of metastable CaP solutions and leading to a higher rate of nucleation and a lower size of the precipitated particles. The degree of supersaturation (DS) of 15 was found to be more optimal for transfection than that of 12.5 or 17.5 and higher. Because CaP particles precipitated at DS 15 were spherical, while DS 17.5 and 21 yielded acicular particles, it was concluded that spherical particle morphologies were more conducive to transfection than the anisotropic ones. Even though the yield at DS 15 was 10 and 100 times lower than that at DS 17.5 and 21, respectively, transfection rates were higher using CaP nanoparticle colloids prepared at DS 15 than using those made at higher or lower DS, indicating that the right particle morphology can outweigh the difference in the amount of the carrier, even when this difference is close to 100×. In contrast to the commercial carrier, the concentration of CaP-pDNA delivered to the cells was directly proportional to the transfection rate. Osteosarcoma K7M2 cells were four times more easily transfectable with CaP nanoparticles than the MC3T3-E1 cells. The addition of citrate increased the transfection rate at lower concentrations; however, a complete redispersal of CaP-pDNA nanoparticles at higher concentrations of citrate coincided with a complete diminishment of transfection, implying the benefits of partial aggregation of CaP nanoparticles carrying pDNA. In contrast, PLL delayed transfection initially, but enhanced it at longer time points (⩾96h), leading to the conclusion that both citrate and PLL could exert positive effects on transfection: citrate if added at low concentrations and PLL to extend transfection over longer periods of time.

In bovines, the progress of this technology has been slow due to the poor reproducibility and efficiency of the production of transgenic embryos. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different sperm transfection systems on the quality and functional parameters of sperm. Additionally, the ability of sperm to bind and incorporate exogenous DNA was assessed. These analyses were carried out by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy, and motility parameters were also evaluated by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Transfection was carried out using complexes of plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine, SuperFect and TurboFect for 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 h. The results showed that all of the transfection treatments promoted sperm binding and incorporation of exogenous DNA, similar to sperm incorporation of DNA alone, without affecting the viability. Nevertheless, the treatments and incubation times significantly affected the motility parameters, although no effect on the integrity of DNA or the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed. Additionally, we observed that transfection using SuperFect and TurboFect negatively affected the acrosome integrity, and TurboFect affected the mitochondrial membrane potential of sperm. In conclusion, we demonstrated binding and incorporation of exogenous DNA by sperm after transfection and confirmed the capacity of sperm to spontaneously incorporate exogenous DNA. These findings will allow the establishment of the most appropriate method [intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF)] of generating transgenic embryos via SMGT based on the fertilization capacity of transfected sperm."

To improve gene immobilization, direct-current electric field (DCEF) was applied to guide cationic polyplexes toward nanofibers on cathode. Fluorescent labeling experiments suggested that the applied DCEF not only accelerated but also increased the saturation levels of gene immobilization. Interestingly, these DCEF also increased the degradation of nanofibers. The water contact angle and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry results indicated that the degraded component was mainly alginate. It suggested that the DCEF treatment may cause the electrophoresis of calcium ions to destabilize alginates fibers, and thus the degradation rates increased with the applied voltages. This alginate degradation increased the ratio of PCL in composite fibers, so the cell adhesion, viability, and proliferation were improved. Finally, these DCEF-treated fibers were used for substrate-mediated gene delivery. The transfection efficiency highly increased with DCEF when the voltages were lower than 1.5 V.

Cationic lipid-mediated delivery is an alternative to viral vector-mediated gene delivery. Lipid-mediated delivery of DNA or mRNA is usually more rapid than viral-mediated delivery, offers a larger payload, and has a nearly zero risk of incorporation. Lipid-mediated delivery of DNA or RNA is therefore preferable to viral DNA delivery in those clinical applications that do not require long-term expression for chronic conditions. Delivery of RNA may be preferable to non-viral DNA delivery in some clinical applications, because transit across the nuclear membrane is not necessary and onset of expression with RNA is therefore even faster than with DNA, although both are faster than most viral vectors. Here, we describe techniques for cationic lipid-mediated delivery of nucleic acids encoding reporter genes in a variety of cell lines. We describe optimized formulations and transfection procedures that we previously assessed by bioluminescence and flow cytometry. RNA transfection demonstrates increased efficiency relative to DNA transfection in non-dividing cells. Delivery of mRNA results in onset of expression within 1 h after transfection and a peak in expression 5-7 h after transfection. Duration of expression in eukaryotic cells after mRNA transcript delivery depends on multiple factors, including transcript stability, protein turnover, and cell type. Delivery of DNA results in onset of expression within 5 h after transfection, a peak in expression 24-48 h after transfection, and a return to baseline that can be as long as several weeks after transfection. In vitro results are consistent with our in vivo delivery results, techniques for which are described as well. RNA delivery is suitable for short-term transient gene expression due to its rapid onset, short duration of expression and greater efficiency, particularly in non-dividing cells, while the longer duration and the higher mean levels of expression per cell that are ultimately obtained following DNA delivery confirm a continuing role for DNA gene delivery in clinical applications that require longer term transient gene expression.

Histidinylated lPEI (His-lPEI) exhibits also high transfection efficiency but lower cytotoxicity than lPEI. For the first time, we tested polyfection efficiency of polyplexes comprising both lPEI and His-lPEI. A series of pDNA polyplexes was prepared with mixtures of lPEI and His-lPEI and the amount of each polymer within His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes was determined by flow cytometry. We show that His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes exhibit properties similar to lPEI polyplexes in terms of size, morphology, assembly with pDNA, and polyplex stability while His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes exhibit properties similar to His-lPEI polyplexes in terms of buffering capacity. Compared to polyplexes consisting only of lPEI or His-lPEI, the transfection profile reveals that His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes containing 30% to 57% lPEI strongly increase polyfection efficiency of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and murine, as well as human skeletal muscle cell lines without cytotoxicity. Importantly, improved transfection of human dystrophin deficient skeletal muscle cell lines was obtained. These results indicate that His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes are an improved non-viral vector for efficient transfection of dystrophin deficient skeletal muscle cell lines that should be tested on animals."

Recently, non-viral DNA-based gene therapy has been reported to be a safer and more efficient method of delivering DNA into target cells. We used a non-viral gene transfection reagent to delivery bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Primary BMSCs were isolated from rat femurs and transfected with BMP-2 plasmids. The transfection rate was analyzed using flow cytometry. The concentration of BMP-2 protein was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of osteopontin and osteocalcin were measured to evaluate osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, we designed a critical-size calvarial defect rat model to study new bone regeneration, using Matrigel as a scaffold to carry BMP-2-transfected bone marrow stromal cells into the defect site. New bone formation was assessed by micro-computed tomography, X-ray, immunohistochemical staining and histomophometry. The transfection rate after 72 h was 31.5%. The BMP-2 protein level as well as osteopontin and osteocalcin expressions were higher in the experimental group (transfected with BMP-2) than the control group (transfected with green fluorescent protein, GFP). The in vivo study suggested that bone healing occurred 12 weeks after scaffold implantation. In addition, BMP-2-transfected bone marrow stromal cells provided better osteogenic differentiation than primary bone marrow stromal cells.

Current strategies to improve transfection efficiency are bottlenecked by maintaining the balance between efficient gene encapsulation and on-demand cargo release. Here, we developed a new class of Zn(II)-coordinated micelles, which showed tight small interfering RNA (siRNA) binding and pH-switchable release. The dipicolylamine-modified PEI 1.8k (PD) and dopamine-conjugated cholesterol (Chol-Dopa) assemble into coordinative micelles (Zn-PD/Chol-Dopa) via the coordination of 2,2'-dipicolylamine (DPA) and Dopa through Zn(II) as a bridge. The high phosphate-binding affinity of Zn-DPA enhanced the siRNA packaging and the interaction between cholesterol and cell membranes enhanced cellular uptake. Moreover, the coordination effect weakened in the acidic environment of lyso/endosome, triggering the disassembly of micelles and siRNA release. These properties of the micelles resulted in strong siRNA transfection efficiencies in various cell lines. Our strategy of constructing coordinative micelles improves the transfection efficiency of LMW PEI and holds tremendous potential to develop the endogenous responsive gene delivery systems."

Transient gene expression is particularly well suited for early developmental phases, where several potential therapeutic targets need to be produced and tested in vivo. As a relatively new bioprocessing modality, a number of opportunities exist for improving cell culture productivity upon transient transfection. For instance, several compounds have shown positive effects on transient gene expression. These transfection enhancers either facilitate entry of PEI/DNA transfection complexes into the cell or nucleus or increase levels of gene expression. In this work, the potential of combining transfection enhancers to increase Gag-based virus-like particle production levels upon transfection of suspension-growing HEK 293 cells is evaluated.

DNA was quantitatively injected into a single cell at a desired location and time, and the optimal gene delivery and expression conditions were determined based on the amount of the delivered DNA and the transfection efficacy. Interestingly, an injection of 1500 DNAs produced an about average 30% gene expression efficiency, which was the optimal condition, and gene expression was sustained for more than 14 days.

ChiCas NPs formulation optimization was carried out by analyzing several characteristics such as NP size, zeta potential, and chitosan and casein incorporation efficacy.

We hypothesized that the addition of casein into the nanoparticle's structure would facilitate a proper gene transfer. The work herein presented aimed to optimize the production method of chitosan-casein nanoparticles (ChiCas NPs) and to test their ability as a gene delivery system. ChiCas NPs formulation optimization was carried out by analyzing several characteristics such as NP size, zeta potential, and chitosan and casein incorporation efficacy. The best formulation developed presented small and homogenous particle size (around 335 nm) and positive zeta potential (≈ + 38 mV), and showed to be stable for 34 weeks both, at 4°C and 20°C. The particles were further used to entrap or to adsorb DNA and form NPs-DNA complexes. In vitro transfection studies, carried out in COS-7 cells, suggested a low transfection efficiency of the different NPs:DNA ratios tested, comparatively to the positive control. Nonetheless, we could observe that the complexes with larger sizes presented better transfection results than those with smaller diameters. To conclude, ChiCas NPs have great technological potential since the preparation process is very simple, and the DNA incorporation efficacy is very high and shows to be physically very stable. The NPs:DNA ratio still needs to be optimized with the aim of achieving better transfection results and being able to anticipate a high gene expression on DNA-based vaccination studies."

Although the overall survival rate has been improved by the current therapeutic regime, the presence of resistance has resulted in limited efficacy. In this study, an RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutic regime is proposed with the aim to knockdown the BCR-ABL hybrid oncogene using small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA transfection rates have usually been limited due to the declining contact probability among polyplexes and the non-adherent nature of leukemic cells. Our work aims at addressing this limitation by using a biodegradable charged polyester-based vector (BCPV) as a nanocarrier for the delivery of BCR-ABL-specific siRNA to the suspension culture of a K562 CML cell line. BCR-ABL siRNAs were encapsulated in the BCPVs by electrostatic force. Cell internalization was facilitated by the BCPV and assessed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The regulation of the BCR-ABL level in K562 cells as a result of RNAi was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We observed that BCPV was able to form stable nanoplexes with siRNA molecules, even in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), and successfully assisted in vitro siRNA transfection in the non-adherent K562 cells. As a consequence of downregulation of BCR-ABL, BCPV-siRNA nanoplexes inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. All results were compared with a commercial transfection reagent, Lipofectamine2000™, which served as a positive control. More importantly, this class of non-viral vector exhibits biodegradable features and negligible cytotoxicity, thus providing a versatile platform to deliver siRNA to non-adherent leukemia cells with high transfection efficiency by effectively overcoming extra- and intra-cellular barriers. Due to the excellent in vitro transfection results from BCPV-siRNA, a newly developed biodegradable transfection agent, BCPV, is being probed for transfection performance in an animal model. "

Branched polyethylenimine (bPEI: 25kDa) is one of the most widely studied nonviral vectors, but its clinical application has been limited due to its cytotoxicity and low transfection efficiency in the presence of serum proteins. In this study, we synthesized cationic amphiphilic copolymers, poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-graft-polyethylenimine (PgP), by grafting low molecular weight PLGA (4kDa) to bPEI (25kDa) at approximately a 3:1 ratio as an efficient nonviral vector. We show that PgP micelle is capable of efficiently transfecting plasmid DNA (pDNA) and siRNA in the presence of 10% serum in neuroglioma (C6) cells, neuroblastoma (B35) cells, and primary E8 chick forebrain neurons (CFN) with pDNA transfection efficiencies of 58.8%, 75.1%, and 8.1%, respectively. We also show that PgP provides high-level transgene expression in the rat spinal cord in vivo that is substantially greater than that attained with bPEI. The combination of improved transfection and reduced cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of serum and in vivo transfection of neural cells relative to conventional bPEI suggests that PgP may be a promising nonviral vector for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery for neural regeneration."

From a standpoint of efficiency and cell viability, magnetic nanoparticle-based DNA transfection is a promising gene vectoring technique because it has demonstrated rapid and improved transfection outcomes when compared to alternative non-viral methods. Recently, our research group introduced oscillating magnet arrays that resulted in further improvements to this novel plasmid DNA (pDNA) vectoring technology. Continued improvements to nanomagnetic transfection techniques have focused primarily on magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) functionalization and transfection parameter optimization: cell confluence, growth media, serum starvation, magnet oscillation parameters, etc. Noting that none of these parameters can assist in the nuclear translocation of delivered pDNA following MNP-pDNA complex dissociation in the cell's cytoplasm, inclusion of a cassette feature for pDNA nuclear translocation is theoretically justified. In this study incorporation of a DNA targeting sequence (DTS) feature in the transfecting plasmid improved transfection efficiency in model neurons, presumably from increased nuclear translocation. This observation became most apparent when comparing the response of the dividing SH-SY5Y precursor cell to the non-dividing and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. "

To this end, a group of novel cationic polyamides were synthesized by polycondensation reaction between different di-p-nitrophenyl esters and tertiary amine-containing primary diamines. These linear polyamides have flexible alkylene group (ethylene or propylene), protonable amino group and bioreducible disulfide linkage in the polyamide main chain. The alkylene group and disulfide linkage in these polyamides have a distinct effect on their gene delivery properties including buffering capacity, gene binding ability and intracellular gene release profile. Those cationic polyamides containing disulfide linkage and 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine (BAP) residue exhibited high buffering capacity (endosomal escape ability), high gene binding ability, and intracellular gene release ability, thus inducing fast gene nucleus translocation and robust gene transfection in vitro against different cell lines and rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the transfection efficiencies in vitro were comparable or higher than those of 25 kDa branched polyethylenimine and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection agent as positive controls. These cationic polyamides and their polyplexes were of low cytotoxicity when an optimal transfection efficacy was achieved. In vivo transfection tests showed that bioreducible BAP-based polyamides were applicable for intravenous gene delivery in a mouse model, leading to higher level of transgene expression in the liver as compared to 22 kDa linear polyethylenimine as a positive control.

Translation of these non-viral gene delivery systems requires improvement of transfection efficiency (TE) through fine-tuning of their physicochemical properties such as electric charge and exact ratios of their components. Since high-throughput experimental screening of minute differences in NP compositions is not routinely feasible, we have developed a coarse-grained model to quantitatively study the energetics of the formation of gene delivery complexes with cationic gemini surfactants (G) (m-s-m type) and helper lipids (H) (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and DOPE/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)), in order to use it as a tool to predict effective compositions. The model is based on the polymorphic structural conformational flip of NPs and incorporates the electrostatic, entropic and elastic energies, to predict the formation energy and stability of different polymorphic structures as a function of the electric charge of cationic surfactants and concentration of constituent helper lipids. Our results show that these two factors are intertwined in determining the behavior of gene delivery vectors. Specifically, we show that increasing H/G lowers free energy per DNA base pair and increases the stability of the complex. At pH 7, low H/G and charge ratio (ρ±), where the lamellar structure is favored, the formation free energy per DNA base pair is between 0 and -14kBT. At higher values of H/G (2-3) and ρ±, where HII and cubic structures are formed, the formation free energy drops down to values ≈-50kBT, indicating the stable existence of these polymorphic structures in the NPs. At pH 5, the structural transformation of NPs in the endosomes to the lamellar/HII structure with free energy values of about -40kBT is beneficial for endosomal escape, and correlates with increased transfection efficiency. The theoretical model is supported by transfection data in A7 astrocytes with a panel of 16-3-16 gemini NPs, which validates the mathematical model and supports the hypothesis that the NP polymorphic phase transition increases transfection efficiency."

While focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with gas-filled microbubbles (MBs) has emerged as a noninvasive modality for MR image-guided gene delivery to the brain, it has been used exclusively to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may induce a sterile inflammation response. Here, we introduce an MR image-guided FUS method that elicits endothelial-selective transfection of the cerebral vasculature (i.e., ""sonoselective"" transfection), without opening the BBB. We first determined that activating circulating, cationic plasmid-bearing MBs with pulsed low-pressure (0.1 MPa) 1.1-MHz FUS facilitates sonoselective gene delivery to the endothelium without MRI-detectable disruption of the BBB. The degree of endothelial selectivity varied inversely with the FUS pressure, with higher pressures (i.e., 0.3-MPa and 0.4-MPa FUS) consistently inducing BBB opening and extravascular transfection. Bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the sonoselective low-pressure regimen does not up-regulate inflammatory or immune responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that the transcriptome of sonoselectively transfected brain endothelium was unaffected by the treatment. The approach developed here permits targeted gene delivery to blood vessels and could be used to promote angiogenesis, release endothelial cell-secreted factors to stimulate nerve regrowth, or recruit neural stem cells."

Here, we report the development of branched poly(5-amino-1-pentanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate) (HC32) as a novel gene vector and elucidate how the topological structure affects gene delivery properties. We found that the branched structure has a big impact on gene transfection efficiency resulting in a superior transfection efficiency of HC32 in comparison to C32 with a linear structure. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the branched structure enhanced DNA binding, leading to the formation of toroidal polyplexes with smaller size and higher cationic charge. Importantly, the branched structure offers HC32 a larger chemical space for terminal functionalization (e.g., guanidinylation) to further enhance the transfection. Moreover, the optimized HC32 is capable of transfecting a diverse range of cell types including cells that are known to be difficult to transfect such as stem cells and astrocytes with high efficiency.

But the transfection efficiency remains low due to inability of the pDNA to enter the nucleus. Various methods have been explored to improve the UTMD transfection efficiency, but with little success. In cells, the classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS) peptide is an amino acid sequence that signals proteins that are due for nuclear transport. The present study aimed to investigate whether binding of a cNLS peptide to the pDNA may improve the transfection efficiency of UTMD. Four experimental groups were analyzed: Control group (UTMD + pDNA), group with cNLS (UTMD + pDNA + cNLS), group with mutated NLS (mNLS; UTMD + pDNA + mNLS), and group with cNLS and the nuclear import blocker, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; UTMD + pDNA + cNLS + WGA). The NLS was labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate, whereas pDNA was labeled with Cy3. Different molar ratios were tested for the NLS and pDNA combination in order to achieve optimal binding of the two molecules. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were then transfected using the optimum ultrasonic irradiation parameters and NLS/pDNA molar ratio. At 6 h post‑transfection, the rates of Cy3‑labeled pDNA inside the cells and their nuclei were detected by flow cytometry and laser confocal microscopy, and the cellular vs. nuclear uptake of pDNA was calculated. In order to further evaluate the effect of NLS on UTMD‑mediated gene transfection, the transfection efficiency and relative expression levels of mRNA and protein were detected at 48 h post‑transfection. The results demonstrated that the optimal molar ratio of NLS with pDNA was 104:1. The rates of pDNA successful entry into the cell and nucleus were significantly higher in the cNLS group compared with the control group. The transfection efficiency, and relative expression levels of mRNA and protein from the plasmid were significantly increased in the cNLS group compared with the control group. The mNLS group displayed no significant difference compared with the control group, while the WGA group exhibited significant inhibition in most indicators of transfection efficiency compared to the cNLS group. These results suggest that combining a cNLS peptide with pDNA during UTMD‑mediated transfection significantly improved transfection efficiency. Thus, a cNLS peptide may be an important mediator and a new strategy in enhancing the efficiency of UTMD‑mediated gene transfection."

Therefore, COS-7 cells were cultured on top of multilayer films formed by layer-by-layer dipcoating of these polymers with GFP-encoded pDNA, and the effect of the number of layers and cell seeding density on the transfection efficiency was evaluated. Multilayer films with pCABOL were found to be superior to pCHIS in facilitating transfection, which was attributed to higher incorporation of pDNA and release of the transfection agent. High amounts of transfected cells were obtained on pCABOL films, correlating proportionally over a wide range with seeding density. Optimal transfection efficiency was obtained with pCABOL films composed of 10 bilayers. Further increase in the number of bilayers only marginally increased transfection efficiency. Using the optimal multilayer and cell seeding conditions, pCABOL multilayers were fabricated on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), heparinized PCL (PCL-HEP), and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) disks as examples of common biomedical supports. The multilayers were found to completely mask the properties of the original substrates, with significant improvement in cell adhesion, which is especially pronounced for PCL and PLA disks. With all these substrates, transfection efficiency was found to be in the range of 25-50% transfected cells. The pCABOL/pDNA multilayer films can also conveniently add transfection capability to 3D scaffolds. Significant improvement in cell adhesion was observed after multilayer coating of 3D-plotted fibers of PCL (with and without an additional covalent heparin layer), especially for the PCL scaffold without heparin layer and transfection was observed on both 3D PCL and PCL-HEP scaffolds. These results show that layer-by-layer dip-coating of pCABOL with functional DNA is an easy and inexpensive method to introduce transfection capability to biomaterials of any nature and shape, which can be beneficially used in various biomedical and tissue engineering applications.

However, these cells usually grow in tight clusters and are therefore more difficult to transfect than many other cell lines. We have found that transfection is especially challenging when mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells are cultured in the newly described 2i medium, which is based on two chemical inhibitors of differentiation pathways. In the present study we have performed a side-by-side comparison of commercially available, non-viral transfection reagents with regard to their ability to deliver plasmid DNA and siRNA into adherent and/or trypsinized mES cells cultured in 2i medium, assessing transfection rates, plasmid gene expression, siRNA mediated knockdown of Oct4 and viability. Finally, we present a fast and efficient method for transfection of trypsinized mES cells using the liposomal-based Lipofectamine 2000. With only a five-minute long transfection time we obtained at least 85 % transfected cells with 80 % maintained viability. Moreover, this protocol saves up to a day of experimental time since the cells are in suspension at the time of transfection, which allows for immediately re-plating into the appropriate format. This fast, simplified and highly efficient transfection method will be valuable for both basic research and high-throughput applications."

Previous studies have shown that the use of small molecule drugs could be an efficient method to increase the efficacy of delivery of oligonucleotides by cell-penetrating peptides either as targeting agents that can be used in formulation with the cell-penetrating peptide and its cargo or as cell signaling modulators that facilitates the cellular uptake of the treatment. This study presents two aims. The first aim is the identification of small molecule drugs that would induce a synergic effect on the transfection of splice correcting oligonucleotides assisted by PepFect14. The second aim is to identify the mechanisms behind the effect of small molecule drugs modulation of cell-penetrating peptide assisted transfection of oligonucleotides. Through an optimized, high-throughput luciferase assay for short oligonucleotide delivery using cell-penetrating peptides, and the simultaneous addition of a small molecule drug library, we show that three small molecule drugs (MPEP, VU0357121 and Ciproxifan) induced an increase in the transfection efficacy of PepFect14 in complex with a short single-stranded oligonucleotide in HeLa pLuc705 cells. These three drugs are described in the literature to be highly specific for their respective target receptors. However, none of those receptors are expressed in our cell line, indicating a yet non-described pathway of action for these small molecules. We show that the indicated small molecules, without interfering with the particles formed by PepFect14 and the oligonucleotide, interfere via still unidentified interactions in cell signaling, leading to an up-regulation of endocytosis and a higher efficacy in the delivery of short splice correcting oligonucleotides in complex with PepFect14."

Ex vivo transfection of a pro-survival gene to transplanted cells is a possible solution; however prolonged expression and/or genomic integration of the gene can be cancer promoting. To supply pro-survival protein only when it is needed, we used mRNA transfection, which exhibits transient protein expression profiles without the risk of genomic integration. Ex vivo transfection of mRNA encoding Bcl-2, a pro-survival factor, led to enhanced hepatocyte engraftment in both of normal and diseased mouse liver, effectively supporting liver function in a model of chronic hepatitis. The transplanted hepatocytes maintained their viability and function in the liver for at least one month, though Bcl-2 expression from mRNA was sustained for just a few days. Mechanism analyses suggest that Bcl-2 inhibits Kupffer cell-mediated hepatocyte clearance, which occurs within 2 days after transplantation. Within 2 days, hepatocytes migrated to the liver parenchyma, presumably a suitable place for the hepatocytes to survive without Bcl-2 expression. Thus, the duration of Bcl-2 expression from mRNA was sufficient to achieve prolonged engraftment. Ex vivo mRNA transfection allows supply of pro-survival factors to transplanted cells with minimal safety concerns accompanying prolonged expression, providing an effective platform to improve engraftment efficiency in cell transplantation therapy."

Effective genetic engineering in organoids would bring new insights in organogenesis and carcinogenesis. However, direct 3D transfection on already formed organoids remains challenging. One limitation is that organoids are embedded in extracellular matrix and grow into compact structures that hinder transfection using traditional techniques. To address this issue, we developed an innovative approach for transgene expression in 3D organoids by combining single-cell encapsulation in Matrigel microbeads using a microfluidic device and electroporation. We demonstrate that direct electroporation of encapsulated organoids reaches up to 80% of transfection efficiency. Using this technique and a morphological read-out that recapitulate the different stages of tumor development, we further validate the role of p63 and PTEN as key genes in acinar development in breast and prostate tissues.

Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy was evaluated to simultaneously analyze in a rapid (minutes) and high-throughput mode (using 96-wells microplates), the transfection efficiency, and the effect of the transfection process on the host cell biochemical composition and metabolism. Semi-adherent HEK and adherent AGS cell lines, transfected with the plasmid pVAX-GFP using Lipofectamine, were used as model systems. Good partial least squares (PLS) models were built to estimate the transfection efficiency, either considering each cell line independently (R (2) ≥ 0.92; RMSECV ≤ 2 %) or simultaneously considering both cell lines (R (2) = 0.90; RMSECV = 2 %). Additionally, the effect of the transfection process on the HEK cell biochemical and metabolic features could be evaluated directly from the FT-IR spectra.

Direct reprogramming of endogenous cardiac fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes via the delivery of transcription factor mRNAs has the potential to regenerate cardiac tissue and to treat heart failure. Even though mRNA delivery to cardiac fibroblasts has the therapeutic potential, mRNA transfection in cardiac fibroblasts has been challenging. Herein, we develop an efficient mRNA transfection in cultured mouse cardiac fibroblasts via a polyarginine-fused heart-targeting peptide and lipofectamine complex, termed C-Lipo and demonstrate the partial direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts towards cardiomyocyte cells. C-Lipo enabled the mRNA-induced direct cardiac reprogramming due to its efficient transfection with low toxicity, which allowed for multiple transfections of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) mRNAs for a period of 2 weeks. The induced cardiomyocyte-like cells had α-MHC promoter-driven GFP expression and striated cardiac muscle structure from α-actinin immunohistochemistry. GMT mRNA transfection of cultured mouse cardiac fibroblasts via C-Lipo significantly increased expression of the cardiomyocyte marker genes, Actc1, Actn2, Gja1, Hand2, and Tnnt2, after 2 weeks of transfection. Moreover, this study provides the first direct evidence that the stoichiometry of the GMT reprogramming factors influence the expression of cardiomyocyte marker genes.

Conceivably, off-target effects could have implications upon proteins or processes being studied and understanding the molecular pathways affected would add value to the interpretation of experimental observations subsequent to cell transfection. Here we have used a SILAC-based proteomic approach to study differentially expressed proteins after transfection of HeLa cells with ECFP vector using a commonly employed non-liposome based transfection reagent, Fugene®HD. Whereas the transfection reagent itself mediated minimal effects upon protein expression, 11 proteins were found to be significantly upregulated after transfection, all of which were associated with an interferon type I/II response. The upregulated proteins might potentially inflict major cellular processes such as RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, post-translational protein modification and cell cycle control. The results were validated by western analysis as well as quantitative RT-PCR and this demonstrated that an essentially identical response was induced in HeLa by transfection using an empty pUC18 vector, which does not contain a mammalian virus promoter, as well as a liposome-based transfection reagent, Lipofectamine(TM)2000. Notably, no induction of the interferon response was observed in HEK293 cells, suggesting that these cells might be preferable to HeLa to avoid undesired off-target effects in transfection studies encompassing interferon-signaling and antiviral responses.

This device was evaluated for the in vitro transfection efficiency of a plasmid coding for Green Fluorescent Protein (pEGFP-C1) in adherent and non-adherent cell lines. The transfection efficiency of the device was compared to those observed with lipofection and nucleofection methods. In both adherent and non-adherent cell lines, the sonoporation device allowed high rate of transfection of pEGFP-C1 (40-80%), as determined by flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression, along with a low rate of mortality assessed by propidium iodide staining. The transfection efficiency and toxicity of sonoporation on the non-adherent cell lines Jurkat and K562 were similar to those of nucleofection, while these two cell lines were resistant to transfection by lipofection. Moreover, sonoporation was used to produce three stably transfected human lymphoma and leukemia lines. Significant transfection efficiency was also observed in two fresh samples of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. In conclusion, we developed a user-friendly and cost-effective ultrasound device, well adapted for routine in vitro high-yield transfection experiments and which does not require the use of any transfection reagent or gas micro-bubbles."

A novel strategy for drug delivery to the brain is to transform BCECs into protein factories by genetic modifications leading to secretion of otherwise BBB impermeable proteins into the central nervous system. However, a huge challenge underlying this strategy is to enable transfection of non-mitotic BCECs, taking a non-viral approach. We therefore aimed to study transfection in primary, non-mitotic BCECs cultured with defined BBB properties without disrupting the cells' integrity."

In the present study we described the synthesis and biological evaluation of hybrid of these two natural antioxidants with each other via ammonium di-ethylether linker, Toc-As in gene delivery. Two control cationic lipids N14-As and Toc-NOH are designed in such a way that one is with ascorbic acid moiety and no tocopherol moiety; another is with tocopherol moiety and no ascorbic acid moiety respectively. All the three cationic lipids can form self-assembled aggregates. The antioxidant efficiencies of the three lipids were compared with free ascorbic acid. The cationic lipids (Toc-As, N14-As and Toc-NOH) were formulated individually with a well-known fusogenic co-lipid DOPE and characterization studies such as DNA binding, heparin displacement, size, charge, circular dichroism were performed. The biological characterization studies such as cell viability assay and in vitro transfection studies were carried out with the above formulations in HepG2, Neuro-2a, CHO andHEK-293T cell lines. The three formulations showed their transfection efficiencies with highest in Toc-As, moderate inN14-As and least in Toc-NOH. Interestingly, the transfection efficiency observed with the antioxidant based conjugated lipid Toc-As is found to be approximately two and half fold higher than the commercially available lipofectamine 2000 at 4:1 charge ratio in Hep G2 cell lines. In the other cell lines studied the efficiency of Toc-As is found to be either higher or similarly active compared to lipofectamine 2000. The physicochemical characterization results show that Toc-As lipid is showing maximum antioxidant potency, strong binding with pDNA, least size and optimal zeta potential. It is also found to be least toxic in all the cell lines studied especially in Neuro-2a cell lines when compared to other two lipids. In summary, the designed antioxidant lipid can be exploited as a delivering system for treating ROS related diseases such as malignancy, brain stroke, etc."

This study elucidates a cause of the false positive effect in luciferase assays by using polymer nanoassemblies (PNAs) made from PEG, PEI, poly-(l-lysine) (PLL), palmitate (PAL), and deoxycholate (DOC): PEG-PEI (2P), PEG-PEI-PAL (3P), PEG-PLL (2P'), PEG-PLL-PAL (3P'), and PEG-PEI-DOC (2PD). In vitro transfection and western blot assays of luciferase using a colorectal cancer cell line expressing luciferase (HT29/LUC) concluded that 2P and 2P' caused no luciferase expression reduction while hydrophobically modified PNAs induced a 35-50% reduction (3P'<2PD<3P). Although cell viability remained stagnant, 3P triggered cellular stress responses including increased membrane porosity and decreased ATP and cellular protein concentrations. Raman spectroscopy suggested that hydrophobic groups influence PNA conformation changes, which may have caused over-ubiquitination and degradation of luciferase in the cells. These results indicate that hydrophobically modified PEG-PEI induces cellular distress causing over-ubiquitination of the luciferase protein, producing false positive siRNA transfection in the luciferase assay."

This study was aimed to evaluate chicken egg white nuclease properties and thereof plausibility of devising an in vivo transfection technology without causing physical damage to the embryo. First, the nuclease activity of egg albumen was assessed. The egg white nucleases were strongly active in degrading DNA and RNA. The egg white DNase activity was comparable to commercially available DNase-I. Nuclease activities were also assessed after heating, proteinase K, or EDTA treatment. Unlike proteinase K, both heating and EDTA were noticeably effective for the nuclease inactivation. Simultaneous application of lipoplex form of DNA (1 μg pDB2: 3 μl Lipofectamine2000) and EDTA showed a synergistic effect in protection against egg white nucleases. Finally, we injected the lipoplexes with or without EDTA close to the embryo at day0, but outside the embryonic epiblast. Implementation of a scrutinized PCR assay indicated that transfection took place only when EDTA was complemented to the lipoplexes. The transfection rate of day4 embryos and the hatched chicks were 54.5 and 30.0%, respectively. EGFP expression was detected in two out of three transgenic chicks. In conclusion, this study provided a detail analysis of chicken egg albumen nuclease properties and suggested the feasibility of developing a puncture-free handmade technology for transfection of the chicken embryo."

We report that PTG1 transfection of cells in suspension with a plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein leads to 72 and 97% of transfected CHO and HEK293T cells respectively, and does not significantly affect cell viability. PTG1 transfection of 100 mL of CHO-S cell culture in suspension at a cell density of 2 × 10(6) cells /mL resulted in a high level of transfected cells and protein expression after transfection with 0.75 μg/mL plasmid DNA. Transfection with PTG1 is more efficient than LipofectAmine2000™, and gene expression is higher than observed with FreeStyle™ and JetPEI®. Tri-transfection of HEK293T packaging cells leads to the production of a higher level of r-lentiviral particles compared to the calcium phosphate method, and permits two harvests of viral particles within three days. These results show that PTG1 is a powerful new transfection reagent for cell lines frequently used for recombinant protein and lentiviral particle production. PTG1 could be used in protocols for bioproduction of therapeutic proteins such as antibodies for cancer treatments and viral vectors for gene therapy applications. "

However, little information exists if protein moieties can serve as an important role for internalization and endosome escape ability of the genetic material. To explore this issue, we designed two cationic oligochitosan-modified vectors that consist of different proteins, namely a hydrophobic plant protein (zein) and a hydrophilic animal protein (ovalbumin (OVA)) to deliver pDNA to epithelial cell line CHO-K1 and HEK 293 T. These cationic vectors were systematically characterized by molecular weight, infrared (IR) structural analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphology, and surface charge. A remarkable impact of protein moieties was observed on physiochemical properties of the developed vectors. Oligochitosan-modified zein containing hydrophobic protein exhibited high buffering capacity and excellent DNA binding ability compared to the oligochitosan-modified OVA. The data on transfection in the presence of endocytic inhibitors indicated that the caveolae-mediated pathway (CvME) played a key role in the internalization of the zein-based polyplex. However, the OVA-based polyplex was internalized in CHO-K1 cells via CvME and in HEK 293 T cells via the lipid-mediated pathway. Moreover, oligochitosan-modified zein exhibited lower cytotoxicity, greater lysosomal escape ability, better plasmid stability, and better transfection efficiency than the oligochitosan-modified OVA.

Compared to extrinsic growth factors and molecules, oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation can be more effectively modulated by regulation of the cell transcription network. In the developing central nervous system (CNS), two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Olig1 and Olig2, are decisive in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Olig2 plays a critical role in the specification of oligodendrocytes and Olig1 is crucial in promoting oligodendrocyte maturation. Recently viral vectors have been used to overexpress Olig2 and Olig1 in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) to induce the maturation of oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination activity in vivo. Because of the safety issues with viral vectors, including the insertional mutagenesis and potential tumor formation, non-viral transfection methods are preferred for clinical translation. Here we report a poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE)-based nanoparticle transfection method to deliver Olig1 and Olig2 into human fetal tissue-derived NSCs and demonstrate efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation following transgene expression of Olig1 and Olig2. This approach is potentially translatable for engineering stem cells to treat injured or diseased CNS tissues."

Until recently, production of milligrams to grams of protein in CHO transient systems was challenging. As such, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells are the most common mammalian cell type used for transient transfection. The post-translational modifications (PTMs) of a protein are dictated in part by the cell line used for expression, and changes in PTMs have been shown to affect both the activity and biophysical properties of proteins. Therefore, it is potentially advantageous to keep the host cell type consistent throughout drug discovery and development. To this end, we compared the ExpiCHO system, a high density CHO-S transient transfection system, to the Expi293 and FreeStyle MAX CHO transient systems. Fourteen proteins were expressed in both the Expi293 and ExpiCHO systems. For a majority of proteins tested, the protein titers observed with the ExpiCHO system were higher than those seen with both the FreeStyle MAX CHO and Expi293 systems. Antibodies expressed using the ExpiCHO system had glycosylation patterns more similar to antibodies produced in stable CHO cell lines than Expi293-derived antibodies. However, culture duration and temperature were found to affect protein titer, monodispersity, enzyme activity, and PTMs and should be carefully selected when using the ExpiCHO system. The ExpiCHO transient transfection systems allows for facile production of milligrams to grams of protein in CHO cells and de-risks the transition from transient to stable material during drug development."

In this study, using poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers ended with amine, hydroxyl, or carboxyl as model, we tested the influences of size and surface group as well as cytotoxicity and endocytosis on hESC gene transfection. We found that in culture medium of mTeSR the particle sizes of G5, G7, G4.5COOH, and G5OH were around 5 nm and G1 had a smaller size of 3.14 nm. G5 and G7 had a slight and significant positive zeta potential, respectively, whereas G1 was slightly negative, and G4.5COOH and G5OH were significantly negative. We demonstrated that only amine-terminated dendrimers accomplished gene transfection in hESCs, which is greater than that from Lipofectamine 2000 transfection. Ten micromolar G5 had the greatest efficiency and was better than 1000 μM G1. Only a low concentration (0.5 and 1 μM) of G7 realized gene delivery. Amine-ended dendrimers, especially with higher generations, were detrimental to the growth and pluripotent maintenance of hESCs. In contrast, similarly sized hydroxyl- and carboxyl-terminated dendrimers exerted much lower cytotoxicity, in which carboxyl-terminated dendrimer maintained pluripotency of hESCs. We also confirmed the endocytosis into and significant exocytosis from hESCs using FITC-labeled G5 dendrimer. These results suggested that careful considerations of size, concentration, and zeta potential, particularly the identity and position of groups, as well as minimized exocytosis in the design of a vector for hESC gene delivery are necessary, which helps to better design an effective vector in hESC gene transduction.

In order to further elucidate structure-activity relationships of biodegradable cationic poly(carbonate) gene carriers, we synthesized a series of narrowly dispersed homo-polymers via metal-free organocatalytic living ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonate monomers bearing either alkyl (propyl, hexyl or nonyl) or 4-methyl benzyl halide side chains. The polymers were then quaternized using bis-tertiary amines to install both quaternary ammoniums and tertiary amines for DNA binding and endosomal escape, respectively. Among the polymers with similar molecular lengths and charge densities, it was found that an increase in side chain alkyl spacer length from 3 to 6 carbons significantly enhanced cellular uptake and luciferase gene expression in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines without causing overt hemolysis and cytotoxicity. A further increase of side chain alkyl length to 9 carbons, however, led to a drastic decline in gene expression due to increased cellular toxicity, which was correlated with an increased disruption and lysis of red blood cell membranes. Interestingly, the incorporation of an aromatic 4-methyl benzyl spacer increased DNA binding strength, reduced particle sizes of resultant DNA complexes, and enhanced cellular uptake, leading to improved luciferase gene expression, albeit with higher levels of hemolysis and cytotoxicity. Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that a delicate balance between cationic charge density and hydrophobicity could be achieved by utilizing a hexyl spacer in the side chains of cationic poly(carbonates), hence providing insights on the future development of non-viral cationic polymeric gene delivery systems."

It is very challenging to develop non-viral nanocarriers to achieve ultra-high gene transfection efficiencies. Herein, we report a novel design of ""tight binding-but-detachable"" lipid-nanoparticle composite to achieve ultrahigh gene transfection efficiencies of 60∼82%, approaching the best value (∼90%) obtained using viral vectors. We show that Fe@CNPs nanoparticles coated with LP-2000 lipid molecules can be used as gene carriers to achieve ultra-high (60-80%) gene transfection efficiencies in HeLa, U-87MG, and TRAMP-C1 cells. In contrast, Fe@CNPs having surface-covalently bound N,N,N-trimethyl-N-2-methacryloxyethyl ammonium chloride (TMAEA) oligomers can only achieve low (23-28%) gene transfection efficiencies. Similarly ultrahigh gene transfection/expression was also observed in zebrafish model using lipid-coated Fe@CNPs as gene carriers. Evidences for tight binding and detachability of DNA from lipid-nanoparticle nanocarriers will be presented. "

Polyplexes based on plasmid and linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) transfect healthy lung tissue when applied intravenously (i.v.) in the mouse, but direct delivery into the lungs results in low transfection of lung tissue. Nevertheless, LPEI could offer the potential to transfect lung tumors selectively, if accessible from the alveolar side. This study combined near infrared fluorescent protein 720 (iRFP720) and firefly luciferase as reporter genes for detection of tumor lesions and transfection efficiency of LPEI polyplexes, after intratracheal microspraying in mice bearing 4T1 triple negative breast cancer lung metastases. Simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of iRFP720 and enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in vitro demonstrated the potential to combine these reporter genes within transfection studies. Polyplex biophysics was characterized by single nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to monitor physical integrity after microspraying in vitro. 4T1 cells were transduced with iRFP720-encoding lentivirus and evaluated by flow cytometry for stable iRFP720 expression. Growth of 4T1-iRFP720 cells was monitored in Balb/c mice by tomographic near infrared imaging, tissue and tumor morphology by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

The development of a suitable gene delivery system is imperative to ensure the feasibility and viability of cancer gene therapy in a clinical setting. The conception of delivery systems based on cell- penetrating peptides may deeply contribute for the evolution of therapy efficacy. In this context, the present work explores the p53 encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensation ability of RALA peptide to produce a suitable intracellular delivery platform. These carriers, formed at several nitrogen to phosphate groups (N/P) ratio, were characterized in terms of morphology, size, surface charges, loading and complexation capacity and the fine structure has been analyzed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed intracellular localization of nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced sustained pDNA uptake. Moreover, in vitro transfection of HeLa cells mediated by RALA/pDNA vectors allows for gene release and p53 protein expression. From these progresses, apoptosis in cancer cells has been investigated. It was found that N/P ratio strongly tailors gene transfection efficiency and, thus, it can be fine-tuned for desired degree of both protein expression and apoptosis. The great asset of the proposed system relies precisely on the use of N/P ratio as a tailoring parameter that can not only modulate vector´s properties but also the extent of pDNA delivery, protein expression and, consequently, the efficacy of p53 mediated cancer therapy."

Specifically, SLRI, DMEM, PBS, or NaCl were used as the growth solutions for A549 cells, and OPTI-MEM was used as the PKC-a ASO diluent for transfection. Additionally, SLRI, DMEM, PBS, or NaCl were used as both the growth solutions and diluents for transfection. The cell viability and transfection efficiency were determined. The results demonstrated that when SLRI was used as either the growth solution or both the growth solution and diluent for aprinocarsen transfection in A549 cells, the effects were close to the best effects observed with DMEM as the growth solution and OPTI-MEM as the diluent, which supported the transfection of aprinocarsen into the cells. Moreover, SLRI resulted in higher transfection efficiency than those of PBS and NaCl. In in vitro experiments, aprinocarsen effectively induced apoptosis in A549 cells. In conclusion, SLRI may replace PBS or NaCl in clinical trials as a transfection solution readily accepted by the human body. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the use of SLRI as a transfection solution in lung-cancer cell lines."

In this work we address this problem by constructing biodegradable high MW PEI mimics built from low MW PEI building blocks. The end-groups of small 5-arm star polyethylene glycol (PEG) prepolymers were decorated with linear oligo-ethyleneimine (OEI)/PEI arms of various MW via azomethine linkages. The resultant PEI-PEG-star-copolymers were investigated for their ability to complex plasmid DNA. Polymer/DNA complexes were characterized using techniques such as dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Having established their cytotoxicity limits, they were tested as gene delivery vehicles for the transfection of suspension adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-S) cells under serum-free conditions and adherent human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) in serum containing medium. Our PEI-PEG-star-copolymers showed a reduced cytotoxicity compared to high MW PEI while maintaining the ability to complex plasmid DNA and transfect mammalian cells, with significant transfection efficiencies. The effects of the optimum parameters on the transfection of mammalian cells using such novel polymers are discussed."

In a second one, primary amino and imidazole groups are incorporated also via a copolymerization strategy. In a third one, secondary amino groups are substituted with methylguanidine functions through a postpolymerization reaction.

To better understand the relationship between cellular stress responses and polyplex-mediated transfection, polyplex-induced early autophagy in mouse fibroblasts was characterized and the impact of autophagy modulation on transgene expression evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of double-membraned autophagosome in the cytoplasm of polyplex-transfected cells. Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy revealed intracellular LC3 punctation that was characteristic of early autophagy activation. Elevated expression of autophagosome-associated LC3 II protein was also detected by Western blot. When cells were treated with small-molecule modulators of autophagy, polyplex-mediated gene transfection efficiency was significantly affected. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an early autophagy inhibitor, reduced transfection efficiency, whereas rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, enhanced transgene expression. Importantly, the observed functional impact on gene transfection by autophagy modulation was decoupled from that of other modes of cellular stress response (apoptosis/necrosis). Treatment of cells by 3-MA or rapamycin did not affect the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) but did decrease or increase, respectively, nuclear localization of polyplex-delivered plasmid DNA. These findings suggest new possibilities of enhancing polyplex-mediated gene delivery by codelivery of small-molecule regulators of autophagy. "

The mechanism of transfection is poorly understood, particularly when the gene is appended to a AuNP, as expression of the desired exogenous protein is dependent not only on the efficiency of the gene being taken into the cell but also on efficient endosomal escape and cellular processing of the nucleic acid. Design of a multicolor surface energy transfer (McSET) molecular beacon by independently dye labeling a linearized plasmid and short duplex DNA (sdDNA) appended to a AuNP allows spatiotemporal profiling of the transfection events, providing insight into package uptake, disassembly, and final plasmid expression. Delivery of the AuNP construct encapsulated in Lipofectamine2000 is monitored in Chinese hamster ovary cells using live-cell confocal microscopy. The McSET beacon signals the location and timing of the AuNP release and endosomal escape events for the plasmid and the sdDNA discretely, which are correlated with plasmid transcription by fluorescent protein expression within the cell. It is observed that delivery of the construct leads to endosomal release of the plasmid and sdDNA from the AuNP surface at different rates, prior to endosomal escape. Slow cytosolic diffusion of the nucleic acids is believed to be the limiting step for transfection, impacting the time-dependent expression of protein. The overall protein expression yield is enhanced when delivered on a AuNP, possibly due to better endosomal escape or lower degradation prior to endosomal escape. "

Mean sizes of liposomes were influenced by their lipid composition and the preparation concentration at the time of sonication. Zeta potentials of liposomes were inversely correlated with their liposome sizes. However, neither liposome sizes nor zeta potentials were correlated with transfection efficiency. The optimum composition of liposomes was cell-line dependent (T1P0 and T3P1 for Huh7 and AGS, T3P1 and T1P1 for COS7, and T1P1 and T1P3 for A549). The shape of lipoplexes was changed from lamellar to inverted hexagonal structure according to the increased ratio of DOPE, but there was no definite advantage of specific structure in transfection efficiency throughout all used cell lines. However, cellular internalization was consistently faster in T1P0, T3P1, T1P1 compared to T1P3 in all cell lines, suggesting the importance of endosomal escape. Our findings show that the transfection efficiency of DOTAP liposomes is mainly influenced by lipid composition and cell type, and not by size or zeta potential. "

While the delivery of growth-inhibiting miRNA to multiple myeloma cells would be a promising strategy to evaluate treatment options, most multiple myeloma cells are transfection-resistant with established methods. Nonviral nanoparticulate transfection systems are particularly promising in this context, but so far struggle with transfection and knockdown efficiency. Here, we present poly(glycidol)-based nanogels with covalently bound cell-penetrating peptide TAT (transactivator of transcription from HIV). TAT facilitated a varying internalization efficiency of the nanogels depending on the cell line. The positively charged peptide also served as complexation agent for miRNA and enabled covalent binding of the TAT/miR-34a complex in the nanogels. These TAT/miRNA-loaded nanogels delivered and released miR-34a with high efficiency into OPM-2 multiple myeloma cells that are known as transfection-resistant. Delivery resulted in efficient downregulation of known target genes such as Notch1, Hey1, Hes6, and Hes1. Thus, these nanogel constructs offer a new tool to enhance gene delivery into multiple myeloma cells with immediate value in cancer research."

Pro-BDNF, a gene from human brain cDNA libraries, was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and constructed in a mammalian expression vector (PSecTag2/HygroB). The nanoparticles (NPs) were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, and Transmission electron microscopy. From the results, the levels of BDNF among the transfected and untransfected cells were 30.326 ± 5.9 and 5.85 ± 3.11 pg/mL, respectively, as detected by an ELISA method. Moreover, the enhanced green fluorescent protein vector was used to evaluate the gene expression efficiency for SPIONs-PLL as a non-viral carrier in NSCs. This was performed under the influence of a magnetic field and the transfection reagents (such as Lipofectamine 2000), which served as a positive control. The histological analysis revealed that the concentration of intracellular NPs was significantly higher than intercellular NPs. These results suggest that SPIONs-PLL can serve as a novel alternative for the transfection of BDNF-NSCs and could be used in gene therapy."

However, siRNA delivery into primary cells, especially primary macrophages, is often considered challenging. Here we report the investigation of the suitability of two methodologies: transient transfection and electroporation, to deliver siRNA targeted against the putative immunomodulatory gene Mediterranean fever (MEFV) into primary bovine monocyte-derived macrophages (bMDM). Eleven commercial transfection reagents were investigated with variable results with respect to siRNA uptake, target gene knock-down, cell toxicity and type I interferon (IFN) response induction. Three transfection reagents: Lipofectamine 2000, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and DharmaFECT 3, were found to consistently give the best results. However, all the transfection reagents tested induced an IFN response in the absence of siRNA, which could be minimized by reducing the transfection reagent incubation period. In addition, optimized siRNA delivery into bMDM by electroporation achieved comparable levels of target gene knock-down as transient transfection, without a detectable IFN response, but with higher levels of cell toxicity. The optimized transient transfection and electroporation methodologies may provide a starting point for optimizing siRNA delivery into macrophages derived from other species or other cells considered difficult to investigate with siRNA.

Amongst the most efficient non-viral gene delivery systems are lipopolyplexes, in which cationic peptides are co-formulated with plasmid DNA and lipids. One advantage of lipopolyplex vectors is that they have the potential to be targeted to specific cell types by attaching peptide targeting ligands on the surface, thus increasing both the transfection efficiency and selectivity for disease targets such as cancer cells. In this paper, we have investigated two different modes of displaying cell-specific peptide targeting ligands at the surface of lipopolyplexes. Lipopolyplexes formulated with bimodal peptides, with both receptor binding and DNA condensing sequences, were compared with lipopolyplexes with the peptide targeting ligand directly conjugated to one of the lipids. Three EGFR targeting peptide sequences were studied, together with a range of lipid formulations and maleimide lipid structures. The biophysical properties of the lipopolyplexes and their transfection efficiencies in a basal-like breast cancer cell line were investigated using plasmid DNA bearing genes for the expression of firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. Fluorescence quenching experiments were also used to probe the macromolecular organisation of the peptide and pDNA components of the lipopolyplexes. We demonstrated that both approaches to lipopolyplex targeting give reasonable transfection efficiencies, and the transfection efficiency of each lipopolyplex formulation is highly dependent on the sequence of the targeting peptide. To achieve maximum therapeutic efficiency, different peptide targeting sequences and lipopolyplex architectures should be investigated for each target cell type."

Here, we report unanticipated effects on autophagy and bioenergetics in neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) incubated with the widely used lipid-based transfection reagent lipofectamine (LF), which induced mitochondria depolarization followed by disruption of electron transport. When NPCs were exposed to LF for 5 h followed by 24, 48, and 72 h in LF-free media, an immediate increase in mitochondrial ROS production and nitrotyrosine formation was observed. These events were accompanied by disrupted mitophagy (accumulation of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria, and of LC3II and p62), in an mTOR- and AMPK-independent manner, and despite the increased mitochondrial PINK1 (PTEN-inducible kinase 1) localization. Evidence supported a role for a p53-mediated abrogation of parkin translocation and/or abrogation of membrane fusion between autophagosome and lysosomes.

We conclude that autophagy, an inherent cellular response process, is triggered by the cellular uptake of CPP-based transfection system. This finding opens novel possibilities to use autophagy modifiers in future gene therapy."

However, biocompatibility challenge such as nonspecific interactions with blood cells and serum proteins, may affect the delivery efficiency of cationic vectors; besides, inefficient endosomal escape causes low transfection efficiency. Herein, we synthesized an anionic coating polymer dextran-g-aconic anhydride (Dex-Aco, DA) through a simple esterification reaction, which can protect cationic polymer poly(cystamine-bis-acrylamide)-agmatine-histamine (PCAH, PC) constructed nanomedicine against interactions with blood cells and serum proteins, improving biocompatibility. Interestingly, DA coating significantly increased the transfection efficiency of cationic PC，not due to the increase of cellular uptake, nor functioning as a receptor ligand, but was associated to the change of endocytosis pathway. Finally, using programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) as a functional gene, DA coating PC NPs showed improved therapeutic effect and biocompatibility on tumor bearing mice. We believe that this DA coating PC NPs provides a facile method to improve the performance of cationic polymer vectors in gene therapy and has great potential for clinical applications."

We previously developed Pluronic P123 modified polypropyleneimine (PPI)/pDNA (P123-PPI/pDNA) polyplexes as a gene delivery system. The results showed that P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes revealed higher transfection efficiency than PPI/pDNA polyplexes in multidrug resistant breast cancer cells. As a continued effort, the present investigation on the factors influencing the transfection efficiency, cellular uptake mechanisms, and intracellular fate of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes is reported. The presence of P123 was the main factor influencing the transfection efficiency of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes in MCF-7/ADR cells, but other parameters, such as N/P ratio, FBS concentration, incubation time and temperature were important as well. The endocytic inhibitors against clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME), and macropinocytosis were involved in the internalization to investigate their effects on the cellular uptake and transfection efficiency of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes in vitro. The data showed that the internalization of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes was obtained from both CME and CvME. Colocalization experiments with TRITC-transferrin (CME indicator), Alexa Fluor 555-CTB (CvME indicator), monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (microtubule indicator), and LysoTracker Green (Endosome/lysosome indicator) were carried out to confirm the internalization routes. The results showed that both CME and CvME played vital roles in the effective transfection of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes. Endosome/lysosome system and skeleton, including actin filament and microtubule, were necessary for the transportation after internalization. "

In this study, we confirm the transfection efficiency of reporter DNA to several cancer and normal cell lines after transient transfection by single-cell imaging. Luminescence images could be obtained from living single cells after transient transfection, and the calculated transfection efficiency of this method was similar to that of the conventional reporter assay using a luminometer. We attempted to measure the activity of the Bip promoter under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions using both high and low transfection efficiency cells for plasmid DNA at the single-cell level, and observed activation of this promoter even in cells with the lowest transfection efficiency.

Transfection with siRNA and plasmid DNA is an efficient tool for studying their function, but transfection of macrophages is not a trivial matter. Although many different approaches for transfection of eukaryotic cells are available, only few allow reliable and efficient transfection of macrophages, but reduced cell vitality and severely altered cell behavior like diminished capability for differentiation or polarization are frequently observed. Therefore a transfection protocol is required that is capable of transferring siRNA and plasmid DNA into macrophages without causing serious side-effects thus allowing the investigation of the effect of the siRNA or plasmid in the context of normal cell behavior. The protocol presented here provides a method for reliably and efficiently transfecting human THP-1 macrophages and monocytes with high cell vitality, high transfection efficiency, and minimal effects on cell behavior. This approach is based on Nucleofection and the protocol has been optimized to maintain maximum capability for cell activation after transfection. The protocol is adequate for adherent cells after detachment as well as cells in suspension, and can be used for small to medium sample numbers. Thus, the method presented is useful for investigating gene regulatory effects during macrophage differentiation and polarization. Apart from presenting results characterizing macrophages transfected according to this protocol in comparison to an alternative chemical method, the impact of cell culture medium selection after transfection on cell behavior is also discussed. The presented data indicate the importance of validating the selection for different experimental settings. "

Here, mRNA polyplexes comprising N-substituted polyaspartamides with varied numbers of side chain aminoethylene repeats were constructed, and their transfection ability against human hepatoma cells was examined. Transfection efficacy clearly correlated with the number of aminoethylene repeats: polyplexes with odd number repeats (PA-Os) produced sustained increases in mRNA expression compared with those with even number repeats (PA-Es). This predominant efficacy of PA-Os over PA-Es was contradictory to our previous findings for pDNA polyplexes prepared from the same N-substituted polyaspartamides, that is, PA-Es revealed superior transfection efficacy of pDNA than PA-Os. Intracellular FRET analysis using flow cytometry and polyplex tracking under confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that overall transfection efficacy was determined through the balance between endosomal escaping capability and stability of translocated mRNA in cytoplasm. PA-Es efficiently transported mRNA into the cytoplasm. However, their poor cytoplasmic stability led to facile degradation of mRNA, resulting in a less durable pattern of transfection. Alternatively, PA-Os with limited capability of endosomal escape eventually protect mRNA in the cytoplasm to induce sustainable mRNA expression. Higher cytoplasmic stability of pDNA compared to mRNA may shift the limiting step in transfection from cytoplasmic stability to endosomal escape capacity, thereby giving an opposite odd-even effect in transfection efficacy. Endosomal escaping capability and nuclease stability of polyplexes are correlated with the modulated protonation behavior in aminoethylene repeats responding to pH, appealing the substantial importance of chemistry to design polycation structures for promoted mRNA transfection.

Usually, high molecular weight of PEI means high gene transfection, as well as high cytotoxicity in gene delivery in vivo. In order to enhance the transfection efficiency and reduce the cytotoxicity of PEI-based gene carriers, a novel cationic gene carrier was developed by co-self-assembly of cationic copolymers. First, a star-shaped copolymer poly(3(S)-methyl-morpholine-2,5-dione-co-lactide) (P(MMD-co-LA)) was synthesized using D-sorbitol as an initiator, and the cationic copolymer (P(MMD-co-LA)-g-PEI) was obtained after grafting low-molecular weight PEI. Then, by co-self-assembly of this cationic copolymer and a diblock copolymer methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-b-P(MMD-co-LA), microparticles (MPs) were formed. The core of MPs consisted of a biodegradable block of P(MMD-co-LA), and the shell was formed by mPEG and PEI blocks. Finally, after condensation of pEGFP-ZNF580 by these MPs, the plasmids were protected from enzymatic hydrolysis effectively. The result indicated that pEGFP-ZNF580-loaded MP complexes were suitable for cellular uptake and gene transfection.

The study of DODAB:MO aggregates in the absence of DNA has indicated that their morphology depends on the balance between DODAB's tendency to form bilayer structures and MO's propensity to form inverted non-lamellar structures. Other parameters, such as the temperature have proved to be crucial in the definition of the morphology of the developed nanocarrier. Therefore, in this work, a step forward to the current gene carrier system will be given by studying the effect of the tunable parameters (incubation temperature and MO content) on the structure of pDNA:DODAB:MO lipoplexes. More importantly, the implications that these tunable parameters could have in terms of lipoplex transfection efficiency will be investigated. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta (ζ) potential, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) exclusion were used to assess the formation, structure and destabilization of pDNA:DODAB:MO lipoplexes at DODAB molar fractions of (1:1) and above equimolarity (2:1, 4:1) prepared at incubation temperatures from 25 to 50°C. Experimental results indicate that pDNA:DODAB:MO's structure is sensitive to the lipoplex incubation temperature, resulting in particles of distinct size, superficial charge and structure. These variations are also visible on the complexation dynamics of pDNA, and subsequent release upon incubation with the model proteoglycan heparin (HEP), at 25 and 50°C. Increase in temperature leads to re-organization of DODAB and MO molecules within the liposomal formulation, causing a positive charge re-localization in the lipoplex surface, which not only alters its structure but also its transfection efficiency. Altogether, these results confirm that in the DODAB:MO carriers, an increase in the incubation temperature has a similar effect on aggregate morphology as the observed with an increase in MO content. This conclusion is extended to the pDNA:DODAB:MO lipoplexes morphology and subsequent transfection efficiency defining new strategies in lipoplexes preparation that could be used to modulate the properties of other lipid formulations for nonviral gene delivery applications.

The apoptosis assay showed that the complex could induce a more significant apoptosis to Hela cells than that of curcumin or p53 used alone, and the curcumin loaded micelle inducing apoptosis was best after irradiation. Therefore, CS-g-PZLL is a safe and effective carrier for the codelivery of drug/gene, and curcumin could be used as a photosensitizer to induce a photoenhanced gene transfection, which should be encouraged in improving transfection and tumor therapy."

This work aimed to address these issues. bPEI/DNA and lPEI/DNA, prepared using two different modes of addition of reagents, gave rise to polyplexes with exactly the same chemical composition but differing in dimensions. Upon dilution in serum-free medium, the size of any kind of polyplex promptly rose over time while remained invariably stable in complete DMEM. Of note, the bigger the dimension of polyplexes (in the nano- to micrometer range), the greater their efficiency in vitro. Besides, centrifugal sedimentation of polyplexes displaying different dimensions to speed up and enhance their settling onto cells boosted transfection efficiencies. Conversely, transgene expression was significantly blunted in cells held upside-down and transfected, definitively pointing out the impact of gravitational sedimentation of polyplexes on their transfection efficiency. Overall, much more attention must be paid to the actual polyplex size that relies on the complexation conditions and the transfection medium."

Three of them, Lipid 1, 3 and 5 possessed cationic Me3N(+) moiety at the distal end. In contrast each of the other three Lipid 2, 4 and 6 possessed sigma receptor targeting anisamide group with no cationic charge. Mixing of cationic and anisamide counterparts of the same lipid in a molar ratio of 1:1 produced co-liposomes L-M-1 (Lipid 1+2), L-M-2 (Lipid 3+4) and L-M-3 (Lipid 5+6). These co-liposomes, while keeping the sigma targeting anisamide tag intact, showed good DNA binding and release which were optimized from EB intercalation and gel electrophoresis assays. Inclusion of a zwitterionic, fusogenic natural lipid, DOPE, into the co-liposomes further improved the binding efficiencies of the lipid mixtures with DNA. These co-liposomes having cationic and anisamide lipids and DOPE were highly selective toward sigma positive HEK293 and HEK293T cells compared to the sigma negative HeLa cells. As evidenced from both FACS and luciferase assay, a lipid mixture comprising Lipid 3, 4 and DOPE in a molar ratio of 1:1:1 (L-M-2D1) was the best for transfection of reporter pEGFP-C3 and functional pCEP4-p53 gene plasmids. Anisamide mediated sigma receptor selectivity was further probed by pre-incubating the transfecting cells with lipids possessing anisamide and by quantification of the un-transfected plasmid DNA.

These modifications were designed to improve the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of the polymer, by enhancing the buffering capacity and maintaining low cytotoxic effects of the final conjugate. Decreased expression of CD200 in the central nervous system has been considered as one of the proposed mechanisms associated with neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis; therefore, we selected plasmid-encoding CD200 gene for transfection using the modified PEI derivatives. Dynamic light scattering experiments demonstrated that the modified PEIs were able to condense plasmid DNA and form polyplexes with a size of approximately 130 nm. The highest level of CD200 expression was achieved at a carrier to plasmid ratio of 8, where the expression level was increased by 1.5 fold in the SH-SY5Y cell line, an in vitro model of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the results of in vivo imaging of the LMW PEI-based nanoparticles in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis revealed that fluorescently labeled plasmid encoding CD200 was distributed from the injection site to various tissues and organs including lymph nodes, liver, brain, and finally, kidneys. The nanoparticles also showed the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the periventricular area."

The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of HBx on the cycle progression of primary renal tubular epithelial cells. Primary renal tubular epithelial cells of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were separated and cultured. The morphology of cultured cells was characterized by immunohistochemical analysis and the results demonstrated that primary renal tubular epithelial cells with the expected morphology and distribution were successfully separated and cultured from SD rats. HBx gene pcDNA3.1/myc vector and empty vector were constructed and transfected into cells as HBx and empty groups, respectively. Following transfection, the mRNA and protein levels of HBx, cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E in cells were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The results demonstrated that following HBx gene transfection, the mRNA and protein levels of HBx, cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E in cells were significantly upregulated, compared with the empty control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, cell apoptosis and the cell cycle were evaluated by Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. HBx gene transfection significantly inhibited the cell apoptosis (P<0.05), promoted cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and arrested the cell cycle in the S phase. Therefore, the results of the present study indicated that HBx gene transfection may regulate the apoptosis and cell cycle of primary renal tubular epithelial cells by affecting the expression of cyclins. The results of the present study may improve the understanding of pathogenesis associated with HBV‑associated glomerulonephritis, and may also provide insight and theoretical support for the future design and development of drugs for the treatment of hepatitis B virus."

The gene delivery can enhance the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (ECs), which is beneficial for rapid endothelialization. REDV-G-TAT-G-NLS-Cys (abbreviated as TP-G) peptide could weakly condense pEGFP-ZNF580 (pZNF580) and transfect ECs, but its transfection efficiency was still very low because of its low positive charge, low stability and weak endosome escape ability. In order to develop more stable and efficient gene carriers with low cytotoxicity, in the present study, we conjugated different amounts of TP-G peptide onto poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-g-polyethylenimine (PLGA-g-PEI) amphiphilic copolymers via a hetero-poly(ethylene glycol) spacer (OPSS-PEG-NHS). The TP-G peptide and PEI could cooperatively and strongly condense pZNF580. The carrier's cytotoxicity was reduced by the introduction of poly(ethylene glycol) spacer. They condensed pZNF580 to form gene complexes (PPP-TP-G/pZNF580) with suitable size and positive zeta potential for gene delivery. The transfected ECs promoted their migration ability as demonstrated by cell migration assay. The results of cellular uptake and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed significantly high internalization efficiency, endosomal/lysosomal escape and nucleus location of pZNF580 by this multifunctional TP-G peptide sequence conjugated gene delivery system. Furthermore, several inhibitors were used to study the cellular uptake pathways of PPP-TP-G/pZNF580 complexes. The results showed that PPP-TP-G2/Cy5-oligonucleotide complexes exhibited the optimized endocytosis pathways which facilitated for cellular uptake. In conclusion, the multifunctional TP-G peptide conjugated gene carriers could promote the transfection efficiency due to the multifunction of REDV, cell-penetrating peptide and nuclear localization signal in the peptide sequence, which could be a suitable gene carrier for endothelialization."

These proteins could be used for an assortment of studies including proof of concept, antibody development, and biological structure and function. Here we describe such a platform: a semi-automated process for PEI-mediated transient protein production in tubespins at a throughput of 96 transfections at a time using a Biomek FX(P) liquid handling system. In one batch, 96 different proteins can be produced in milligram amounts by PEI transfection of HEK293 cells cultured in 50 mL tubespins. Methods were developed for the liquid handling system to automate the different processes associated with transient transfections such as initial cell seeding, DNA:PEI complex activation and DNA:PEI complex addition to the cells. Increasing DNA:PEI complex incubation time resulted in lower protein expression. To minimize protein production variability, the methods were further optimized to achieve consistent cell seeding, control the DNA:PEI incubation time and prevent cross-contamination among different tubespins. This semi-automated transfection process was applied to express 520 variants of a human IgG1 (hu IgG1) antibody."

Through this method, ion channels can be investigated through electrophysiological analysis, biochemical characterization, mutational studies, and their effects on cellular processes. Transient transfections offer a simple protocol in which the protein becomes available for analysis within a few hours to days. Although this method presents a relatively straightforward and time efficient protocol, one of the critical components is calibrating the expression of the gene of interest to physiological relevant levels or levels that are suitable for analysis. To this end, many different approaches that offer the ability to control the expression of the gene of interest have emerged. Several stable cell transfection protocols provide a way to permanently introduce a gene of interest into the cellular genome under the regulation of a tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation. While this technique produces reliable expression levels, each gene of interest requires a few weeks of skilled work including calibration of a killing curve, selection of cell colonies, and overall more resources. Here we present a protocol that uses transient transfection of the Transient Receptor Potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) gene in an inducible system as an efficient way to express a protein in a controlled manner which is essential in ion channel analysis. We demonstrate that using this technique, we are able to perform calcium imaging, whole cell, and single channel analysis with controlled channel levels required for each type of data collection with a single transfection. Overall, this provides a replicable technique that can be used to study ion channels structure and function."

All of them compact pEGFP-C3 plasmid DNA and promote transfection in HeLa and MCF-7 cells, both in absence and in presence of human serum. The electrochemical and structural characteristics of the paCD-pDNA complexes (CDplexes) have been studied by using zeta potential, DLS, SAXS, and cryo-TEM. paCDs and pDNA, when assembled in CDplexes, render effective charges that are lower than the nominal ones. The CDplexes show a self-assembling pattern corresponding to multilamellar lyotropic liquid crystal phases, characterized by a lamellar stacking of bilayers of the CD-based vectors with anionic pDNA sandwiched among them. When exposed to human serum, either in the absence or in the presence of pDNA, the surface of the cationic CD-based vector becomes coated by a protein corona (PC) whose composition has been analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Some of the CDplexes herein studied showed moderate-to-high transfection levels in HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells combined with moderate-to-high cell viabilities, as determined by FACS and MTT reduction assays.

Sequence data of the entire T. parva genome are available and in vitro infected cell lines can easily be generated, thereby eliminating the use of animals in the evaluation of the evolution of the transfected sporozoites. Here we report, for the first time, on experiments towards successful transient transfection of T. parva sporozoites, making use of a new generation transfection device. Plasmid DNA containing the strong EF-1α promoter and an Azami Green reporter gene were integrated by nucleofection into freshly purified T. parva sporozoites. Expression of Azami Green was detected with a fluorescence microscope and confirmed by counter staining with a monoclonal directed against a sporozoite protein.

To solve this problem, a new non-viral gene vector was designed. First, a degradable polyethylenimine (PEI) derivate was synthesized by crosslinking low-molecular-weight (LMW) PEI with N-octyl-N-quaternary chitosan (OTMCS), and then adopting a designed trifunctional peptide (RGDC-TAT-NLS) with good tumor targeting, cell uptake and nucleus transport capabilities to modify OTMCS-PEI. The new gene vector was termed as OTMCS-PEI-R18 and characterized in terms of its chemical structure and biophysical parameters. Gene transfection efficiency and nucleus transport mechanism of this vector were also evaluated. The polymer showed controlled degradation and remarkable buffer capabilities with the particle size around 100-300 nm and the zeta potential ranged from 5 mV to 40 mV. Agraose gel electrophoresis showed that OTMCS-PEI-R18 could effectively condensed plasmid DNA at a ratio of 1.0. Besides, the polymer was stable in the presence of sodium heparin and could resist digestion by DNase I at a concentration of 63U DNase I/DNA. OTMCS-PEI-R18 also showed much lower cytotoxicity and better transfection rates compared to polymers OTMCS-PEI-R13, OTMCS-PEI and PEI 25 KDa in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, OTMCS-PEI-R18/DNA complexes could accumulate in the nucleus well soon and not rely on mitosis absolutely due to the newly incorporated ligand peptide NLS with the specific nuclear delivery pathway indicating that the gene delivery system OTMCS-PEI-R18 could reinforce gene transfection efficiency in vivo."

However, few studies have explored how the conjugated hydrophobic groups influence the properties of the modified LMW PEI mainly due to difficulties in obtaining well defined final product compositions and limitations in current chemical synthesis routes. The aim of this study was to modify LMW PEI (Mn 1.8 kDa, PEI-1.8) judiciously with different hydrophobic functional groups and to investigate how hydrophobicity, molecular structure and inclusion of hydrogen bonding properties in the conjugated side groups as well as the conjugation degree (number of primary amine groups of PEI-1.8 modified with hydrophobic groups) influence PEI-1.8 gene transfection efficiency. The modified polymers were characterized for DNA binding ability, particle size, zeta potential, in vitro gene transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity in SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer and HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell lines. The study shows that modified PEI-1.8 polymers are able to condense plasmid DNA into cationic nanoparticles, of sizes ~100 nm, whereas unmodified polymer/DNA complexes display larger particle sizes of 2 μm. Hydrophobic modification also increases the zeta potential of polymer/DNA complexes. Importantly, modified PEI-1.8 shows enhanced transfection efficiency over the unmodified counterpart. Higher transfection efficiency is obtained when PEI-1.8 is modified with shorter hydrophobic groups (MTC-ethyl) as opposed to longer ones (MTC-octyl and MTC-deodecyl). An aromatic structured functional group (MTC-benzyl) also enhances transfection efficiency more than an alkyl functional group (MTC-octyl). An added hydrogen-bonding urea group in the conjugated functional group (MTC-urea) does not enhance transfection efficiency over one without urea (MTC-benzyl). The study also demonstrates that modification degree greatly influences gene transfection, and ~100% substitution of primary amine groups leads to significantly lower gene transfection efficiency. These findings provide insights to modification of PEI for development of effective and non-cytotoxic non-viral vectors."

All cationic polymers show lower cytotoxicity than those of branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI). PSI and bPEI-based polyplexes have comparable physicochemical properties such as size and charge. Interestingly, a strong interaction between dodecylated polycations and pDNA caused by the hydrophobic moiety is observed in dodecylated PSI derivatives. Moreover, the decrease of GFP expression is associated with lower dissociation of pDNA from polyplexes according to the heparin displacement assay. Besides, a hydrophobization of PSI cationic derivatives with dodecyl side chains can modulate the integrity of polyplexes by hydrophobic interactions, increasing the binding between the polymer and the DNA. These results provide useful information for designing polyplexes with lower toxicity and greater stability and transfection performance."

To investigate cellular responses to the influence of graphene and laser irradiation, here we present for the first time a study of mES cell fs laser transfection on graphene coated substrates. First we studied the impact of graphene on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cell viability and cell cytotoxicity in the absence of laser exposure. These were tested via evaluating the mitochondrial activity through adenosine triphosphates (ATP) luminescence and breakages on the cell plasma membrane assessed using cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) screening. Secondly, the effects of fs laser irradiation on cell viability and cytotoxicity at 1064 and 532 nm for cells plated and grown on graphene and pure glass were assessed. Finally, optical transfection of CHO-K1 and mES cells was performed on graphene coated versus plain glass substrates. Our results show graphene stimulated cell viability whilst triggering a mild release of intracellular LDH. We also observed that compared to pure glass substrates; laser irradiation at 1064 nm on graphene plates was less cytotoxic. Finally, in mES cells efficient optical transfection at 1064 (82%) and 532 (25%) nm was obtained due to the presence of a graphene support as compared to pristine glass.

The results revealed that DharmaFECT, but not Lipofectamine, markedly inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis by approximately 70%. Cell viability was not significantly altered. These findings suggest that caution is required in the choice of certain lipid-based transfection reagents for gene silencing experiments, particularly when assessing cholesterol metabolism. "

Such a short incubation time for lipid-based DNA nanoparticles (lipoplexes) reduces cytotoxicity and at the same time reduces the processing time for cells to be transplanted. The encapsulated human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSCs) transfected with BMP-2 plasmid demonstrated high expression of an osteogenic transcription factor, namely RUNX2, but not the chondrogenic factor (SOX9), within the first three days. This activation was also reflected in the 7-day and 21-day experiment, which clearly indicated the induction of osteogenesis but not chondrogenesis.

However, improvement of its efficiency has largely relied on empirical approaches without consistent and translatable results. The goal of this study is to develop a rational strategy based on new results obtained using novel experimental techniques and analysis to improve sonoporation gene transfection. In this study, we conducted experiments using targeted microbubbles that were attached to cell membrane to facilitate sonoporation. We quantified the dynamic activities of microbubbles exposed to pulsed ultrasound and the resulting sonoporation outcome, and identified distinct regimes of characteristic microbubble behaviors: stable cavitation, coalescence and translation, and inertial cavitation. We found that inertial cavitation generated the highest rate of membrane poration. By establishing direct correlation of ultrasound-induced bubble activities with intracellular uptake and pore size, we designed a ramped pulse exposure scheme for optimizing microbubble excitation to improve sonoporation gene transfection. We implemented a novel sonoporation gene transfection system using an aqueous two phase system (ATPS) for efficient use of reagents and high throughput operation. Using plasmids coding for the green fluorescence protein (GFP), we achieved a sonoporation transfection efficiency in rate aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) of 6.9%±2.2% (n=9), comparable with lipofection (7.5%±0.8%, n=9). Our results reveal characteristic microbubble behaviors responsible for sonoporation and demonstrated a rational strategy to improve sonoporation gene transfection. "

Then the effects of particle size and shape of these five different carriers on gene transfection were investigated. The morphology of silica nanoparticles is demonstrated to play an important role in gene transfection, especially when the amount of polycation is low. Chiral nanorods with larger aspect ratio were found to fabricate the most efficient gene carriers with compromised cytotoxicity.

Herein, we evaluated the TE of polymer- and lipid-based nanoplexes (polyplexes, lipoplexes and lipopolyplexes) of EGFP-encoding mRNA and pDNA. To determine the translation and transcription efficiency of each nucleic acid nanoplex, in vitro expression was measured in HEK293T7 cells that permit gene expression in the cytoplasmic region. Globally, mRNA transfection profile was well corroborative with cytoplasmic transfection of pT7-pDNA as well as with nuclear transfection of pCMV-DNA. Irrespective of the nucleic acid, high TE was observed with histidinylated l-polyethylenimine (His-lPEI) polyplexes and dioleyl succinyl paromomycin/O,O-dioleyl-N-histamine phosphoramidate (DOPS/MM27) lipoplexes. Moreover, His-lPEI polyplexes yielded higher in vitro expression of EGFP for pDNA than for mRNA. Furthermore, a significant enhancement in the TE in the presence of an excess of His-lPEI was observed indicating that this polymer promotes cytosolic delivery. Compared to other nanoplexes, His-lPEI polyplex showed high intracellular availability of DNA and mRNA along with low cytotoxicity, owing to its rapid (complete or partial) unpacking in the cytosol and/or endosomes. This study gives an insight that, whether with mRNA or pDNA, enhancing nanoplex unpacking in the endosomes and cytosol would improve the delivery of nucleic acid in the cytosol and particularly in the case of pDNA where a sufficient available amount of pDNA in the cytoplasm would definitely improve its transport toward the nucleus."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-206 on its several target genes in various human tumorous and normal cell lines. In the current work, we created miR-206-overexpressing cell lines (HT-1080, Caco2, iASC, and SS-iASC) using permanent transfection. mRNA expression of the target genes of miR-206 (SMARCB1, ACTL6A, CCND1, POLA1, NOTCH3, MET, and G6PD) and SMARCB1 protein expression were examined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. MiRNA inhibition was used to validate our results. We found a diverse silencing effect of miR-206 on its target genes. While an overall tendency of downregulation was noted, expression profiles of individual cell lines showed large variability. Only CCND1 and MET were consistently downregulated. MiR-206 had an antiproliferative effect on a normal human fibroblast cell line. A strong silencing effect of SMARCB1 in miR-206 transfected SS-iASC was most likely caused by the synergic influence of the SS18-SSX1 fusion protein and miR-206. In the same cell line, a moderate decrease of SMARCB1 protein expression could be observed with immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. In the most comprehensive analysis of miR-206 effects so far, a modest but significant downregulation of miR-206 targets on the mRNA level was confirmed across all cell lines. However, the variability of the effect shows that the action of this miRNA is largely cell context-dependent. Our results also support the conception that the oncomiR effect of miR-206 on SMARCB1 plays an important but not exclusive role in SMARCB1 immunonegative soft tissue sarcomas so it can be considered important in planning the targeted therapy of these tumors in the future. Impact statement Mir-206 is a very unique microRNA because it can act as a suppressor miRNA or as an oncomiRNA depending on the tumor tissue. In SMARCB1 negative soft tissue sarcomas miR-206 is overexpressed, so thus in epithelioid and synovial sarcomas it functions as an oncomiRNA. MiR-206 has diverse silencing effects on its target genes. We found that the action of miR-206 is largely cell context dependent. The oncomiR role of miR-206 is crucial but not exclusive in SMARCB1 negative soft tissue sarcomas and miR-206 has an antiproliferative effect on a normal human fibroblast cell line. Expressions of miR-206 targets observed in tumors can only be reproduced in the corresponding tumorous cell lines. This is the first study which examined the permanent effect of miR-206 on its target genes in normal, tumor, and genetically engineered cell lines."

Bacteriophage (phage)-based viral vectors have the potential to be utilized for general gene transfer applications within research and industry. Yet, they require adaptations in order to enable them to efficiently enter cells and overcome mammalian cellular barriers, as they infect bacteria only; furthermore, limited progress has been made at increasing their efficiency. The production of a novel hybrid nanocomplex system consisting of two different nanomaterial systems, phage vectors and conventional transfection reagents, could overcome these limitations. Here we demonstrate that the combination of cationic lipids, cationic polymers or calcium phosphate with M13 bacteriophage-derived vectors, engineered to carry a mammalian transgene cassette, resulted in increased cellular attachment, entry and improved transgene expression in human cells. Moreover, addition of a targeting ligand into the nanocomplex system, through genetic engineering of the phage capsid further increased gene expression and was effective in a stable cell line generation application. Overall, this new hybrid nanocomplex system (i) provides enhanced phage-mediated gene transfer; (ii) is applicable for laboratory transfection processes and (iii) shows promise within industry for large-scale gene transfer applications.

A properly-engineered array of nanochannels, capable of handling/transfecting ~60 000 cells cm(-2), was fabricated using cleanroom technologies. Positive dielectrophoresis was used to selectively position cells on the nanochannels, thus allowing highly efficient transfection. Single-cell dosage control was demonstrated using both small and large molecules, and different cell types. The potential clinical relevance of this system was tested with difficult-to-transfect natural killer cell suspensions, and plasmids encoding for the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), a model of high relevance for adoptive immunotherapy. Our results show significantly higher CAR transfection efficiencies for the DEP-NEP system (>70% vs. <30%), as well as enhanced cell viabilities. "

Cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane barriers reduce delivery efficiency by impeding the transfection of foreign genes. Thus, a gene delivery system capable of transporting exogenous genes may improve gene therapy. The present study used a novel strategy involving ultrasound‑targeted microbubbles and peptide nucleic acid (PNA)‑binding nuclear localization signals (NLS). Ultrasound‑targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) and PNA‑binding NLS were used to improve the cytoplasmic and nuclear importation of the plasmid, respectively. Experiments were performed using antibody‑targeted microbubbles (AT‑MCB) that specifically recognize the SV40T antigen receptor expressed on the membranes of 293T cells, resulting in the localization of ultrasound microbubbles to 293T cell membranes. Furthermore, PNA containing NLS was inserted into the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)‑N3 plasmid DNA (NLS‑PNA‑DNA), which increased nuclear localization. The nuclear import and gene expression efficiency of the AT‑MCB with PNA‑binding NLS were compared with AT‑MCB alone or a PNA‑binding NLS. The effect of the AT‑MCB containing PNA‑binding NLS on transfection was investigated. The ultrasound and AT‑MCB delivery significantly enhanced the cytoplasmic intake of exogenous genes and maintained high cell viability. The nuclear import and gene expression of combined microbubble‑ and PNA‑transfected cells were significantly greater compared with cells that were transfected with AT‑MCB or DNA with only PNA‑binding NLS. The quantity of EGFP‑N3 plasmids in the nuclei was increased by >5.0‑fold compared with control microbubbles (CMCB) and NLS‑free plasmids. The gene expression was ~1.7‑fold greater compared with NLS‑free plasmids and 1.3‑fold greater compared with control microbubbles. In conclusion, UTMD combined with AT‑MCB and a PNA‑binding NLS plasmid significantly improved transfection efficiency by increasing cytoplasmic and nuclear DNA import. This method is a promising strategy for the noninvasive and effective delivery of target genes or drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."

Human intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus cells were cultured in vitro and subcultured for 5 generations. Using rAAV-BMP-7 and rAAV-SOX9 AAV2-type AAV viruses, the cells were divided into 4 groups: blank normal, BMP-7 transfection, SOX9 transfection, and BMP-7 and SOX9 co-transfection. After 48 h, expression of type II collagen and its mRNA in nucleus pulposus cells was determined. The expression of type II collagen in BMP-7 transfection, SOX9 transfection, and co-transfection groups was up-regulated to varying degrees compared to the blank control group. The type II collagen mRNA level expression in the co-transfection group was significantly higher than in other groups (P < 0.05).

However, the excessive apoptosis of disc cells plays an important role in IVD degeneration, particularly in the nucleus pulposus (NP). Thus, anti-apoptotic gene therapy to attenuate or reverse the degenerative process within the NP is being developed. Survivin is a unique inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and has been extensively investigated in cancer cells. However, little is known of the effects of survivin transfection on NP cells derived from degenerative human disc. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of lentivirus (LV)‑mediated survivin transfection on the morphology and apoptosis of NP cells derived from degenerative human disc in vitro. NP cells were transfected with LV‑mediated survivin. Subsequently, cell morphology was observed and the survivin mRNA expression levels were measured by RT‑qPCR. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and by measuring caspase‑3 activity. The results revealed that the morphology of the NP cells derived from degenerative human disc transfected with LV‑mediated survivin was significantly altered as evidenced by cytomorphosis, the reduction of the cytoplasm and cell shrinkage. Following transfection, survivin gene expression significantly increased in the transfected cells and subsequent generation cells; however, no significant differences in the cell apoptotic rate and caspase‑3 activity were observed. We found that transfection of the survivin gene into NP cells led to the stable expression of survivin and induced marked changes in cell morphology. Furthermore, no significant anti-apoptotic effects were observed following LV‑mediated survivin transfection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LV carrying surviving may be used to successfully enforce the expression of survivin in NP cells. However, cell morphology was evidently altered, whereas the apoptotic rate did not decrease. Comprehensive studies on the feasibility of using survivin in gene therapy in an aim to attenuate disc degeneration are warranted. Further research on the mechanisms responsible for the changes in cell morphology and cell function are also required."

Hoechst 33342 staining was adopted to detect the morphological changes in death gastric cancer cells. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents were measured by DCFH-DA staining. Outcomes demonstrated that the nano-AE has good properties as gene delivery carriers as well as a PS. The group in which the recombinant plasmid of r-caspase-3 was transfected had higher protein expression of the caspase-3 than controls, meanwhile the proliferation rates of the transfected cells were inhibited by the nano-AE-mediated PDT in an energy-dependent manner. In addition, in the transfected cells, the death rate increased to 77.3% as assessed 12 h after PDT (6.4 J/cm(2) ). Hochest 33342 staining also revealed that the death rate increased significantly in the transfected group compared with other groups. Compared to control groups, the production of ROS in nano-AE PDT group had quadrupled in SGC-7901 cells as early as 1 h after PDT, while it is similar to the group of nano-AE transfection and PDT.

Here, ADV is used to control the release of lipoplex-containing plasmid DNA encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter-from a sonosensitive emulsion. Focused ultrasound (3.5 MHz, mechanical index (MI) ≥ 1.5) generates robust release of fluorescein (i.e., surrogate payload) and lipoplex from the emulsion. In situ release of the lipoplex from the emulsion using ADV (MI = 1.5, 30 cycles) yields a 55% release efficiency, resulting in 43% transfection efficiency and 95% viability with C3H/10T1/2 cells. Without exposure to ultrasound, the release and transfection efficiencies are 5% and 7%, respectively, with 99% viability. Lipoplex released by ADV retains its bioactivity while the ADV process does not yield any measureable sonoporative enhancement of transfection. Co-encapsulation of Ficoll PM 400 within the lipoplex-loaded emulsion, and its subsequent release using ADV, yield higher transfection efficiency than the lipoplex alone.

We hypothesized that changes in expression of ion transport proteins have occurred following AQP1 transfection. We use a mathematical model of ion and fluid transport across the parotid duct epithelial cells to predict the expression profile of ion transporters that are consistent with the experimental measurements of saliva composition and secretion rates. Using a baseline set of parameters, the model reproduces the data for the irradiated, non-AQP1-transfected case. We propose three scenarios which may have occurred after transfection, which differ in the location of the AQP1 gene. The first scenario places AQP1 within nonsecretory cells, and requires that epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression is greatly reduced (1.3% of baseline), and ductal bicarbonate concentration is increased from 40.6 to 137.0 mM, to drive water secretion into the duct. The second scenario introduces the AQP1 gene into all ductal cells. The final scenario has AQP1 primarily in the proximal duct cells which secrete water under baseline conditions. We find the change in the remaining cells includes a 95.8% reduction in ENaC expression, enabling us to reproduce all experimental ionic concentrations within 9 mM.

To date, two stable transfection systems have been developed for B. bovis, using selectable markers blasticidin-S deaminase (bsd) or human dihydrofolate reductase (hdhfr). In this work, we combine these two selectable markers in a sequential transfection system. Specifically, a parent transgenic B. bovis line which episomally expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR), was transfected with a plasmid encoding a fusion protein consisting of red fluorescent protein (RFP) and blasticidin-S deaminase (BSD). Selection with WR99210 and blasticidin-S resulted in the emergence of parasites double positive for GFP and RFP. We then applied this method to complement gene function in a parasite line in which thioredoxin peroxidase-1 (Bbtpx-1) gene was knocked out using hDHFR as a selectable marker. A plasmid was constructed harboring both RFP-BSD and Bbtpx-1 expression cassettes, and transfected into a Bbtpx-1 knockout (KO) parasite. Transfectants were independently obtained by two transfection methods, episomal transfection and genome integration. Complementation of Bbtpx-1 resulted in full recovery of resistance to nitrosative stress, via the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside, which was impaired in the Bbtpx-1 KO parasites. In conclusion, we developed a sequential transfection method in B. bovis and subsequently applied this technique in a gene complementation study. This method will enable broader genetic manipulation of Babesia toward enhancing our understanding of the biology of this parasite. "

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed morphological changes, and the effects of BCL2 transfection on cell proliferation were analyzed by cell counting and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The plasmid pcDNA3-BCL2 was identified by restriction enzyme digestion. Different degrees of BCL2 gene expression were detected in all seven clones. BCL2 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm and the nuclear membrane. There were significantly more S-phase cells in the transfection group than in the controls. The morphology did not change after H&E staining. Cell growth was faster than in the controls after transfection for 6 days. At 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, the A values were 4.15 ± 0.31, 5.98 ± 0.56, and 8.94 ± 0.79; those of the controls were 3.01 ± 0.20, 4.76 ± 0.52, and 7.69 ± 0.84; there was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). BCL2 transfection increased GES-1 cells in the S phase; the GES-1 cells were stable and BCL2 expression was high, which promoted cell proliferation."

An adenovirus plasmid encoding the rabbit IHH gene was constructed in vitro and transfected into rabbit BMSCs. Two large groups were used: conventional cell culture and induction model group and simulated microgravity environment group. Each large group was further divided into blank control group, GFP transfection group, and IHH transfection group. During differentiation induction, the expression levels of cartilage-related and cartilage hypertrophy-related genes and proteins in each group were determined. In the conventional model, the IHH transfection group expressed high levels of cartilage-related factors (Coll2 and ANCN) at the early stage of differentiation induction and expressed high levels of cartilage hypertrophy-related factors (Coll10, annexin 5, and ALP) at the late stage. Under the simulated microgravity environment, the IHH transfection group expressed high levels of cartilage-related factors and low levels of cartilage hypertrophy-related factors at all stages of differentiation induction. Under the simulated microgravity environment, transfection of the IHH gene into BMSCs effectively promoted the generation of cartilage and inhibited cartilage aging and osteogenesis. Therefore, this technique is suitable for cartilage tissue engineering."

The present study aimed to explore the cellular uptake mechanisms of three different vectors based on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) in HeLa cells. The use of endocytosis inhibitors that affect specific internalization pathways provides a tool for the study of these routes."

Here, we describe a solid-phase transfection platform that enables CRISPR-based genetic screens in arrayed format with flexible readouts. We demonstrate efficient gene knockout upon delivery of guide RNAs and Cas9/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes into untransformed and cancer cell lines. In addition, we provide evidence that our platform can be easily adapted to high-throughput screens and we use this approach to study oncogene addiction in tumor cells. Finally demonstrating that the human primary cells can also be edited using this method, we pave the way for rapid testing of potential targeted therapies."
