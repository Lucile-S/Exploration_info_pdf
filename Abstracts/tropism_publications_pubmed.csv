The MODERN study prospectively compared genotypic (GTT) and phenotypic (Trofile®) tropism testing with treatment-naive HIV-1-infected participants randomized 1:1 to either GTT or Trofile tropism assessments. Participants with R5 virus were randomized 1:1 to receive darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) with either MVC or tenofovir/emtricitabine. Screening samples were also retrospectively tested using the alternative assay. Positive predictive values (PPVs) for each assay were estimated using both the observed MVC+DRV/r response rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48) and model-based response estimates. The observed MVC+DRV/r response rate was 146/181 (80.7%) for GTT versus 160/215 (74.4%) for Trofile, with a stratification adjusted difference of 6.6% (95% CI, -1.5% to 14.7%) in favor of GTT. The model-based PPV estimates (±standard error) were 80.5% (±2.38) and 78.0% (±2.35) for GTT and Trofile, respectively (difference, 2.5%; 95% CI, -2.0% to 7.0%). Most participants had R5 results using both assays (285/396; 72%) and, of those, 79.3% (226/285) had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48. Both the genotypic and phenotypic tropism assays evaluated can effectively predict treatment response to MVC."

We previously described the MC116 human B cell line as a KSHV-susceptible model to overcome the paradoxical refractoriness of B cell lines to experimental KSHV infection. Here, using monoclonal antibody inhibition and a deletion mutant virus, we demonstrate that the KSHV virion glycoprotein K8.1A is critical for infection of MC116, as well as tonsillar B cells; in contrast, we confirm previous reports on the dispensability of the glycoprotein for infection of primary endothelial cells and other commonly studied non-B cell targets. Surprisingly, we found that the role of K8.1A in B cell infection is independent of its only known biochemical activity of binding to surface heparan sulfate, suggesting the possible involvement of an additional molecular interaction(s). Our finding that K8.1A is a critical determinant for KSHV B cell tropism parallels the importance of proteins encoded by positionally homologous genes for the cell tropism of other gammaherpesviruses."

However, the therapeutic applicability of exosomes is partially hampered by a lack of cell-type specificity. In this study, therefore, we investigated the impact of cell-type tropism on the in vivo systemic delivery of exosomes to tumor tissues. Exosomes derived from murine colorectal cancer cells (C26) (C26-Exos) and murine melanoma cells (B16BL6) (B16BL6-Exos) were collected. In vitro cellular uptake of either autologous (C26) or allogeneic (B16BL6) exosomes by C26 tumor cells was determined. In vivo tumor accumulation of each type of exosomes in mice bearing C26 tumors was monitored with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). In in vitro studies, autologous C26-Exos were more efficiently taken up by C26 cancer cells, compared to allogeneic B16BL6-Exos. For in vivo studies, exosomes were modified with surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve their circulation lifetimes. Although both types of PEGylated exosomes accumulated in C26-tumor tissue, autologous exosomes were preferentially accumulated within C26-tumor tissue compared to allogeneic exosomes. The increased tumor accumulation of autologous PEGylated exosomes was accompanied by the preferential uptake of exosomes by not only C26-tumor cells but also tumor-associated immune cells. This study implies that cancer cell-type tropism is an important factor in the achievement of tumor cell targeting with cancer cell-derived exosomes."

Neurological signs are often the only clinical signs observed in birds infected with neurotropic strains of NDV. Experimental infections have shown that the replication of virulent NDV (vNDV) strains is in the brain parenchyma and is possibly confined to neurons and ependymal cells. However, little information is available on the ability of vNDV strains to infect subset of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of NDV strains of different levels of virulence to infect a subset of glial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from the brains of day-old White Leghorn chickens were harvested, cultured, and infected with both non-virulent (LaSota) and virulent, neurotropic (TxGB) NDV strains.

Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis. In conclusion, natural SEOV infection results in mild inflammation of the liver in the absence of clinical disease."

Clinically, results are mixed partly because MSC tropism to kidneys is minimal following infusion. Ultrasound augmentation of the renal microenvironment is becoming increasingly-important in renal MSC therapies. We demonstrated pulsed-focused-ultrasound (pFUS) increases enhanced homing permeability and retention of MSC in mouse kidneys. Here, we characterized the temporal proteomic response to pFUS in mouse kidneys and its association with MSC tropism. pFUS induced molecular cascades of initial increases in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-1α, that activated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) pathways without cell death. This was followed by a 24-48 hour-long response of increased cell adhesion molecules (CAM), trophic and anti-inflammatory factors. Pretreating animals with anti-inflammatory drugs etanercept (TNFα inhibitor), anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), prednisone (NFκB translocation inhibitor), or ibuprofen (COX inhibitor) suppressed molecular changes and inhibited renal MSC tropism. We further examined the role of COX2 using a COX2-knock-out mouse where pFUS was unable to increase MSC tropism. These results demonstrate that renal micro-environmental changes induce MSC tropism and could influence the therapeutic efficacy of MSC. Optimizing the microenvironment and understanding drug effects will enable improvements in MSC therapies for renal disease."

However, MSCs may show bidirectional and divergent effects on tumor growth. Therefore, a robust surveillance system with a capacity for noninvasive monitoring of the homing, distribution and fate of stem cells in vivo is highly desired for developing stem cell-based gene therapies for tumors. In this study, we used ferritin gene-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track the tumor tropism of MSCs in a rat orthotopic xenograft model of malignant glioma. MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Intra-arterial, intravenous and intertumoral injections of these FTH transgenic MSCs (FTH-MSCs) were performed in rats bearing intracranial orthotopic C6 gliomas. The FTH-MSCs were detected as hypointense signals on T2- and T2*-weighted images on a 3.0 T clinical MRI. After intra-arterial injection, 17% of FTH-MSCs migrated toward the tumor and gradually diffused throughout the orthotopic glioma. This dynamic process could be tracked in vivo by MRI up to 10 days of follow-up, as confirmed by histology. Moreover, the tumor tropism of MSCs showed no appreciable impact on the progression of the tumor. These results suggest that FTH reporter gene-based MRI can be used to reliably track the tropism and fate of MSCs after their systemic transplantation in orthotopic gliomas. This real-time in vivo tracking system will facilitate the future development of stem cell-based therapies for malignant gliomas."

Because these cells home to areas of tissue injury, the authors hypothesized that the administration of ionizing radiation (IR) to tumor would enhance the tropism of MSCs to gliomas. Additionally, they sought to identify which radiation-induced factors might attract MSCs. METHODS To assess the effect of IR on MSC migration in vitro, transwell assays using conditioned medium (CM) from an irradiated commercially available glioma cell line (U87) and from irradiated patient-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs; GSC7-2 and GSC11) were employed. For in vivo testing, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled MSCs were injected into the carotid artery of nude mice harboring orthotopic U87, GSC7-2, or GSC17 xenografts that were treated with either 0 or 10 Gy of IR, and brain sections were quantitatively analyzed by immunofluorescence for GFP-positive cells. These GSCs were used because GSC7-2 is a weak attractor of MSCs at baseline, whereas GSC17 is a strong attractor. To determine the factors implicated in IR-induced tropism, CM from irradiated GSC7-2 and from GSC11 was assayed with a cytokine array and quantitative ELISA. RESULTS Transwell migration assays revealed statistically significant enhanced MSC migration to CM from irradiated U87, GSC7-2, and GSC11 compared with nonirradiated controls and in a dose-dependent manner. After their intravascular delivery into nude mice harboring orthotopic gliomas, MSCs engrafted more successfully in irradiated U87 (p = 0.036), compared with nonirradiated controls. IR also significantly increased the tropism of MSCs to GSC7-2 xenografts (p = 0.043), which are known to attract MSCs only poorly at baseline (weak-attractor GSCs). Ionizing radiation also increased the engraftment of MSCs in strong-attractor GSC17 xenografts, but these increases did not reach statistical significance. The chemokine CCL2 was released by GSC7-2 and GSC11 after irradiation in a dose-dependent manner and mediated in vitro transwell migration of MSCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased CCL2 in irradiated GSC7-2 gliomas near the site of MSC engraftment. CONCLUSIONS Administering IR to gliomas enhances MSC localization, particularly in GSCs that attract MSCs poorly at baseline. The chemokine CCL2 appears to play a crucial role in the IR-induced tropism of MSCs to gliomas."

Subretinal delivery of AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) and its heparan sulfate (HS)-binding-deficient capsid led to similar expression, indicating transduction of the outer retina occurred by HS-independent mechanisms. However, intravitreal delivery of HS-ablated recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) led to a 300-fold decrease in transduction compared to AAV2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of AAV transgenes was used to identify differences in retinal trafficking and revealed that HS binding was responsible for AAV2 accumulation at the ILM. This mechanism was tested on human ex vivo retinas and showed similar accumulation with HS-binding AAV2 capsid only. To evaluate if HS binding could be applied to other AAV serotypes to enhance their transduction, AAV1 and AAV8 were modified to bind HS with a single-amino-acid mutation and tested in mice. Both HS-binding mutants of AAV1 and AAV8 had higher intravitreal transduction than their non-HS-binding parent capsid due to increased retinal accumulation. To understand the influence that HS binding has on tropism, chimeric AAV2 capsids with dual-glycan usage were tested intravitreally in mice. Compared to HS binding alone, these chimeric capsids displayed enhanced transduction that was correlated with a change in tropism. Taken together, these data indicate that HS binding serves to sequester AAV capsids from the vitreous to the ILM but does not influence retinal tropism. The enhanced retinal transduction of HS-binding capsids provides a rational design strategy for engineering capsids for intravitreal delivery."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered a promising factor for enhancing cardiac function by promoting angiogenesis. However, the lack of a suitable method of VEGF delivery to the MI area is a serious challenge. In this study, we screened a suitable delivery carrier with favorable biocompatibility that targeted the MI area using the strategy of an inherent structure derived from the body and that was based on characteristics of the MI. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important infiltrating cells that are derived from blood and have an inherent tropism for the MI zone. We hypothesized that VEGF-encapsulated MSCs targeting MI tissue could improve cardiac function by angiogenesis based on the tropism of the MSCs to the MI area. We first developed VEGF-encapsulated MSCs using self-assembled gelatin and alginate polyelectrolytes to improve angiogenesis and cardiac function. In vitro, the results showed that VEGF-encapsulated MSCs had a sustained release of VEGF and tropism to SDF-1. In vivo, VEGF-encapsulated MSCs migrated to the MI area, enhanced cardiac function, perfused the infarcted area and promoted angiogenesis.

Yet when some avian strains do acquire the ability to overcome species barrier, they might become adapted to humans, replicating efficiently and causing diseases, leading to potential pandemic. With the huge influenza A virus reservoir in wild birds, it is a cause for concern when a new influenza strain emerges with the ability to cross host species barrier, as shown in light of the recent H7N9 outbreak in China. Several influenza proteins have been shown to be major determinants in host tropism. Further understanding and determining host tropism would be important in identifying zoonotic influenza virus strains capable of crossing species barrier and infecting humans."

The intracellular bacteria Wolbachia have a peculiar tropism for the stem cell niches in the Drosophila ovary, the microenvironments that support the cells producing the eggs. The molecular underpinnings of Wolbachia stem cell niche tropism are unknown. We have previously shown that the patterns of tropism in the ovary show a high degree of conservation across the Wolbachia lineage, with closely related Wolbachia strains usually displaying the same pattern of stem cell niche tropism. It has also been shown that tropism to these structures in the ovary facilitates both vertical and horizontal transmission, providing a strong selective pressure towards evolutionary conservation of tropism. Here we show great disparity in the evolutionary conservation and underlying mechanisms of stem cell niche tropism between male and female gonads. In contrast to females, niche tropism in the male testis is not pervasive, present in only 45% of niches analyzed. The patterns of niche tropism in the testis are not evolutionarily maintained across the Wolbachia lineage, unlike what was shown in the females. Furthermore, hub tropism does not correlate with cytoplasmic incompatibility, a Wolbachia-driven phenotype imprinted during spermatogenesis. Towards identifying the molecular mechanism of hub tropism, we performed hybrid analyses of Wolbachia strains in non-native hosts. These results indicate that both Wolbachia and host derived factors play a role in the targeting of the stem cell niche in the testis. Surprisingly, even closely related Wolbachia strains in Drosophila melanogaster, derived from a single ancestor only 8,000 years ago, have significantly different tropisms to the hub, highlighting that stem cell niche tropism is rapidly diverging in males. These findings provide a powerful system to investigate the mechanisms and evolution of microbial tissue tropism. "

The present study aimed to investigate the association between FT and LDH in adolescents. METHODS This study included 65 adolescents with LDH with 1- or 2-level LDH, or both. Facet angles were measured with MRI. FT was defined as asymmetry of 10° between the left and right side. The same levels of 30 healthy persons who had no lumbar lesions were used as controls. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. RESULTS FT was identified in 16 of 39 patients with LDH in L4-5 and in 3 of 30 controls (p = 0.006, OR 6.261, 95% CI 1.619-24.217). It was also identified in 12 of 27 patients with LDH in L5-S1 and in 4 of 30 controls (p = 0.017, OR 5.200, 95% CI 1.420-19.039). One patient had LDH in both L4-5 and L5-S1.

Many past epidemic as well as pandemic strains have originated from avian species. While most viruses are restricted to their primary hosts, zoonotic strains can sometimes arise from mutations or reassortment, leading them to acquire the capability to escape host species barrier and successfully infect a new host. Phylogenetic analyses and genetic markers are useful in tracing the origins of zoonotic infections, but there are still no effective means to identify high risk strains prior to an outbreak. Here we show that distinct host tropism protein signatures can be used to identify possible zoonotic strains in avian species which have the potential to cause human infections. We have discovered that influenza A viruses can now be classified into avian, human, or zoonotic strains based on their host tropism protein signatures. Analysis of all influenza A viruses with complete proteome using the host tropism prediction system, based on machine learning classifications of avian and human viral proteins has uncovered distinct signatures of zoonotic strains as mosaics of avian and human viral proteins. This is in contrast with typical avian or human strains where they show mostly avian or human viral proteins in their signatures respectively. Moreover, we have found that zoonotic strains from the same influenza outbreaks carry similar host tropism protein signatures characteristic of a common ancestry. Our results demonstrate that the distinct host tropism protein signature in zoonotic strains may prove useful in influenza surveillance to rapidly identify potential high risk strains circulating in avian species, which may grant us the foresight in anticipating an impending influenza outbreak.

Typhoid toxin, a unique virulence factor of Salmonella Typhi (the cause of typhoid fever), recapitulates in an animal model many symptoms of typhoid fever. Typhoid toxin binding to its glycan receptor Neu5Ac is central, but, due to the ubiquity of Neu5Ac, how typhoid toxin causes specific symptoms remains elusive. Here we show that typhoid toxin displays in vivo tropism to cells expressing multiantennal glycoprotein receptors, particularly on endothelial cells of arterioles in the brain and immune cells, which is in line with typhoid symptoms. Neu5Ac displayed by multiantennal N-glycans, rather than a single Neu5Ac, appears to serve as the high-affinity receptor, as typhoid toxin possesses five identical binding pockets per toxin. Human counterparts also express the multiantennal Neu5Ac receptor. Here we also show that mice immunized with inactive typhoid toxins and challenged with wild-type typhoid toxin presented neither the characteristic in vivo tropism nor symptoms. These mice were protected against a lethal-dose toxin challenge, but Ty21a-vaccinated mice were not. Cumulatively, these results reveal remarkable features describing how a bacterial exotoxin induces virulence exclusively in specific cells at the organismal level."

MYXV tropism for human cancer cells is largely mediated by intracellular signaling networks that regulate viral replication or innate antiviral response pathways. Thus, MYXV is fully or partially permissive for the majority of human cancer cells that harbor defects in antiviral signaling, but a minority are nonpermissive because the virus infection aborts before its completion. To identify host factors relevant for MYXV tropism in human cancer cells, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screen targeting the 58 human DEAD-box RNA helicases in two permissive human cancer cells (HeLa and A549), one semi-permissive (786-0), and one nonpermissive cell line (PANC-1). Five host RNA helicases (DDX3X, DDX5, DHX9, DHX37, DDX52) were inhibitory for optimal replication and thus classified as anti-viral, while three other cellular RNA helicases (DHX29, DHX35, RIG-I) were identified as pro-viral or pro-cellular because knockdown consistently reduced MYXV replication and/or required metabolic functions of permissive cancer cells. These findings suggest that replication of MYXV, and likely all poxviruses, is dramatically regulated positively and negatively by multiple host DEAD-box RNA helicases."

Vaccinated goats were seropositive by 9 days post vaccination (dpv) while in sheep idiosyncratic response was observed between 9 and 14 dpv for different animals. Expression of PPRV N gene was not detected in PBMCs of vaccinated and vaccinated challenged groups of both species, but was detected in unvaccinated infected PBMCs at 9 and 14 days post infection. The higher viral load at 9 dpi coincided with the peak clinical signs of the disease. The peak in viral replication at 9 dpi correlated with significant expression of antiviral molecules IRF3, ISG15 and IFN gamma in both the species. With the progression of disease, the decrease in N gene expression also correlated with the decrease in expression of IRF3, ISG15 and IFN gamma. In the unvaccinated infected animals ISG15, IRF3, IFN gamma and IL10 expression was higher than vaccinated animals. The IFN gamma expression predominated over IL4 in both vaccinated and infected animals with the infected exhibiting a stronger Th1 response.

Using a 4-point scale, 3 blinded readers independently graded the severity of facet tropism and facet arthrosis of 79 cervical facet joints on axial T2-weighted and sagittal T1 and T2-weighted turbo spin echo images as well as the corresponding axial CT scans. All results were subjected to the kappa coefficient statistic for strength of agreement. In the assessment of the severity of facet arthrosis, intermethod agreement (weighted κ) between CT scanning with a moderate inter-rater reliability (range κ = 0.43-0.57) and MRI with fair inter-rater reliability (range κ = 0.23-0.38) was 0.76 and 0.43 for the severity of facet tropism and facet arthrosis, respectively. Intra-rater reliability for the severity of facet arthrosis was moderate to substantial for CT and was moderate for MRI scans. Intra-rater reliability for the severity of facet tropism was substantial to very good for CT and substantial for MRI scans. MRI can reliably determine the presence or degree of facet tropism but not facet arthrosis. Therefore, for a comprehensive assessment of cervical facet joint degeneration, both a CT and an MRI scan should be performed. "

Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R0 ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms.

The migrated iPSCs to the gliomas kept expressing Nanog-GFP gene, suggesting no neuronal or glial differentiation. iPSCs or iPS-NSCs labeled with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine were intracranially implanted in the contralateral hemisphere to the GL261 glioma cell implantation in the allogeneic C57BL/6 mouse. Active migration of both stem cells was observed 7 days after implantation. Again, the iPSCs located in the tumor area expressed Nanog-GFP gene, suggesting that the migrated cells were still iPSCs. These findings demonstrated that both iPSCs and iPS-NSCs had potent glioma tropism and could be candidates as vehicles in stem cell-based glioma therapy. "

A major impediment to understanding the mechanistic basis of these symbioses has been lack of genetic manipulation tools, for instance, those enabling transgenic GFP expression systems for in vivo visualization. Here, we transform the 'son-killer' reproductive parasite Arsenophonus nasoniae that infects the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis with the plasmid pOM1-gfp, re-introduce this strain to N. vitripennis and then used this system to track symbiont life history in vivo. These data revealed transfer of the symbiont into the fly pupa by N. vitripennis during oviposition and N. vitripennis larvae developing infection over time through feeding. A strong tropism of A. nasoniae to the N. vitripennis ovipositor developed during wasp pupation, which aids onward transmission. The symbiont was also visualized in diapause larvae. Occasional necrotic diapause larvae were observed which displayed intense systemic infection alongside widespread melanotic nodules indicative of an active but failed immune response. Our results provide the foundation for the study of this symbiosis through in vivo tracking of the fate of symbionts through host development, which is rarely achieved in heritable microbe/insect interactions."

Some of them found that lumbar disc herniation was on the side of the more sagittal facet joint interface. However, little is understood about the association of facet tropism with disc herniation in the cervical spine. As the relationship between the facet orientation and the side of cervical disc herniation (CDH) is unclear, the purpose of this study is to investigate that relationship. Ninety-six patients with single-level CDH (C4-C5, C5-C6 or C6-C7) were included in the CDH group of this study. Another 50 age-matched and gender-matched healthy participants who accepted physical examinations were enrolled as the control group. The cervical facet angles of two sides were measured using axial computed tomography (CT). The intersection angle of the midsagittal line of the vertebra to the facet line represents the facet angle. Facet tropism was defined as the angular difference of 7º between the left and the right sides. Facet tropism angle was recorded as the absolute value of the difference of facet angles between two sides. There were 20 herniations at C4-C5 level, 50 herniations at C5-C6 level and 26 herniations at C6-C7 level. The present study showed that more cases in the CDH group had facet tropism than did those in the control group at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7 level (p = .021, p = .001, p = .015, respectively). The facet tropism angles in the CDH group were significantly bigger than those in the control group at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7 level (p = .001, p = .002, p = .028, respectively). In the CDH group, the facet angles on the herniated side were found to be significantly bigger than those on the healthy side at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7 level (p = .000, p = .000, p = .037, respectively). The findings of this present study suggest that facet tropism is associated with the disc herniation in the cervical spine. We also found that cervical disc herniates towards the side of the bigger facet angle with respect to the sagittal plane.

Using intravital imaging and loss of function experiments, we determined invadopodia contain receptors involved in chemotaxis, namely GABA receptor and EGFR. These chemotaxis capabilities are mediated in part by PAK1 which controls invadopodia responsiveness to ligands such as GABA and EGF via assembly, stability, and turnover of invadopodia in vivo. PAK1 knockdown rendered cells unresponsive to chemotactic stimuli present in the stroma, resulting in dramatically lower rates of cancer cell extravasation and metastatic colony formation compared to stimulated cancer cells. In an experimental mouse model of brain metastasis, inhibition of PAK1 significantly reduced overall tumor burden and reduced the average size of brain metastases. In summary, invadopodia contain chemotaxis receptors that can respond to microenvironmental cues to guide cancer cell extravasation, and when PAK1 is depleted, brain tropism of metastatic breast cancer cells is significantly reduced, blocking secondary colony growth at sites otherwise permissive for metastatic outgrowth."

V3 loop sequences from 732 clinical samples with diverse characteristics were used to build a case library. Additional sequence and molecular properties of the V3 loop were examined and used for similarity assessment. A similarity metric was defined based on each attribute's frequency in the CXCR4-using viruses. We implemented three other genotype-based tropism predictors, support vector machines (SVM), position specific scoring matrices (PSSM), and the 11/25 rule, and evaluated their performance as the ability to predict CRT compared to Monogram's enhanced sensitivity Trofile(®) assay (ESTA). Overall concordance of the CBR based tropism prediction algorithm was 81%, as compared to ESTA. Sensitivity to detect CXCR4 usage was 90% and specificity was at 73%. In comparison, sensitivity of the SVM, PSSM, and the 11/25 rule were 85%, 81%, and 36% respectively while achieving a specificity of 90% by SVM, 75% by PSSM, and 97% by the 11/25 rule. When we evaluated these predictors in an unseen dataset, higher sensitivity was achieved by the CBR algorithm (87%), compared to SVM (82%), PSSM (76%), and the 11/25 rule (33%), while maintaining similar level of specificity. Overall this study suggests that CBR can be utilized as a genotypic tropism prediction tool, and can achieve improved performance in independent datasets compared to model or rule based methods. "

The tissue tropism is determined by spike (S) protein, although the molecular bases for enteric tropism remain to be fully characterized. Both pAPN and sialic acid binding domains (aa 506-655 and 145-155, respectively) are necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection.

In vivo tropism, either enteric, respiratory or both, was studied by inoculating three-day-old piglets and analyzing viral titers in lung and gut. The data indicated that U655>G change in S gene (S219A in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to a respiratory virus that already contains the pAPN and sialic acid binding domains in its S protein. Moreover, an engineered virus containing U655>G and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 (Y374-T375insND in S protein) was genetically stable after passage in cell cultures, and increased virus titers in gut by 1000-fold.

For example, the three major Lyme disease spirochete species, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii, are each most commonly associated with overlapping but distinct spectra of clinical manifestations. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the most common Lyme spirochete in the U.S., is closely associated with arthritis. The attachment of microbial pathogens to cells or to the extracellular matrix of target tissues may promote colonization and disease, and the Lyme disease spirochete encodes several surface proteins, including the decorin- and dermatan sulfate-binding adhesin DbpA, which vary among strains and have been postulated to contribute to strain-specific differences in tissue tropism. DbpA variants differ in their ability to bind to its host ligands and to cultured mammalian cells. To directly test whether variation in dbpA influences tissue tropism, we analyzed murine infection by isogenic B. burgdorferi strains that encode different dbpA alleles. Compared to dbpA alleles of B. afzelii strain VS461 or B. burgdorferi strain N40-D10/E9, dbpA of B. garinii strain PBr conferred the greatest decorin- and dermatan sulfate-binding activity, promoted the greatest colonization at the inoculation site and heart, and caused the most severe carditis. The dbpA of strain N40-D10/E9 conferred the weakest decorin- and GAG-binding activity, but the most robust joint colonization and was the only dbpA allele capable of conferring significant joint disease. Thus, dbpA mediates colonization and disease by the Lyme disease spirochete in an allele-dependent manner and may contribute to the etiology of distinct clinical manifestations associated with different Lyme disease strains. This study provides important support for the long-postulated model that strain-specific variations of Borrelia surface proteins influence tissue tropism. "

There are several mechanisms for regulating viral tropism, however they tend to be virus class specific and many result in virus attenuation. Additionally, many viruses, including picornaviruses, exhibit size constraints that do not allow for incorporation of large amounts of foreign genetic material required for some targeting methods. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells by binding complementary target sequences in messenger RNAs, preventing their translation or accelerating their degradation. Different cells exhibit distinct microRNA signatures and many microRNAs serve as biomarkers. These differential expression patterns can be exploited for restricting gene expression in cells that express specific microRNAs while maintaining expression in cells that do not. In regards to regulating viral tropism, sequences complementary to specific microRNAs are incorporated into the viral genome, generally in the 3' non-coding regions, targeting them for destruction in the presence of the cognate microRNAs thus preventing viral gene expression and/or replication. MicroRNA-targeting is a technique that theoretically can be applied to all viral vectors without altering the potency of the virus in the absence of the corresponding microRNAs. Here we describe experimental methods associated with generating a microRNA-targeted picornavirus and evaluating the efficacy and specificity of that targeting in vitro. This protocol is designed for a rapidly replicating virus with a lytic replication cycle, however, modification of the time points analyzed and the specific virus titration readouts used will aid in the adaptation of this protocol to many different viruses."

In this study, we obtained homologous bone marrow-derived (BM-) and adipose tissue-derived (AT-) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), fibroblast, and cancer stem cell-like glioma cells (CSGCs) from tumor-bearing mice, and compared the tropism character of BM- and AT-MSCs for CSGCs with various form of existence.

Our results showed that the CSGCs during the process of cell proliferation, but not in resting and differentiated status, display strong tropism characteristics on both BM- and AT-MSCs, as well as the expression of their cell chemokine factors which mediate cell migration. If the conclusion is further confirmed, it may expose a fatal flaw of MSCs as tumor-targeted delivery of therapeutic agents in the treatment of the CSGCs, even other cancer stem cells, because there always exist a part of cancer stem cells that are in resting status. Overall, our findings provide novel insight into the complex issue of the MSCs as drug delivery in the treatment of brain tumors, especially in tumor stem cells. "

Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal.

We report that it evolved through a likely human-to-rabbit host jump over 40 years ago and that only a single naturally occurring nucleotide mutation was required and sufficient to convert a human-specific S. aureus strain into one that could infect rabbits. Related mutations were identified at the same locus in other rabbit strains of distinct clonal origin, consistent with convergent evolution. This first report of a single mutation that was sufficient to alter the host tropism of a microorganism during its evolution highlights the capacity of some pathogens to readily expand into new host species populations.

It binds to the host coreceptor CCR5, which is used by the majority of HIV strains in order to infect the human immune cells (Fig. 1). Other HIV isolates use a different coreceptor, the CXCR4. Which receptor is used, is determined in the virus by the Env protein (Fig. 2). Depending on the coreceptor used, the viruses are classified as R5 or X4, respectively. MVC binds to the CCR5 receptor inhibiting the entry of R5 viruses into the target cell. During the course of disease, X4 viruses may emerge and outgrow the R5 viruses. Determination of coreceptor usage (also called tropism) is therefore mandatory prior to administration of MVC, as demanded by EMA and FDA. The studies for MVC efficiency MOTIVATE, MERIT and 1029 have been performed with the Trofile assay from Monogram, San Francisco, U.S.A. This is a high quality assay based on sophisticated recombinant tests. The acceptance for this test for daily routine is rather low outside of the U.S.A., since the European physicians rather tend to work with decentralized expert laboratories, which also provide concomitant resistance testing. These laboratories have undergone several quality assurance evaluations, the last one being presented in 2011. For several years now, we have performed tropism determinations based on sequence analysis from the HIV env-V3 gene region (V3). This region carries enough information to perform a reliable prediction. The genotypic determination of coreceptor usage presents advantages such as: shorter turnover time (equivalent to resistance testing), lower costs, possibility to adapt the results to the patients' needs and possibility of analysing clinical samples with very low or even undetectable viral load (VL), particularly since the number of samples analysed with VL < 1000 copies/μl roughly increased in the last years (Fig. 3). The main steps for tropism testing (Fig. 4) demonstrated in this video: Collection of a blood sample Isolation of the HIV RNA from the plasma and/or HIV proviral DNA from blood mononuclear cells Amplification of the env region Amplification of the V3 region Sequence reaction of the V3 amplicon Purification of the sequencing samples Sequencing the purified samples Sequence editing Sequencing data interpretation and tropism prediction."

Considering the overall growth of both viruses, lung cultures ensured the most efficient growth of TUN12L226N384 strain with titres up to 10(9) TCID50/ml whereas small intestine culture was highly susceptible to the TUN51Q226T384 virus reaching a titre of 10(6) TCID50/ml. The lowest replication was shown in liver cells. The addition of trypsin was essential for the replication of either virus in primary fibroblasts, but it had a marginal positive effect on virus replication in the four other culture types with maximum titres of 10(8) TCID50/ml. This means that in chicken, the proteolytic activation of the H9N2 viruses with the cleavage motif RSSR may be mediated by other endoproteases than trypsin. Further investigations should concentrate on the production of the appropriate set of viruses by a reverse genetics approach and the examination of cellular protease expression in chicken tissues.

While animal models are very useful, they often exhibit differences in retinal cell surface receptors compared to the human retina. This study evaluated the use of an ex vivo organotypic explant system to test the transduction efficiency and tropism of seven different adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) serotypes in the human retina and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid-AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/4, AAV2/5, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, and AAV2/9-all driving expression of GFP under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 7 days in culture, it was found that AAV2/4 and AAV2/5 were particularly efficient at transducing photoreceptor cells and that AAV2/5 was highly specific to the outer nuclear layer, whereas AAV2/8 displayed consistently low transduction of photoreceptors. To validate the authenticity of the organotypic culture system, the transduction of the same set of AAVs was also compared in a pig model, in which sub-retinal injections in vivo were compared to cultured and transduced organotypic cultures ex vivo.

The aim of our study was to investigate the tropism of N-D-BMSCs towards C6 glioma. In vitro migration assay was employed by transwell co-culture system and Student's t-test analysis indicated that N-D-BMSCs had the significant tropism towards C6 glioma-conditioned medium (GCM) (P<0.01). Furthermore, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) bioactivity of the C6 GCM was neutralized by the anti-rat VEGF antibody and our data suggested that the VEGF from C6 GCM hold chemoattraction for N-D-BMSCs and some other cytokines from the C6 GCM may be responsible for the chemoattraction for N-D-BMSCs. In vivo migration assay was carried out with cells transplantation and one way ANOVA analysis indicated that the tropism of N-D-BMSCs towards C6 glioma sites presented time variation (P-value=2.9E-20). Moreover, multiple comparisons for the time variables with the Student's t-test and the results suggested that the migration capacity of N-D-BMSCs towards C6 glioma sites reach the peak on the 7th day after transplantation.

Roseolovirus reactivation in an immunocompromised host can cause severe pathologies. While the pathogenic potential of HHV-7 is unclear, it can reactivate HHV-6 from latency and thus contributes to severe pathological conditions associated with HHV-6. Because of the ubiquitous nature of roseoloviruses, their roles in such interactions and the resulting pathological consequences have been difficult to study. Furthermore, the lack of a relevant animal model for HHV-7 infection has hindered a better understanding of its contribution to roseolovirus-associated diseases. Using next-generation sequencing analysis, we characterized the unique genome of an uncultured novel pigtailed macaque roseolovirus. Detailed genomic analysis revealed the presence of gene homologs to all 84 known HHV-7 open reading frames. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus is a macaque homolog of HHV-7, which we have provisionally named Macaca nemestrina herpesvirus 7 (MneHV7). Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we observed that the salivary gland tissue samples from nine different macaques had distinct MneHV7 gene expression patterns and that the overall number of viral transcripts correlated with viral loads in parotid gland tissue and saliva. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that, like HHV-7, MneHV7 exhibits a natural tropism for salivary gland ductal cells. We also observed staining for MneHV7 in peripheral nerve ganglia present in salivary gland tissues, suggesting that HHV-7 may also have a tropism for the peripheral nervous system. Our data demonstrate that MneHV7-infected macaques represent a relevant animal model that may help clarify the causality between roseolovirus reactivation and diseases."

However, clinical applications of Ad vectors are currently restricted by their immunogenicity and broad native tropism. To address these obstacles, a variety of nonimmunogenic polymers are utilized to modify Ad vectors chemically or physically. In this review, we systemically discuss the functions of polymers in Ad-mediated gene delivery from two aspects: evading the host immune responses to Ads and redirecting Ad tropism. With polyethylene glycol (PEG) first in order, a variety of polymers have been developed to shield the surface of Ad vectors and well accomplished to evade the host immune response, block CAR-dependant cellular uptake, and reduce accumulation in the liver. In addition, shielding Ad vectors with targeted polymers (including targeting ligand-conjugated polymers and bio-responsive polymers) can also efficiently retarget Ad vectors to tumor tissues and reduce their distribution in nontargeted tissues. With its potential to evade the immune response and retarget Ad vectors, modification with polymers has been generally regarded as a promising strategy to facilitate the clinical applications of Ad vectors for virotherapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is no doubt that Adenovirus (Ads) are attractive vectors for gene therapy, with high sophistication and effectiveness in overcoming both extra- and intracellular barriers, which cannot be exceeded by any other nonviral gene vectors. Unfortunately, their clinical applications are still restricted by some critical hurdles, including immunogenicity and native broad tropism. Therefore, a variety of elegant strategies have been developed from various angles to address these hurdles. Among these various strategies, coating Ads with nonimmunogenic polymers has attracted much attention. In this review, we systemically discuss the functions of polymers in Ad-mediated gene delivery from two aspects: evading the host immune responses to Ads and redirecting Ad tropism. In addition, the key factors in Ad modification with polymers have been highlighted and summarized to provide guiding theory for the design of more effective and safer polymer-Ad hybrid gene vectors."

The biomechanical cause of accelerated degeneration of stabilizing structures in lower lumbar spine lies within the combination of several factors, but two most important ones are compressive load and more coronal facet orientation that offers less resistance against torsional loading. Axial rotation of lower lumbar spine is undoubtedly associated with higher strain in disc annulus, and enhanced range of secondary rotational movements may be even more significant for the progression of annular degeneration. Accordingly, more pronounced facet tropism could be having part in faster progression of disc degeneration in lower lumbar spine, as indicated by a number of recent studies. More sagittal facet orientation in patients with a higher facet osteoarthritis score at lower lumbar segments is very likely related to arthritic remodeling commonly seen in other synovial joints. There is also a possibility that it could be associated with the adaptation to partial loss of lumbar lordosis, as both coincide with advanced age."

The location of influenza virus infection along the respiratory tract is a key determinant of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility, which are at the basis of influenza burdens in the human population. As the pathogenicity and transmissibility of influenza virus ultimately determine its reproductive fitness at the population level, strong selective pressures will shape influenza virus tissue tropisms that maximize fitness. At present, the relationships between influenza virus tissue tropism within hosts and reproductive fitness at the population level are poorly understood. The selective pressures and constraints that shape tissue tropism and thereby influence the location of influenza virus infection along the respiratory tract are not well characterized. We use mathematical models that link within-host infection dynamics in a spatially-structured human respiratory tract to between-host transmission dynamics, with the aim of characterizing the possible selective pressures on influenza virus tissue tropism. The results indicate that spatial heterogeneities in virus clearance, virus pathogenicity or both, resulting from the unique structure of the respiratory tract, may drive optimal receptor binding affinity--that maximizes influenza virus reproductive fitness at the population level--towards sialic acids with α2,6 linkage to galactose. The expanding cell pool deeper down the respiratory tract, in association with lower clearance rates, may result in optimal infectivity rates--that likewise maximize influenza virus reproductive fitness at the population level--to exhibit a decreasing trend towards deeper regions of the respiratory tract. Lastly, pre-existing immunity may drive influenza virus tissue tropism towards upper regions of the respiratory tract. The proposed framework provides a new template for the cross-scale study of influenza virus evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics in humans."

A molecular epidemiology investigation of co-receptor tropism is important for clinical practice and effective control of HIV-1. In this study, we investigated the co-receptor tropism on HIV-1 variants of 85 antiretroviral-naive patients with Geno2pheno algorithm at a false-positive rate of 10%. Our data showed that a majority of the subjects harboured the CCR5-tropic virus (81.2%, 69/85). No significant differences in gender, age, baseline CD4+ T-cell counts and transmission routes were observed between subjects infected with CXCR4-tropic or CCR5-tropic virus. The co-receptor tropism appeared to be associated with the virus genotype; a significantly more CXCR4-use was predicted in CRF01_AE infections whereas all CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC were predicted to use CCR5 co-receptor. Sequences analysis of V3 revealed a higher median net charge in the CXCR4 viruses over CCR5 viruses (4.0 vs. 3.0, P &lt; 0.05). The predicted N-linked glycosylation site between amino acids 6 and 8 in the V3 region was conserved in CCR5 viruses, but not in CXCR4 viruses. Besides, variable crown motifs were observed in both CCR5 and CXCR4 viruses, of which the most prevalent motif GPGQ existed in both viral tropism and almost all genotypes identified in this study except subtype B.

IBV was detected in the small intestine, but not in the respiratory tract or kidney. During virus isolation in embryos, it did not replicate in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) but could be recovered from intestines. Its S1 protein showed 93% amino acid sequence identity to a California variant isolated in 1999 (Cal99). Intestinal lesions were reproduced following ocular/nasal inoculation of specific-pathogen-free chickens, but respiratory signs and lesions were also present. The virus was detected in both respiratory and intestinal tissues. To determine whether the novel tropism of IBV CalEnt was due to an increased ability of its S1 protein to bind to the intestinal epithelium, we compared the binding of soluble trimeric recombinant S1 proteins derived from CalEnt and Cal99 to chicken tissues. Contrary to expectations, the CalEnt S1 protein did not bind to small intestine and, unlike Cal99 S1, did not bind to the respiratory epithelium or CAM. Using only the CalEnt S1 N-terminal domain or including the S2 ectodomain (lacking membrane and cytoplasmic domains), which have been shown to improve ArkDPI S1 protein binding, did not lead to detectable binding at the standard protein concentration to any tissue tested. Our results indicate no/poor binding of the CalEnt spike protein to both respiratory and intestinal tissues and thus do not support better attachment to intestinal epithelial cells as a reason for CalEnt's extended tropism. These results might reflect shortcomings of the assay, including that it does not detect potential contributions of the S1 C-terminal domain to attachment. We used bioinformatic approaches to explore the possibility that the unique tropism of CalEnt might be a result of functions of the S protein in cell-entry steps subsequent to attachment. These analyses suggest that CalEnt's S2 coding region was acquired through a recombination event and encodes a unique amino acid sequence at the putative recognition site for the protease that activates the S protein for fusion. Thus, S2 activation by tissue-specific proteases might facilitate CalEnt entry into intestinal epithelial cells and compensate for poor binding by its S1 protein."

Therefore, identifying the distinct pathogenic pathways of the disease may lead to new therapeutic strategies with lower risk of treatment failure.

By deletion mutagenesis, we discovered that the nsp2 hypervariable region plays an important role in controlling the balance of genomic mRNA and a subset of subgenomic mRNAs. More significantly, we revealed an unexpected link of the nsp2 hypervariable region to viral tropism. Specifically, a mutant of the Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06 carrying a deletion spanning nsp2 amino acids 323 to 521 (nsp2Δ323-521) in its hypervariable region was found to lose infectivity in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), although it could replicate relatively efficiently in the supporting cell line MARC-145. Consequently, this mutant failed to establish an infection in piglets. Further dissection of the viral life cycle revealed that the mutant had a defect (or defects) lying in the steps between virus penetration and negative-stranded RNA synthesis. Taken together, our results reveal novel functions of nsp2 in the PRRSV life cycle and provide important insights into the mechanisms of PRRSV RNA synthesis and cellular tropism."

These 30-100nm sized vesicles are released from the cells into the extracellular space and ultimately into biofluids in a tightly regulated way. Their molecular composition reflects their cells of origin, may confer specific cell or tissue tropism and underlines their biological activity. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry specific sets of proteins, nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA and regulatory RNAs), lipids and metabolites that represent an appealing source of novel noninvasive markers through biofluid biopsies. Exosome-shuttled molecules maintain their biological activity and are capable of modulating and reprogramming recipient cells. This multi-faceted nature of exosomes hold great promise for improving cancer treatment featuring them as novel diagnostic sensors as well as therapeutic effectors and drug delivery vectors. Natural biological activity including the therapeutic payload and targeting behavior of EVs can be tuned via genetic and chemical engineering. In this review we describe the properties that EVs share with conventional synthetic nanoparticles, including size, liposome-like membrane bilayer with customizable surface, and multifunctional capacity. We also highlight unique characteristics of EVs, which possibly allow them to circumvent some limitations of synthetic nanoparticle systems and facilitate clinical translation. The latter are in particular correlated with their innate stability, ability to cross biological barriers, efficiently deliver bioactive cargos or evade immune recognition. Furthermore, we discuss the potential roles for EVs in diagnostics and theranostics, and highlight the challenges that still need to be overcome before EVs can be applied to routine clinical practice."

A bioinformatics study showed that this inhibition might be due to specific microRNAs (miRNAs) present in non-permissive cells but not in permissive EPCs. To confirm the hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of miRNAs on VP expression. CD34(+) HSCs were separated from cord blood. Then, CD34(+) cells were treated with differentiation medium to obtain CD36(+) EPCs. To evaluate the effect of miRNAs on VP expression in MCF7 and HEK-293 cell lines (non-permissive cells) and CD36(+) EPCs, dual luciferase assay was performed in presence of shRNAs against Dicer and Drosha to disrupt miRNA biogenesis. QRT-PCR was performed to check down-regulation of Dicer and Drosha after transfection. All measurements were done in triplicate. Data means were compared using one-way ANOVAs. MicroRNA prediction was done by the online microRNA prediction tools. No significant difference was shown in luciferase activity of CD36(+) EPCs after co-transfection with shRNAs, while it was significant in non-permissive cells.

Recent work has demonstrated that >80% of antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells remain in the pulmonary vasculature following an intratracheal infection with a systemic viral pathogen. However, it remains unclear what proportion of effector CD8 T cells are located within lung tissue following a localized respiratory viral infection.

In contrast, following pulmonary viral infections with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza A virus (IAV), 80 to 90% of the antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells were located within lung tissue.

We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells.

The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies."

This interaction plays a key role in determining anatomic sites that are infected in vivo and the cascade of early and late events that result in chronic immune activation, immunosuppression and ultimately, AIDS. CD4+ T cells are critical to adaptive immune responses, and their early and rapid infection in gut lamina propria and secondary lymphoid tissues in susceptible hosts likely contributes to viral persistence and progression to disease. CD4+ macrophages are also infected, although their role in HIV-1 pathogenesis is more controversial."

Experimentally, these TARVs induced remarkable tenosynovitis in gastrocnemius tendons of turkey poults. The current study aimed to characterize the location and the extent of virus replication as well as the cytokine response induced by TARV during the first two weeks of infection. One-week-old male turkeys were inoculated orally with TARV (O'Neil strain). Copy numbers of viral genes were estimated in intestines, internal organs and tendons at ½, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 days Post inoculation (dpi). Cytokine profile was measured in intestines, spleen and leg tendons at 0, 4, 7 and 14 dpi. Viral copy number peaked in jejunum, cecum and bursa of Fabricius at 4 dpi. Copy numbers increased dramatically in leg tendons at 7 and 14 dpi while minimal copies were detected in internal organs and blood during the same period. Virus was detected in cloacal swabs at 1-2 dpi, and peaked at 14 dpi indicating enterotropism of the virus and its early shedding in feces. Elevation of IFN-α and IFN-β was observed in intestines at 7 dpi as well as a prominent T helper-1 response (IFN-γ) at 7 and 14 dpi. IFN-γ and IL-6 were elevated in gastrocnemius tendons at 14 dpi. Elevation of antiviral cytokines in intestines occurred at 7dpi when a significant decline of viral replication in intestines was observed. T helper-1 response in intestines and leg tendons was the dominant T-helper response. These results suggest the possible correlation between viral replication and cytokine response in early infection of TARV in turkeys. Our findings provide novel insights which help elucidate viral pathogenesis in turkey tendons infected with TARV. "

In the present study, the localization and kinetics of virus replication were investigated in various tissues after experimental intravenous infection of pigs. The data demonstrate a rapid and broad spreading of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) and various other organs. A particular tropism of JEV in pigs not only to the CNS but also for secondary lymphoid tissue, in particular the tonsils with the overall highest viral loads, was observed. In this organ, even 11 days post infection, the latest time point of the experiment, no apparent decrease in viral RNA loads and live virus was found despite the presence of a neutralizing antibody response. This was also well beyond the clinical and viremic phase. These results are of significance for the pathogenesis of JEV, and call for further experimental studies focusing on the cellular source and duration of virus replication in pigs."

A total of 200 V3 sequences from HIV-1 subtype B, available in several databases with known phenotypic tropism results, were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of seven different bioinformatic tools (PSSM, SVM, C4.5 decision tree generator and C4.5, PART, Charge Rule, and Geno2pheno). The best predictive bioinformatic tools were identified, and a model combining several of these was built. Using the 200 reference sequences, SVM and geno2-pheno showed the highest sensitivity for detecting X4 viruses (98.8% and 93.7%, respectively); however, their specificity was relatively low (62.5% and 86.6%, respectively). For R5 viruses, PSSM and C4.5 gave the same results and outperformed other bioinformatic tools (95.7% sensitivity, 82% specificity). When results from three out of these four tools were concordant, the sensitivity and specificity, taking as reference the results from phenotypic tropism assays, were over 90% in predicting either R5 or X4 viruses (AUC: 0.9701; 95% CI: 0.9358-0.9889).

Such cannot be achieved by utilizing sequence data alone but requires harnessing the three-dimensional (3D) structural properties of AAV capsids. Here, we solve the structures of a natural AAV isolate complexed with antibodies using cryo-electron microscopy and harness this structural information to engineer AAV capsid libraries through saturation mutagenesis of different antigenic footprints. Each surface loop was evolved by infectious cycling in the presence of a helper adenovirus to yield a new AAV variant that then serves as a template for evolving the next surface loop. This stepwise process yielded a humanized AAV8 capsid (AAVhum.8) displaying nonnatural surface loops that simultaneously display tropism for human hepatocytes, increased gene transfer efficiency, and neutralizing antibody evasion. Specifically, AAVhum.8 can better evade neutralizing antisera from multiple species than AAV8. Further, AAVhum.8 displays robust transduction in a human liver xenograft mouse model with expanded tropism for both murine and human hepatocytes. This work supports the hypothesis that critical properties, such as AAV capsid antibody evasion and tropism, can be coevolved by combining rational design and library-based evolution for clinical gene therapy."

Here, we demonstrate that biopsy material from childhood tumors of neural embryonic origin transplanted to mature experimental teratoma can show an exclusive preference for matching tissue. Tumor specimens from five children with; Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET); Pilocytic astrocytoma of the brainstem; Classic medulloblastoma; peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) or neuroblastoma (NB), respectively, were transplanted. Analysis of up to 120 sections of each tumor revealed an engraftment for three of the transplanted tumors: pPNET, sPNET, and NB, with a protruding growth from the latter two that were selected for detailed examination. The histology revealed a strict tropism with a non-random integration into what morphologically appeared as matched embryonic microenvironment recuperating the patient tumor histology.

After exposure to C. chinensis Franch, the macroscopic behavioral index of the remaining rate (RR) on a warm pad (40 degrees C) significantly increased (P<0.05), suggesting the enhancement of Hot tropism.

Approximately 28% of the genes, which include the majority of the genes encoding putative type III secretion system effectors and Inc proteins, present a phylogenetic tree where only lymphogranuloma venereum strains form a clade. Similarly, an exclusive phylogenetic segregation of the most prevalent genital serovars was observed for 61 proteins. Curiously, these serovars are phylogenetically cosegregated with the lymphogranuloma venereum serovars for ~20% of the genes. Some clade-specific pseudogenes were identified (novel findings include the conserved hypothetical protein CT037 and the predicted α-hemolysin CT473), suggesting their putative expendability for the infection of particular niches. Approximately 3.5% of the genes revealed a significant overrepresentation of nonsynonymous mutations, and the majority encode proteins that directly interact with the host. Overall, this in silico scrutiny of genes whose phylogeny is congruent with clinical prevalence or tissue specificity of C. trachomatis strains may constitute an important database of putative targets for future functional studies to evaluate their biological role in chlamydial infections.

The V3 region of HIV-1 was sequenced in triplicate, then tropism predicted using the Geno2Pheno system. Baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months (range 7-81). For 19/26 individuals baseline tropism remained unchanged throughout a median of 54 months follow-up; 18 R5 tropic and 1 X4 tropic. In seven patients (27%) baseline tropism switched at least once (range 1-4 switches) during follow-up; however, their baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 45 months. Co-receptor tropism in treatment-naïve patients with ongoing viral replication appears highly stable over time, suggesting that baseline genotypic tropism prediction may be valid for a longer duration in patients delaying ART initiation. In this study, baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months, suggesting current guidelines recommending repeat testing after 90 days may be excessively conservative in their assessment of tropism stability."

These effects were associated with downregulated donor T cell expression of tissue-specific homing and chemokine receptors, marked reduction of donor T cell migration into GVHD target tissues, and deletion of CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). MLN CD103(+) DCs and peripheral lymph node (PLN) DCs include CCR7(+) and CCR7(-) subsets, but the role of these DC subsets in regulating donor T cell expression of homing and chemokine receptors remain unclear. Here, we show that recipient CCR7(+), but not CCR7(-), DCs in MLN induced donor T cell expression of gut-specific homing and chemokine receptors in a retinoid acid-dependent manner. CCR7 regulated activated DC migration from tissue to draining lymph node, but it was not required for the ability of DCs to induce donor T cell expression of tissue-specific homing and chemokine receptors. Finally, anti-CD3 treatment depleted CCR7(+) but not CCR7(-) DCs by inducing sequential expansion and apoptosis of CCR7(+) DCs in MLN and PLN. Apoptosis of CCR7(+) DCs was associated with DC upregulation of Fas expression and natural killer cell but not T, B, or dendritic cell upregulation of FasL expression in the lymph nodes. These results suggest that depletion of CCR7(+) host-type DCs, with subsequent inhibition of donor T cell migration into GVHD target tissues, can be an effective approach in prevention of acute GVHD and preservation of GVL effects."

Closely related Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis elaborate the pH6 antigen (Psa), which mediates bacterial attachment to alveolar cells of the lung. Y. enterocolitica, instead, assembles the homologous fimbriae Myf of unknown function. Here, we discovered that Myf, like Psa, specifically recognizes β1-3- or β1-4-linked galactose in glycosphingolipids, but completely lacks affinity for phosphatidylcholine, the main receptor for Psa in alveolar cells. The crystal structure of a subunit of Psa (PsaA) complexed with choline together with mutagenesis experiments revealed that PsaA has four phosphatidylcholine binding pockets that enable super-high-avidity binding of Psa-fibres to cell membranes. The pockets are arranged as six tyrosine residues, which are all missing in the MyfA subunit of Myf. Conversely, the crystal structure of the MyfA-galactose complex revealed that the galactose-binding site is more extended in MyfA, enabling tighter binding to lactosyl moieties. Our results suggest that during evolution, Psa has acquired a tyrosine-rich surface that enables it to bind to phosphatidylcholine and mediate adhesion of Y. pestis/pseudotuberculosis to alveolar cells, whereas Myf has specialized as a carbohydrate-binding adhesin, facilitating the attachment of Y. enterocolitica to intestinal cells."

The development of a protocol that allows sorting reticulocytes into defined developmental stages and a robust ex vivo P vivax invasion assay has made it possible for the first time to investigate the fine-scale invasion preference of P vivax merozoites. Surprisingly, it was the immature reticulocytes (CD71(+)) that are generally restricted to the bone marrow that were preferentially invaded, whereas older reticulocytes (CD71(-)), principally found in the peripheral blood, were rarely invaded. Invasion assays based on the CD71(+) reticulocyte fraction revealed substantial postinvasion modification. Thus, 3 to 6 hours after invasion, the initially biomechanically rigid CD71(+) reticulocytes convert into a highly deformable CD71(-) infected red blood cell devoid of host reticular matter, a process that normally spans 24 hours for uninfected reticulocytes. Concurrent with these changes, clathrin pits disappear by 3 hours postinvasion, replaced by distinctive caveolae nanostructures. These 2 hitherto unsuspected features of P vivax invasion, a narrow preference for immature reticulocytes and a rapid remodeling of the host cell, provide important insights pertinent to the pathobiology of the P vivax infection.

Our work aimed to obtain and characterize human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) and detect their ovarian cancer tropsim in nude mice model. Ten milliliters of twenty independent amniotic fluid samples were collected from 16-20 week pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis for fetal genetic determination in routine prenatal diagnosis in the first affiliated hospital of Harbin medical university. We successfully isolated the AFMSCs from thirteen of twenty amniotic fluid samples. AFMSCs presented a fibroblastic-like morphology during the culture. Flow cytometry analyses showed that the cells were positive for specific stem cell markers CD73,CD90, CD105, CD166 and HLA-ABC (MHC class I), but negative for CD 45,CD40, CD34, CD14 and HLA-DR (MHC class II). RT-PCR results showed that the AFMSCs expressed stem cell marker OCT4. AFMSCs could differentiate into bone cells, fat cells and chondrocytes under certain conditions. AFMSCs had the high motility to migrate to ovarian cancer site but didn't have the tumorigenicity. This study enhances the possibility of AFMSCs as drug carrier in human cell-based therapy. Meanwhile, the research emphasis in the future can also put in targeting therapy of ovarian cancer. "

Their utility and accessibility have led to the rapid development of clinical investigations to explore their autologous and allogeneic cellular-based regenerative potential, tissue preservation capabilities, anti-inflammatory properties, and anticancer properties, among others. hAMSCs are typically cultured under ambient conditions with 21% oxygen. However, physiologically, hAMSCs exist in an environment of much lower oxygen tension. Furthermore, hAMSCs cultured in standard conditions have shown limited proliferative and migratory capabilities, as well as limited viability. This study investigated the effects hypoxic culture conditions have on primary intraoperatively derived hAMSCs. hAMSCs cultured under hypoxia (hAMSCs-H) remained multipotent, capable of differentiation into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages. In addition, hAMSCs-H grew faster and exhibited less cell death. Furthermore, hAMSCs-H had greater motility than normoxia-cultured hAMSCs and exhibited greater homing ability to glioblastoma (GBM) derived from brain tumor-initiating cells from our patients in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, hAMSCs-H did not transform into tumor-associated fibroblasts in vitro and were not tumorigenic in vivo. Rather, hAMSCs-H promoted the differentiation of brain cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest an alternative culturing technique that can enhance the function of hAMSCs, which may be necessary for their use in the treatment of various pathologies including stroke, myocardial infarction, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and GBM.

T cells acquire a gut-homing phenotype dependent on retinoic acid (RA) provided by intestinal dendritic cells (DC). We investigated whether liver antigen-presenting cells can induce gut tropism supporting an enterohepatic lymphocyte circulation. Priming of CD4(+) T cells by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) supported migration into gut and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. As observed for T cells primed by intestinal DCs, this gut tropism depended on α(4) β(7) integrin and CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) expression by LSEC-primed CD4(+) T cells. The induction of gut-homing molecules was mediated by RA, a derivate of vitamin A that is stored in large amounts within the liver. LSECs expressed functional retinal dehydrogenases and could convert vitamin A to RA. Conversely, the lack of signaling via the RA receptor prevented the expression of α(4) β(7) integrin and CCR9 on LSEC-primed CD4(+) T cells, consequently reducing their in vivo migration to the intestine. Other liver antigen-presenting cells failed to support high expression of α(4) β(7) integrin on CD4(+) T cells, thus, the potential to induce gut homing is restricted to LSECs."

By alanine scanning mutagenesis, we showed that the KR region influences pathogenicity and virulence of OuMV without altering viral particle assembly. A mutant, called OuMV6710, with three basic residue substitutions in the KR region, was impaired in the ability to maintain the initial systemic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana and to infect both cucumber and melon plants systemically. The integrity of this protein region was also crucial for encapsidation of viral genomic RNA; in fact, certain mutations within the KR region partially compromised the RNA encapsidation efficiency of the CP. In Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, OuMV6710 was impaired in particle accumulation; however, this phenotype was abolished in dcl2/dcl4 and dcl2/dcl3/dcl4 Arabidopsis mutants defective for antiviral silencing. Moreover, in contrast to CPwt, in situ immunolocalization experiments indicated that CP6710 accumulates efficiently in the spongy mesophyll tissue of infected N. benthamiana and A. thaliana leaves but only occasionally infects palisade tissues. These results provided strong evidence of a crucial role for OuMV CP during viral infection and highlighted the relevance of the KR region in determining tissue tropism, host range, pathogenicity, and RNA affinity, which may be all correlated with a possible CP silencing-suppression activity."

We found that CCL5 was expressed in a significantly higher percentage of lymphocytes in lymphomas compared with those in LEP (P < 0.01).

We observed direct internalization of CCL5-positive lymphocytes within adipocytes based on ultrastructural studies. This study shows that the basis of the adipocyte tropism may reflect a unique interaction between CCL5-positive lymphocytes and CCR5 positive adipocytes. Given the known pharmacologic inhibitors of CCR5-expression one might propose that using such inhibitors (ie, anti-CCR5) could be of therapeutic value in select cases."

Inoculation of the organism at a cutaneous mite bite site commonly results in formation of a localized pathological skin reaction termed an eschar. The site of development of the obligate intracellular bacteria within the eschar and the mechanisms of dissemination to cause systemic infection are unclear. Previous postmortem and in vitro reports demonstrated infection of endothelial cells, but recent pathophysiological investigations of typhus patients using surrogate markers of endothelial cell and leucocyte activation indicated a more prevalent host leucocyte than endothelial cell response in vivo. We therefore examined eschar skin biopsies from patients with scrub typhus to determine and characterize the phenotypes of host cells in vivo with intracellular infection by O. tsutsugamushi, using histology, immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping of host leucocytes infected with O. tsutsugamushi showed a tropism for host monocytes and dendritic cells, which were spatially related to different histological zones of the eschar. Infected leucocyte subsets were characterized by expression of HLADR+, with an ""inflammatory"" monocyte phenotype of CD14/LSP-1/CD68 positive or dendritic cell phenotype of CD1a/DCSIGN/S100/FXIIIa and CD163 positive staining, or occasional CD3 positive T-cells. Endothelial cell infection was rare, and histology did not indicate a widespread inflammatory vasculitis as the cause of the eschar. Infection of dendritic cells and activated inflammatory monocytes offers a potential route for dissemination of O. tsutsugamushi from the initial eschar site. This newly described cellular tropism for O. tsutsugamushi may influence its interaction with local host immune responses."

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is one of the most promising candidates for cancer gene therapy. Here, we show that tumor irradiation enhances the tumor tropism of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs) and the therapeutic effect of TRAIL delivered by UCB-MSCs. The sequential treatment with irradiation followed by TRAIL-secreting UCB-MSCs (MSC-TRAIL) synergistically enhanced apoptosis in either TRAIL-sensitive or TRAIL-resistant glioma cells by upregulating the death receptor 5 and by inducing caspase activation. Migration assays showed greater MSC migration toward irradiated glioma cells and the tumor site in glioma-bearing mice compared with unirradiated tumors. Irradiated glioma cells had increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which leads to the upregulation of the IL-8 receptor on MSCs. This upregulation, which is involved in the migratory capacity of UCB-MSCs, was confirmed by siRNA inhibition and an antibody-neutralizing assay. In vivo survival experiments in orthotopic xenografted mice showed that MSC-based TRAIL gene delivery to irradiated tumors had greater therapeutic efficacy than a single treatment. These results suggest that clinically relevant tumor irradiation increases the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-TRAIL by increasing tropism of MSCs and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which may be a more useful strategy for cancer gene therapy."

We sought to identify sustained switches in host tropism in the S. aureus population, both anthroponotic and zoonotic, and their distribution over the species phylogeny. METHODOLOGIES/RESULTS: We have used a sample of 3042 isolates, representing 696 distinct MLST genotypes, from a well-established database (www.mlst.net). Using an empirical parsimony approach (AdaptML) we have investigated the distribution of switches in host association between both human and non-human (henceforth referred to as animal) hosts. We reconstructed a credible description of past events in the form of a phylogenetic tree; the nodes and leaves of which are statistically associated with either human or animal habitats, estimated from extant host-association and the degree of sequence divergence between genotypes. We identified 15 likely historical switching events; 13 anthroponoses and two zoonoses. Importantly, we identified two human-associated clade candidates (CC25 and CC59) that have arisen from animal-associated ancestors; this demonstrates that a human-specific lineage can emerge from an animal host. We also highlight novel rabbit-associated genotypes arising from a human ancestor."

Being zoonotic, Flaviviruses infect a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates, which dependent of the virus-host interactions, can enhance ongoing epidemics and maintain the virus in the environment for prolonged periods. Targeted species can vary from amphibians, birds to various mammals, dependent on the virus. For many mosquito-borne flaviviruses the spectrum of targeted species is incompletely understood, in particular with respect to their contribution to the maintenance of virus in certain geographical regions. Furthermore, little is known about virus and host factors contributing to species tropism. The present study utilized human and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) as a cell culture model to better understand Flavivirus species tropism and innate immune responses. MoDC were selected based on their presence in the skin and their role as an early target cell for several Flaviviruses and their role as immune sentinels. While differences in viral infectivity and replication were minor when comparing porcine with human MoDC for some of the tested Flaviviruses, a particularly strong replication in human MoDC was found with USUV, while JEV appeared to have a stronger tropism for porcine MoDC. With respect to innate immune responses we found high induction of TNF and IFN-β in both human and porcine MoDC after infection with JEV, WNV, and USUV, but not with DENV, ZIKV, and Wesselsbron virus. Spondweni virus induced these cytokine responses only in porcine MoDC. Overall, innate immune responses correlated with early infectivity and cytokine production. In conclusion, we demonstrate Flavivirus-dependent differences in the interaction with MoDC. These may play a role in pathogenesis but appear to only partially reflect the expected species tropism."

Here, we examined the roles of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus surface spike proteins for membrane fusion, using the spike proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as the model system. To this end, we controlled the contributions from receptor binding and other host proteases, thereby attributing coronavirus entry solely or mainly to the efficiency of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion. Our results showed that lysosomal proteases from bat cells support coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus entry and cell-cell fusion more effectively than their counterparts from human cells. Moreover, purified lysosomal extracts from bat cells cleave cell surface-expressed coronavirus spikes more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells.

The lipophilic chain can self-assemble and infuse with the cytomembrane of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with the end of FA left on the outside for targeting. The polymer tailored BMSCs can enhance tumor tropism in gastric cancer. BMSCs are characterized by the low immunogenicity and tumor tropism, which makes them promising targeting carriers. Regarding the integrated advantages of these two vectors, it is demonstrated that the functional amphiphilic AHP-OA-FA enhances the tumor tropism of BMSCs. Flow cytometry, standard MTT assay, and wound-healing assay show that AHP-OA-FA has no influence on CD expression, proliferative capacity, and cell motility of BMSCs, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro transwell assay and ex vivo fluorescence image verify that AHP-OA-FA enhances tumor tropism of BMSCs compared to BMSCs and AHP-OA-Rhodamine B-BMSCs. Finally, histological analysis demonstrates that AHP-OA-FA causes no damage to major organs.

The most common infections involve the throat (pharyngitis) or skin (impetigo); however, the factors that determine tissue tropism and severity are incompletely understood. The S. pyogenes NAD(+) glycohydrolase (SPN) is a virulence factor that has been implicated in contributing to the pathogenesis of severe infections. However, the role of SPN in determining the bacterium's tissue tropism has not been evaluated. In this report, we examine the sequences of spn and its endogenous inhibitor ifs from a worldwide collection of S. pyogenes strains. Analysis of average pairwise nucleotide diversity, average number of nucleotide differences, and ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions revealed significant diversity in spn and ifs. Application of established models of molecular evolution shows that SPN is evolving under positive selection and diverging into NAD(+) glycohydrolase (NADase)-active and -inactive subtypes. Additionally, the NADase-inactive SPN subtypes maintain the characteristics of a functional gene while ifs becomes a pseudogene. Thus, NADase-inactive SPN continues to evolve under functional constraint. Furthermore, NADase activity did not correlate with invasive disease in our collection but was associated with tissue tropism. The ability to cause infection at both the pharynx and the skin (""generalist"" strains) is correlated with NADase-active SPN, while the preference for causing infection at either the throat or the skin (""specialist"" strains) is associated with NADase-inactive SPN. These findings suggest that SPN has a NADase-independent function and prompt a reevaluation of the role of SPN in streptococcal pathogenesis."

This is particularly illustrated over the last 15 years by the emergence of two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Due to their inherent genetic variability, it is inevitable that new cross-species transmission events of these enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses will occur. Research into these medical and veterinary important pathogens-sparked by the SARS and MERS outbreaks-revealed important principles of inter- and intraspecies tropism changes. The primary determinant of CoV tropism is the viral spike (S) entry protein. Trimers of the S glycoproteins on the virion surface accommodate binding to a cell surface receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Recently, high-resolution structures of two CoV S proteins have been elucidated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Using this new structural insight, we review the changes in the S protein that relate to changes in virus tropism. Different concepts underlie these tropism changes at the cellular, tissue, and host species level, including the promiscuity or adaptability of S proteins to orthologous receptors, alterations in the proteolytic cleavage activation as well as changes in the S protein metastability. A thorough understanding of the key role of the S protein in CoV entry is critical to further our understanding of virus cross-species transmission and pathogenesis and for development of intervention strategies."

To improve tropism prediction accuracy, we developed two novel methods, the extreme gradient boosting based XGBpred and the hidden Markov model based HMMpred. Both XGBpred and HMMpred achieved higher specificities (72.56% and 72.09%) than the state-of-the-art methods Geno2pheno (61.6%) and G2p_str (68.60%) in a 10-fold cross validation test at the same sensitivity of 93.73%. Moreover, XGBpred had more outstanding performances (with AUCs 0.9483, 0.9464) than HMMpred (0.8829, 0.8774) on the Hivcopred and Newdb (created in this work) datasets containing larger proportions of hard-to-predict dual tropic samples in the X4-using tropic samples. Therefore, we recommend the use of our novel method XGBpred to predict tropism. The two methods and datasets are available via http://spg.med.tsinghua.edu.cn:23334/XGBpred/. In addition, our models identified that positions 5, 11, 13, 18, 22, 24, and 25 were correlated with HIV-1 tropism."

The choroid plexus (CP) is an important target for gene therapy of neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. However, viral tropism in CP has not been well studied as a result of limited viral vector applications. To identify CP-specific viral vectors, we intracerebroventricularly administered six different serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (AAV2/1, AAV2/5, AAV2/8, AAV2/9, AAV2-BR1, and AAV2-PHP.eB) and lentivirus in adult mice. Tropism in CP was compared among these viruses. We found that AAV2/5 and AAV2/8 displayed remarkable infections in CP, while AAV2/1 infected both ependymal cells and cells in the CP. Except for the low infection intensity of AAV2/9 and lentivirus in the CP, no infection intensity was found for CP tissues injected with AAV2-BR1 or AAV2-PHP.eB. Green fluorescence protein expression in the CP after AAV2/5 infection was confirmed by Western blotting. AAV2/5-mediated tropism in epithelial cells of the CP was verified by immunostaining with transthyretin. In this study, we identified for the first time that serotype-specific AAVs 5 and 8 may be robust research tools for intracerebroventricular gene delivery."

It is characterized by genetic instability and different antigenic properties. The nonstructural protein 3A is a primary determinant of the tropism and virulence of Cathay topotype FMDVs. However, several other determinants are also speculated to be involved in viral tropism and virulence. Deletion of 43 nucleotides (nt) in the pseudoknot (PK) region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) has been found to coexist with the identified 3A deletion in Cathay topotype FMDV genomes. In this study, we isolated an O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage FMDV strain, O/GD/CHA/2015, that includes an 86-nt deletion in the PK region and shows a porcinophilic phenotype. To investigate the potential role of the PK region in viral pathogenicity, we generated a recombinant FMDV strain with an incomplete PK region and compared its virulence and pathogenesis to the intact FMDV strain in swine and bovines. Deletion of the 86 nt in the PKs had no major effects on the pathogenicity of the virus in swine but significantly attenuated its ability to infect bovine cells and cattle, indicating that the PK region is a newly discovered determinant of viral tropism and virulence. The role of the 43-nt deletion existing in the Cathay topotype FMDV was also investigated by evaluating the infection properties of genetically engineered viruses. Consistently, the 43-nt deletion in the PK region significantly decreased the pathogenicity of the virus in bovines. Overall, our findings suggest that the PK region deletion occurred naturally in the FMDV genome and that the PK region is highly associated with viral host range and functions as a novel determinant for FMDV pathogenesis."

Fourteen different tissues per bird were investigated by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the parasites' DNA. T. gondii DNA was found in any type of tissue analysed; in 86.1 % of all infected birds, at least one sample was tested positive. Over all intravenously infected birds, 15.4 % of all analysed samples contained T. gondii DNA. Most frequently affected tissues were liver (43.3 % positive samples), breast muscle (26.7 % positive samples) and heart (20.0 % positive samples), while the brain was less frequently positive (6.7 %). The number of positive tissues varied from zero to seven tissues per animal with at least one T. gondii-positive edible tissue sample in 80 % of all intravenously infected birds. Still, the results did not indicate defined target tissues or a cyst distribution pattern. Nonetheless, edible organs were most frequently parasitised.

Recent studies have shown that mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix can drive the transition to a malignant phenotype. Moreover, it is also known that the metastatic process, which results in over 90% of cancer-related deaths, is governed by intracellular mechanical forces. To better understand these processes, we identified metastatic tumor cells originating from different locations which undergo inverse responses to altered matrix elasticity: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that prefer rigid matrices and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells that prefer compliant matrices as characterized by parameters such as tumor cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and migration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed higher expression of genes associated with cytoskeletal tension and contractility in cells that prefer stiff environments, both when comparing MDA-MB-231 to SKOV-3 cells as well as when comparing bone-metastatic to lung-metastatic MDA-MB-231 subclones. Using small molecule inhibitors, we found that blocking the activity of these pathways mitigated rigidity-dependent behavior in both cell lines. Probing the physical forces exerted by cells on the underlying substrates revealed that though force magnitude may not directly correlate with functional outcomes, other parameters such as force polarization do correlate directly with cell motility. Finally, this biophysical analysis demonstrates that intrinsic levels of cell contractility determine the matrix rigidity for maximal cell function, possibly influencing tissue sites for metastatic cancer cell engraftment during dissemination. By increasing our understanding of the physical interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment, these studies may help develop novel therapeutic strategies. "

This distinct tissue selectivity makes them ideal tools with which to study the pathogenesis of betaretroviruses. To uncover the genetic determinants of tropism, we constructed JSRV-ENTV chimeric viruses and produced lentivectors pseudotyped with the Env proteins from JSRV (Jenv) and ENTV (Eenv). Through the transduction and infection of lung and nasal turbinate tissue slices, we observed that Hyal2 expression levels strongly influence ENTV entry, but that the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoters of these viruses are likely responsible for tissue-specificity. Furthermore, we show evidence of ENTV Env expression in chondrocytes within ENTV-infected nasal turbinate tissue, where Hyal2 is highly expressed. Our work suggests that the unique tissue tropism of JSRV and ENTV stems from the combined effort of the envelope glycoprotein-receptor interactions and the LTR and provides new insight into the pathogenesis of ENTV."

We evaluated the association of HIV-1 tropism prediction with clinical and laboratory outcome of 73 children with HIV/AIDS in São Paulo, Brazil.

Several clinical strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have been cloned as BACs; however, no low passage strains of murine CMV (MCMV), which provide a model mimicking these isolates, have been cloned. Here the low passage G4 strain of was BAC cloned. G4 encodes a m157 gene that does not ligate the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor, Ly49H, meaning that unlike laboratory strains of MCMV, this virus replicates well in C57BL/6 mice. This BAC clone exhibited normal replication during acute infection in the spleen and liver but was attenuated for salivary gland tropism. Next-generation sequencing revealed a C to A mutation at nucleotide position 188 422, located in the 3' untranslated region of sgg1, a spliced gene critical for salivary gland tropism. Repair of this mutation restored tropism for the salivary glands. Transcriptional analysis revealed a novel spliced gene within the sgg1 locus. This small ORF, sgg1.1, starts at the 3' end of the first exon of sgg1 and extends exon two of sgg1. This shorter spliced gene is prematurely terminated by the nonsense mutation at nt 188 422. Sequence analysis of tissue culture passaged virus demonstrated that sgg1.1 was stable, although other mutational hotspots were identified. The G4 BAC will allow in vivo studies in a broader range of mice, avoiding strong the NK cell responses seen in B6 mice with other MCMV BAC-derived MCMVs."

The development of effective gene therapy requires an understanding of the vector's tissue-specific behavior, which may vary depending on serotype, route of delivery, or target species. Using an ex vivo organotypic explant system, we previously demonstrated that retinal tropism and transduction of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) varies significantly depending on serotype in human eyes. However, the ex vivo system has limited ability to assess route of ocular delivery, and relatively little literature exists on tropic differences between serotypes and routes of delivery in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that retinal tropism and transduction efficiency of five different AAV2 serotypes (AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, AAV2/9) expressing eGFP driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter vary greatly depending on serotype and route of delivery (intravitreal, subretinal, or suprachoroidal) in rats. With subretinal delivery, all serotypes successfully transduced the retinal pigmented epithelium and outer nuclear layer (ONL), with AAV2/1 displaying the highest transduction efficiency and AAV2/2 and AAV2/6 showing lower ONL transduction. There was minimal transduction of the inner retina via subretinal delivery for any serotype. Tropism by suprachoroidal delivery mirrored that of subretinal delivery for all AAV serotypes but resulted in a wider distribution and greater ONL transduction. With intravitreal delivery, retinal transduction was seen primarily in the inner retina (retinal nerve fiber, ganglion cell, and inner nuclear layers) for AAV2/1 and AAV2/6, with AAV2/6 showing the highest transduction. When compared to data from human explant models, there are substantial differences in tropism and transduction that are important to consider when using rats as preclinical models for the development of ocular gene therapies for humans."

Due to the fact that the CCR5 coreceptor is targeted by entry inhibitors, a reliable prediction of the coreceptor usage of HIV-1 is of great interest for antiretroviral therapy. Although several methods for the prediction of coreceptor tropism are available, almost all of them have been developed based on only subtype B sequences, and it has been shown in several studies that the prediction of non-B sequences, in particular subtype A sequences, are less reliable. Thus, the aim of the current study was to develop a reliable prediction model for subtype A viruses."

Our group and others have reported the presence of highly macrophage-tropic R5 variants of HIV-1 in brain tissue of patients with neurological complications. These variants are able to exploit low amounts of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection and potentially confer an expanded tropism for any cell types that express low CD4 and/or CCR5. In contrast to the brain-derived envelopes, we found that envelopes from lymph node tissue, blood, or semen were predominantly non-macrophage-tropic and required high amounts of CD4 for infection. Nevertheless, where tested, the non-macrophage-tropic envelopes conferred efficient replication in primary CD4(+) T-cell cultures. Determinants of R5 macrophage tropism appear to involve changes in the CD4 binding site, although further unknown determinants are also involved. The variation of R5 envelopes also affects their sensitivity to inhibition by ligands and entry inhibitors that target CD4 and CCR5. In summary, HIV-1 R5 viruses vary extensively in macrophage tropism. In the brain, highly macrophage-tropic variants may represent neurotropic or neurovirulent viruses. In addition, variation in R5 macrophage tropism may also have implications (1) for transmission, depending on what role macrophages or cells that express low CD4 and/or CCR5 play in the establishment of infection in a new host, and (2) for pathogenesis and depletion of CD4(+) T cells (i.e., do highly macrophage-tropic variants confer a broader tropism among CD4(+) T-cell populations late in disease and contribute to their depletion?)."

One of the common pathogens involved is canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), however little is known regarding its pathogenesis and the role it plays in the development of CIRD. The pathogenesis of five geographically unrelated canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) isolates was investigated. Following experimental infection in dogs, all five CRCoV isolates gave rise to clinical signs of respiratory disease consistent with that observed during natural infection. The presence of CRCoV was associated with marked histopathological changes in the nares and trachea, with loss and damage to tracheal cilia, accompanied by inflammation. Viral shedding was readily detected from the oropharynx up to 10 days post infection, but there was little or no evidence of rectal shedding. The successful re-isolation of CRCoV from a wide range of respiratory and mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, and lung lavage fluids demonstrates a clear tropism of CRCoV for respiratory tissues and fulfils the final requirement for Koch's postulates. By study day 14 dogs had seroconverted to CRCoV and the antibodies raised were neutralising against both homologous and heterologous strains of CRCoV in vitro, thus demonstrating antigenic homogeneity among CRCoV strains from the two continents. Defining the role that CRCoV and other agents play in CIRD is a considerable, but important, challenge if the disease is to be managed, treated and prevented more successfully. Here we have successfully developed a model for studying the pathogenicity and the role of CRCoV in CIRD."

Among the available methods, geno2pheno[coreceptor] (G2P) is the most used online tool for tropism prediction. This study was conceived to assess if the combination of G2P prediction with V3 peptide net charge (NC) value could improve the accuracy of tropism prediction. A total of 172 V3 bulk sequences from 143 patients were analyzed by G2P and NC values. A phenotypic assay was performed by cloning the complete env gene and tropism determination was assessed on U87_CCR5(+)/CXCR4(+) cells. Sequences were stratified according to the agreement between NC values and G2P results. Of sequences predicted as X4 by G2P, 61% showed NC values higher than 5; similarly, 76% of sequences predicted as R5 by G2P had NC values below 4. Sequences with NC values between 4 and 5 were associated with different G2P predictions: 65% of samples were predicted as R5-tropic and 35% of sequences as X4-tropic. Sequences identified as X4 by NC value had at least one positive residue at positions known to be involved in tropism prediction and positive residues in position 32. These data supported the hypothesis that NC values between 4 and 5 could be associated with the presence of dual/mixed-tropic (DM) variants. The phenotypic assay performed on a subset of sequences confirmed the tropism prediction for concordant sequences and showed that NC values between 4 and 5 are associated with DM tropism. These results suggest that the combination of G2P and NC could increase the accuracy of tropism prediction. A more reliable identification of X4 variants would be useful for better selecting candidates for Maraviroc (MVC) administration, but also as a predictive marker in coreceptor switching, strongly associated with the phase of infection."

In vitro studies showed that both viruses diminished their infectivity on non-muscle cell lines as well as on un-differentiated myoblasts; however, preserved or enhanced their infectivity on differentiated myotubes. AAV(587)MTP, but not AAV(588)MTP, also abolished its heparin-binding capacity and infected myotubes in a heparin-independent manner.

This alteration of tissue tropism is not simply because of the loss of heparin-binding, as a mutant AAV2 (AAVHBSMut) containing heparin-binding site mutations lost infectivity on both non-muscle and muscle cells. Furthermore, free MTP peptide, but not the scrambled control peptide, competitively inhibited AAV(587)MTP infection on myotubes.

However, intravasal coagulation and subsequent consumption coagulopathy can only partly explain the sequence of events leading to hemorrhagic diathesis manifesting as cyanosis, petechial bleeding, and ecchymosis, and to disseminated coagulation. The involvement of endothelial activation and damage in M. suis-associated pathogenesis was investigated using light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cell sorting. M. suis interacted directly with endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial activation, widespread endothelial damage, and adherence of red blood cells to the endothelium were evident in M. suis-infected pigs. These alterations of the endothelium were accompanied by hemorrhage, intravascular coagulation, vascular occlusion, and massive morphological changes within the parenchyma. M. suis biofilm-like microcolonies formed on the surface of endothelial cells, and may represent a putative persistence mechanism of M. suis. In vitro analysis demonstrated that M. suis interacted with the endothelial cytoskeletal protein actin, and induced actin condensation and activation of endothelial cells, as determined by the up-regulation of ICAM, PECAM, E-selectin, and P-selectin. These findings demonstrate an additional cell tropism of HM for endothelial cells and suggest that M. suis interferes with the protective function of the endothelium, resulting in hemorrhagic diathesis."

Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR analyses in prototype and clinical strains covering the three disease groups identified three inc genes with LGV-specific expression. We determined the transcriptional start sites of these genes and found LGV-specific nucleotides within their promoters. Thus, subtle variations in the amino acids of a subset of Inc proteins and in the expression of inc genes may contribute to the unique tropism and invasiveness of C. trachomatis LGV strains."

The results indicated that the COLD nature Zuojinwan could decrease significantly the remaining rate of HOT-symptom rat on warm pad (P < 0.05). That was not notable to COLD-symptom rat. The interference result of COLD-HOT temperature tropism to COLD/HOT symptom rat in Fanzuojinwan was the reverse with the COLD nature Zuojinwan. Meanwhile, biochemical indicators which are relative to energy metabolism such as ATPase enzyme activity and total anti-oxidant capability (T-AOC), had corresponding change in the organism.

VSV's broad cell tropism makes it a popular model virus for many basic research applications. In addition, a lack of preexisting human immunity against VSV, inherent oncotropism and other features make VSV a widely used platform for vaccine and oncolytic vectors. However, VSV's neurotropism that can result in viral encephalitis in experimental animals needs to be addressed for the use of the virus as a safe vector. Therefore, it is very important to understand the determinants of VSV tropism and develop strategies to alter it. VSV glycoprotein (G) and matrix (M) protein play major roles in its cell tropism. VSV G protein is responsible for VSV broad cell tropism and is often used for pseudotyping other viruses. VSV M affects cell tropism via evasion of antiviral responses, and M mutants can be used to limit cell tropism to cell types defective in interferon signaling. In addition, other VSV proteins and host proteins may function as determinants of VSV cell tropism. Various approaches have been successfully used to alter VSV tropism to benefit basic research and clinically relevant applications."

Given the structure of the placenta, the PC is potentially an important neutralizing antibody target antigen against congenital infection. The guinea pig is the only small animal model for congenital CMV. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) potentially encodes a UL128-131 HCMV PC homolog locus (GP128-GP133). In transient expression studies, GPCMV gH and gL glycoproteins interacted with UL128, UL130 and UL131 homolog proteins (designated GP129 and GP131 and GP133 respectively) to form PC or subcomplexes which were determined by immunoprecipitation reactions directed to gH or gL. A natural GP129 C-terminal deletion mutant (aa 107-179) and a chimeric HCMV UL128 C-terminal domain swap GP129 mutant failed to form PC with other components. GPCMV infection of a newly established guinea pig epithelial cell line required a complete PC and a GP129 mutant virus lacked epithelial tropism and was attenuated in the guinea pig for pathogenicity and had a low congenital transmission rate. Individual knockout of GP131 or 133 genes resulted in loss of viral epithelial tropism. A GP128 mutant virus retained epithelial tropism and GP128 was determined not to be a PC component. A series of GPCMV mutants demonstrated that gO was not strictly essential for epithelial infection whereas gB and the PC were essential. Ectopic expression of a GP129 cDNA in a GP129 mutant virus restored epithelial tropism, pathogenicity and congenital infection. Overall, GPCMV forms a PC similar to HCMV which enables evaluation of PC based vaccine strategies in the guinea pig model."

Although the trial was stopped prematurely due to idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, eight subjects met protocol-defined virologic failure criteria. Clonal analyses of the viral envelope tropism, aplaviroc susceptibility, and env sequencing were performed on plasma at baseline and at the time of virologic failure. Molecular evolutionary analyses were also performed. The majority of the subjects with virologic failure (six of eight) acquired the lamivudine resistance-associated mutation M184V, and none had evidence of reduced susceptibility to aplaviroc at the time of virologic failure, even at the clonal level. Six subjects with virologic failure maintained CCR5 tropism, while two exhibited a change in population tropism readout to dual/mixed-tropic with R5X4-tropic clones detected prior to therapy. Two evolutionary patterns were observed: five subjects had no evidence of population turnover, while three subjects had multiple lines of evidence for env population turnover. The acquisition of the M184V mutation is the primary characteristic of virologic failure in first-line therapy with aplaviroc plus lamivudine-zidovudine, regardless of the envelope tropism."

In current research, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of hepatic tropism of HCV infection. Although non-hepatic cells could not permit replication of HCV RNA, exogenous expression of liver specific miRNA, miR-122 facilitated efficient replication of viral RNA through direct interaction with 5'UTR of viral genome, indicating that miR-122 is one of the key determinants for hepatic tropism of HCV infection. In spite of efficient replication of viral RNA, formation of infectious particles was not observed in non-hepatic cells exogenously expressing miR-122. We found that expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) facilitated the formation of infectious HCV particles in non-hepatic cells, indicating that not only miR-122 but also ApoE participate in tissue tropism of HCV infection. To understand the exact roles of miR-122 and apolipoproteins in hepatic tropism of HCV, we established miR-122 and ApoB/ApoE knockout (KO) Huh7 cells, respectively. Although slight increase of intracellular HCV RNA and infectious titers in the culture supernatants was observed, propagation of HCV was impaired in miR-122 KO Huh7 cells. After serial passages of HCV in miR-122 KO cells, we obtained an adaptive mutant that possessed G28A substitutions in the 5'UTR of the HCV genome and exhibited efficient translation and replication in both miR-122 KO Huh7 and non-hepatic cells without exogenous expression of miR-122. These results suggest that HCV mutants replicating in non-hepatic cells in an miR-122-independent manner participate in the induction of extrahepatic manifestations in chronic hepatitis C patients. Deficiency of both ApoB and ApoE strongly inhibited the formation of infectious HCV particles. Interestingly, expression not only of ApoE but also of ApoA or ApoC could rescue the production of infectious HCV particles in ApoB/ApoE KO cells, suggesting that exchangeable apolipoproteins redundantly participate in the formation of infectious HCV particles."

However, vaginal cancer is an order of magnitude less common than cervical cancer, not only in the general population but also among women with HIV/AIDS. It is interesting therefore that recent studies found that HPV was common in both normal vaginal and cervical tissue, with higher prevalence of nononcogenic HPV types in the vagina. In our investigation, we prospectively examined HPV infection in 86 HIV-positive and 17 HIV-negative women who underwent hysterectomy during follow-up in a longitudinal cohort. Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were obtained semi-annually and tested for HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction. To address possible selection biases associated with having a hysterectomy, subjects acted as their own comparison group--before versus after hysterectomy. The average HPV prevalence was higher in HIV-positive than HIV-negative women both before (59% vs. 12%; p < 0.001) and after hysterectomy (56% vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Multivariate random effects models (within-individual comparisons) demonstrated significantly lower HPV prevalence [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-0.85) after hysterectomy. The association of HPV prevalence with hysterectomy was similar among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. However, hysterectomy had greater effects on oncogenic (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.35-0.66) than nononcogenic HPV types (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.71-1.11; P(interaction) = 0.002). Overall, we observed greater reductions in oncogenic than nononcogenic HPV prevalence after hysterectomy. If correct, these data could suggest that oncogenic HPV have greater tropism for cervical compared to vaginal epithelium, consistent with the lower incidence of vaginal than cervical cancer."

As such, automatic prediction of host tropism from analysis of genomic information is of considerable utility. Previous research has applied machine learning methods to accomplish this task, although deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural network, CNN) techniques have not yet been applied. These techniques have the ability to learn how to recognize critical hierarchical structures within the genome in a data-driven manner. We designed deep CNN models to identify host tropism for human and avian influenza A viruses based on protein sequences and performed a detailed analysis of the results. Our findings show that deep CNN techniques work as well as existing approaches (with 99% mean accuracy on the binary prediction task) while performing end-to-end learning of the prediction model (without the need to specify handcrafted features). The findings also show that these models, combined with standard principal component analysis, can be used to quantify and visualize viral strain similarity."

A major limitation of viral techniques is that they rely on cell-type-specific molecules for uptake and transport. Consequently, viruses fail to infect variable subsets of neurons depending on the complement of surface receptors expressed (viral tropism). We report a receptor complementation strategy to overcome this by potentiating neurons for the infection of the virus of interest-in this case, canine adenovirus type-2 (CAV-2). We designed AAV vectors for expressing the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) throughout candidate projection neurons.

To study the factors associated with tumor invasion, we established a new murine brain tumor model, ALTS1C1 derived from SV40 large T antigen-transfected astrocytes. This new brain tumor model recapitulates several histopathological features of human high-grade glioma including increased cellularity, prominent cellular pleomorphism, geographic necrosis, active mitosis, and extensive invasion of tumor cells into adjacent brain tissues. More importantly, ALTS1C1 expressed a relatively high level of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) in vitro and in vivo and higher microvascular density (MVD) in vivo. To define the roles of SDF-1 in this tumor model, the expression of SDF-1 in ALTS1C1 cells was inhibited by specific siRNA. SDF-knockdown ALTS1C1 (SDF(kd)) cells took longer than parental ALTS1C1 cells to form tumors and in contrast to the wild-type tumors they had well-defined regular borders and lacked infiltration tracts. The SDF(kd) tumors were also associated with a lower MVD and more hypoxic areas. In contrast to parental tumors, the density of F4/80-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in SDF(kd) tumor was higher in non-hypoxic than in hypoxic regions.

This study not only provides new insight into the role of SDF-1 in brain tumor invasion and the relationship between TAMs and hypoxia, but also provides a new preclinical brain tumor model for designing new treatment options for invasive cases."

Although dramatic improvements in survival for pediatric malignancy has been achieved in previous years advancements seem to be slowing down. For the development of new enhanced therapy and an increased understanding of the disease, pre-clinical models better capturing the neoplastic niche are essential. Tumors of early childhood present in this respect a particular challenge. Here, we explore how components of the embryonic process in stem‑cell induced mature teratoma can function as an experimental in vivo microenvironment instigating the growth of injected childhood neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines. Three human NB cell lines, IMR-32, Kelly and SK-N-BE(2), were injected into mature pluripotent stem cell‑induced teratoma (PSCT) and compared to xenografts of the same cell lines. Proliferative NB cells from all lines were readily detected in both models with a typical histology of a poorly differentiated NB tumor with a variable amount of fibrovascular stroma. Uniquely in the PSCT microenvironment, NB cells were found integrated in a non‑random fashion. Neuroblastoma cells were never observed in areas with well-differentiated somatic tissue i.e. bone, muscle, gut or areas of other easily identifiable tissue types. Instead, the three cell lines all showed initial growth exclusively occurring in the embryonic loose mesenchymal stroma, resulting in a histology recapitulating NB native presentation in vivo. Whether this reflects the 'open' nature of loose mesenchyme more easily giving space to new cells compared to other more dense tissues, the rigidity of matrix providing physical cues modulating NB characteristics, or if embryonic loose mesenchyme may supply developmental cues that attracted or promoted the integration of NB, remains to be tested. We tentatively hypothesize that mature PSCT provide an embryonic niche well suited for in vivo studies on NB."

Doses of 10(14) vp/kg were able to completely and durably eradicate tumors in a variant SCLC heterotransplant model in two of six mice. Gene expression profiling revealed that permissive lines are typified by lower expression of the early neurogenic transcription factor ASCL1 and, conversely, by higher expression of the late neurogenic transcription factor NEUROD1. This classifier demonstrates a sensitivity of .89, specificity of .92, and accuracy of .91. The NEUROD1 to ASCL1 ratio may serve as a predictive biomarker of SVV-001 efficacy. "

Yet, despite extensive genetic mixing, GAS strains have discrete ecological phenotypes. To further our understanding of the molecular basis for ecological phenotypes, comparative genomic hybridization of a set of 97 diverse strains to a GAS pangenome microarray was undertaken, and the association of accessory genes with emm genotypes that define tissue tropisms for infection was determined. Of the 22 nonprophage accessory gene regions (AGRs) identified, only 3 account for all statistically significant linkage disequilibrium among strains having the genotypic biomarkers for throat versus skin infection specialists. Networked evolution and population structure analyses of loci representing each of the AGRs reveal that most strains with the skin specialist and generalist biomarkers form discrete clusters, whereas strains with the throat specialist biomarker are highly diverse. To identify coinherited and coselected accessory genes, the strength of genetic associations was determined for all possible pairwise combinations of accessory genes among the 97 GAS strains. Accessory genes showing very strong associations provide the basis for an evolutionary model, which reveals that a major transition between many throat and skin specialist haplotypes correlates with the gain or loss of genes encoding fibronectin-binding proteins. This study employs a novel synthesis of tools to help delineate the major genetic changes associated with key adaptive shifts in an extensively recombined bacterial species."

Comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the genome of isolate I1101/16 was similar to that of strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 from the 5' end of the genome to the 5' end of the S2 gene and from the 5' end of the 3a gene to the end of the genome, whereas the remaining parts of the genome sequences were more closely related to those of strain 4/91 than those of ck/CH/LJL/140901, thereby suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. SimPlot and Bootscan analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, where it showed that isolate I1101/16 arose through recombination events between ck/CH/LJL/140901- and 4/91-like viruses. Isolate I1101/16 and strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 shared identical amino acids in almost all five of their B cell epitopes, but the two viruses had a serotype relatedness value of 65, which is well below 80, i.e., the lower cutoff value for viruses of the same serotype.

Although many chemical and proteic signals have been identified to guide pollen tube growth, the mechanism by which the tube changes direction in response to these signals is poorly understood. We designed an experimental setup using a microscope-mounted galvanotropic chamber that allowed us to induce the redirection of in vitro pollen tube growth through a precisely timed and calibrated external signal. Actin destabilization, reduced calcium concentration in the growth medium and inhibition of calcium channel activity decreased the responsiveness of the pollen tube to a tropic trigger. An increased calcium concentration in the medium enhanced this response and was able to rescue the effect of actin depolymerization. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the motion pattern of vesicles and the dynamics of the subapical actin array undergo spatial reorientation prior to the onset of a tropic response. Together these results suggest that the precise targeting of the delivery of new wall material represents a key component in the growth machinery that determines directional elongation in pollen tubes."

Other regions in the surface gp120 subunit of Env can modulate coreceptor tropism in a manner that is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of env determinants outside of V3 on coreceptor usage through the analysis of (i) patient-derived env clones that differ in coreceptor tropism, (ii) chimeric env sequences, and (iii) site-directed mutants. The introduction of distinct V3 sequences from CXCR4-using clones into an R5-tropic env backbone conferred the inefficient use of CXCR4 in some but not all cases. Conversely, in many cases, X4- and dual-tropic env backbones containing the V3 sequences of R5-tropic clones retained the ability to use CXCR4, suggesting that sequences outside of the V3 regions of these CXCR4-using clones were responsible for CXCR4 use. The determinants of CXCR4 use in a set of dual-tropic env sequences with V3 sequences identical to those of R5-tropic clones mapped to the gp41 transmembrane (TM) subunit. In one case, a single-amino-acid substitution in the fusion peptide of TM was able to confer CXCR4 use; however, TM substitutions associated with CXCR4 use varied among different env sequences. These results demonstrate that sequences in TM can modulate coreceptor specificity and that env sequences other than that of V3 may facilitate efficient CXCR4-mediated entry. We hypothesize that the latter plays an important role in the transition from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor use."

We investigated the cellular tropism of lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV) toward neuron and glia in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascularis). Lentivirus and AAV were injected into putamen of the monkey brain. One month after injection, monkeys were sacrificed, and then the presence of viral infection by expression of reporter fluorescence proteins was examined. Tissues were sectioned and stained with NeuN and GFAP antibodies for identifying neuronal cells or astrocytes, respectively, and viral reporter GFP-expressing cells were counted. We found that while lentivirus infected mostly astrocytes, AAV infected neurons at a higher rate than astrocytes. Moreover, astrocytes showed reactiveness when cells were infected by virus, likely due to virus-mediated neuroinflammation. The Sholl analysis was done to compare the hypertrophy of infected and uninfected astrocytes by virus. The lentivirus infected astrocytes showed negligible hypertrophy whereas AAV infected astrocytes showed significant changes in morphology, compared to uninfected astrocytes. In the brain of cynomolgus monkey, lentivirus shows tropism for astrocytes over neurons without much reactivity in astrocytes, whereas AAV shows tropism for neurons over glial cells with a significant reactivity in astrocytes. We conclude that AAV is best-suited for gene delivery to neurons, whereas lentivirus is the best choice for gene delivery to astrocytes in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys. "

HTLV-2 is aleukemic and predominantly immortalizes/transforms CD8(+) T cells in culture.

The surface component (SU) of the HTLV-1 envelope is responsible for binding to the cellular receptors for entry. Here, we dissect the HTLV-1 SU further to identify key domains that are involved in determining the immortalization tropism. We generated HTLV-1 envelope recombinant virus containing the HTLV-2 SU domain. HTLV-1/SU2 was capable of infecting and immortalizing freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture. HTLV-1/SU2 shifted the CD4(+) T cell immortalization tropism of wild-type HTLV-1 (wtHTLV-1) to a CD8(+) T cell preference. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution, N195D, in HTLV-1 SU (Ach.195) resulted in a shift to a CD8(+) T cell immortalization tropism preference. Longitudinal phenotyping analyses of the in vitro transformation process revealed that CD4(+) T cells emerged as the predominant population by week 5 in wtHTLV-1 cultures, while CD8(+) T cells emerged as the predominant population by weeks 4 and 7 in wtHTLV-2 and Ach.195 cultures, respectively. Our results indicate that SU domain independently influences the preferential T cell immortalization tropism irrespective of the envelope counterpart transmembrane (TM) domain. We further showed that asparagine at position 195 in HTLV-1 SU is involved in determining this CD4(+) T cell immortalization tropism. The slower emergence of the CD8(+) T cell predominance in Ach.195-infected cultures suggests that other residues/domains contribute to this tropism preference. "

We have examined neural cell tropism of demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains of MHV in order to determine whether central nervous system (CNS) cell tropism plays a role in demyelination. Previous studies demonstrated that recombinant MHV strains, isogenic other than for the spike gene, differ in the extent of neurovirulence and the ability to induce demyelination. Here we demonstrate that these strains also differ in their abilities to infect a particular cell type(s) in the brain. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the differential localization of viral antigen in spinal cord gray matter and that in white matter during acute infection and the ability to induce demyelination later on. Viral antigen from demyelinating strains is detected initially in both gray and white matter, with subsequent localization to white matter of the spinal cord, whereas viral antigen localization of nondemyelinating strains is restricted mainly to gray matter. This observation suggests that the localization of viral antigen to white matter during the acute stage of infection is essential for the induction of chronic demyelination. Overall, these observations suggest that isogenic demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains of MHV, differing in the spike protein expressed, infect neurons and glial cells in different proportions and that differential tropism to a particular CNS cell type may play a significant role in mediating the onset and mechanisms of demyelination."

In particular, very little is known about the role that epigenetic mechanisms play in cell migration and tropism of MSCs. In this study, we investigated whether histone deacetylation was involved in the repression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood (CB) and bone marrow (BM). Induction of uPA expression by histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate was observed in CB- and BM-derived MSCs examined. In vitro migration assays showed that induction of uPA expression by histone deacetylase inhibitors in CB- and BM-derived MSCs significantly enhanced tumor tropism of these cells. Furthermore, overexpression of uPA in CB-MSCs induced migration capacity toward human cancer cells in vitro.

In mice, NS3 was detected in phagocytes of the spleen and lymph node, hepatocytes in liver, and myeloid cells in bone marrow. In human autopsy tissues, NS3 was present in phagocytes in lymph node and spleen, alveolar macrophages in lung, and perivascular cells in brain. This protein was also found in hepatocytes in liver and endothelial cells in spleen, although NS3 was not present in endothelium in any other tissue. Thus, NS3-specific immunostaining supports roles for infected phagocytes, hepatocytes, and, to a limited degree, endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of severe dengue."

To date, why these flaviviruses can be transmitted without mosquito vectors remains poorly understood. To explore the key molecular basis of flavivirus transmissibility, we compared virus replication and transmissibility of an early and a recent TMUV in ducks. The recent TMUV strain FX2010 replicated systemically and transmitted efficiently in ducks, while the replication of early strain MM1775 was limited and did not transmit among ducks. The TMUV envelope protein and its domain I were responsible for tissue tropism and transmissibility. The mutation S156P in the domain I resulted in disruption of N-linked glycosylation at amino acid 154 of the E protein and changed the conformation of ""150 loop"" of the E protein, which reduced virus replication in lungs and abrogated transmission in ducks. These data indicate that the 156S in the envelope protein is critical for TMUV tissue tropism and transmissibility in ducks in the absence of mosquitos. Our findings provide novel insights on understanding TMUV transmission among ducks."

To study the molecular responses of viral infectivity in mammals, in vitro two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellular models have been employed. The in vivo models of mouse, pig, chicken, and nonhuman primates are primarily used to investigate the teratogenicity of the virus, to study effects of the virus on specific tissues, and to study the systemic effects of a proposed antiviral agent. The virus exhibits wide tissue tropism in the mammalian host. The major host tissues of viral persistence and propagation are neural tissue, ocular tissue, testicular tissue and placental tissue. An understanding of the function of viral components, viral replication cycle, and the molecular responses elicited in the host tissues is imperative for designing antiviral treatment strategies and for development of vaccines.

Several lines of evidence have revealed that these viruses are transmitted by competent vectors in a circulative manner, involving entry into the vector's body and the crossing of epithelial tissues forming the alimentary tract and the salivary glands. Similar to luteovirids and geminiviruses, a third family of plant viruses, the family Nanoviridae, have also been reported to be transmitted by aphids in a circulative manner. However, there is limited direct evidence of a possible path of translocation through the aphid vectors. Here, we used time-course experiments and transmission assays coupled with real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays on dissected tissues to examine the translocation, compartmentalization and retention of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) into the aphid vector Pentalonia nigronervosa. Our results indicate that BBTV translocates rapidly through the aphid vector; it is internalized into the anterior midgut in which it accumulates and is retained at concentrations higher than either the haemolymph or the principal salivary glands. Despite the large increase in viral concentration, we have failed to detect BBTV transcripts with RT-PCR. When tissues were not permeabilized, BBTV localized as distinct puncta in the proximity of the basal surface of the cells forming the anterior midgut and principal salivary glands, suggesting an on-going process of virion escape and internalization, respectively. Interestingly, we document that those organs can have direct contact within the aphid body, suggesting a possible haemolymph-independent translocation path."

Although a small set of amino-acid properties such as charge and sequence length applied to HIV-1 envelope V3 loop sequence data can be used to predict co-receptor usage, we sought to expand the fundamental understanding of the physiochemical basis of tropism by analyzing many, perhaps less obvious, amino-acid properties over a diverse array of HIV sequences. We examined 74 amino-acid physicochemical scales over 1,559 V3 loop sequences with biologically tested tropisms downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Linear regressions were then calculated for each feature relative to three tropism transitions (R5→X4; R5→R5X4; R5X4→X4). Independent correlations were rank ordered to determine informative features. A structural analysis of the V3 loop was performed to better interpret these findings relative to HIV tropism states. Similar structural changes are required for R5 and R5X4 to transition to X4, thus suggesting that R5 and R5X4 types are more similar than either phenotype is to X4. Overall, the analysis suggests a continuum of viral tropism that is only partially related to charge; in fact, the analysis suggests that charge modification may be primarily attributed to decreased R5 usage, and further structural changes, particularly those associated with β-sheet structure, are likely required for full X4 usage."

PrPSc conformation to disease phenotype relationships extensively vary among prion strains. In particular, prions exhibit a strain-dependent tropism for lymphoid tissues. Prions can be composed of several substrain components. There is evidence that these substrains can propagate in distinct tissues (e.g. brain and spleen) of a single individual, providing an experimental paradigm to study the cause of prion tissue selectivity. Previously, we showed that PrPC expression levels feature in prion substrain selection in the brain. Transmission of sheep scrapie isolates (termed LAN) to multiple lines of transgenic mice expressing varying levels of ovine PrPC in their brains resulted in the phenotypic expression of the dominant sheep substrain in mice expressing near physiological PrPC levels, whereas a minor substrain replicated preferentially on high expresser mice. Considering that PrPC expression levels are markedly decreased in the spleen compared to the brain, we interrogate whether spleen PrPC dosage could drive prion selectivity. The outcome of the transmission of a large cohort of LAN isolates in the spleen from high expresser mice correlated with the replication rate dependency on PrPC amount. There was a prominent spleen colonization by the substrain preferentially replicating on low expresser mice and a relative incapacity of the substrain with higher-PrPC level need to propagate in the spleen. Early colonization of the spleen after intraperitoneal inoculation allowed neuropathological expression of the lymphoid substrain. In addition, a pair of substrain variants resulting from the adaptation of human prions to ovine high expresser mice, and exhibiting differing brain versus spleen tropism, showed different tropism on transmission to low expresser mice, with the lymphoid substrain colonizing the brain. Overall, these data suggest that PrPC expression levels are instrumental in prion lymphotropism."

Furthermore, GAd, unlike HAd5, did not exhibit hepatotropism or induce liver inflammatory toxicity in mice, demonstrating the exceptional safety profile of the vector vis-à-vis systemic utility. We further demonstrated that the GAd capsid fiber shared the flexibility of the HAd5 equivalent for permitting genetic modification; GAd with the pan-EC-targeting ligand myeloid cell-binding peptide (MBP) incorporated in the capsid displayed a reduced lung tropism and efficiently retargeted gene expression to vascular beds in other organs."

Out of 55 patients, 50 had an HIV-1 subtype B strain, and mean (SD) age was 18.2 (4.6) years. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 13 years (range, 3-23). Thirty-three (60%) patients harbored the R5 virus. At the time of the testing, the median CD4+ T lymphocyte cell count and percentage were 705 cells/mm3 (474-905) and 32.5% in group R5 and 626 cells/mm3 (450-755) and 31.7% in group X4/D-M, respectively. The nadir of CD4+ T-cell count in groups R5 and X4/D-M were 322 cells/mm3 (230-427) and 340 cells/mm3 (242-356), respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Fifteen patients had HIV-1 RNA ≯50 copies/mL. The median HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 DNA were comparable in both groups without a statistical difference. The study provides an overview of the prevalence of coreceptor tropism in a cohort of patients who were vertically infected with HIV-1. The high prevalence of X4/D-M-tropic strains may simply reflect the long-term exposure to HIV. "

Animal hepaciviruses are rarely characterized so far. Apart from norway rat hepacivirus which represents a promising HCV surrogate model, only equine hepaciviruses have been studied to some extent. BovHepV has been initially identified in bovine samples and was shown to establish persistent infections in cattle. However, consequences of those chronic infections, humoral immune response and the possibility of an extended host spectrum have not been explored so far. Therefore, we here investigated (a) the presence of anti-NS3-antibodies and viral RNA in cattle herds in Germany, (b) the course of infection in cattle, and (c) the host tropism including zoonotic potential of bovine hepaciviruses. Our results show that 19.9% of investigated bovine serum samples had antibodies against BovHepV. In 8.2% of investigated samples, viral RNA was detected. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed a novel genetic cluster of BovHepV variants. For 25 selected cattle in a BovHepV positive herd the presence of viral genomic RNA was monitored over one year in two to three months intervals by RT-PCR in order to discriminate acute versus persistent infection. In persistently infected animals, no serum antibodies were detected. Biochemical analyses could not establish a link between BovHepV infection and liver injury. Apart from a single sample of a pig providing a positive reaction in the antibody test, neither BovHepV-specific antibodies nor viral RNA were detected in porcine, equine or human samples implying a strict host specificity of BovHepV."

We evaluated the performance of several sequence-based algorithms for co-receptor usage prediction employed on subtype A V3 sequences including circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and subtype C strains. We further analysed sequence profiles of gp120 regions of subtype A, B and C to explore functional relationships to entry phenotypes. Our analyses clearly demonstrate that state-of-the-art algorithms are not useful for predicting co-receptor tropism of subtype A and its CRFs. Sequence profile analysis of gp120 revealed molecular variability in subtype A viruses. Especially, the V2 loop region could be associated with co-receptor tropism, which might indicate a unique pattern that determines co-receptor tropism in subtype A strains compared to subtype B and C strains. Thus, our study demonstrates that there is a need for the development of novel algorithms facilitating tropism prediction of HIV-1 subtype A to improve effective antiretroviral treatment in patients."

In HCMV, both gB and PC are neutralizing antibody antigens. The relevance of GPCMV PC for virus tropism and vaccine target remains controversial. A novel guinea pig placental amniotic sac epithelial (GPASE) cell-line did not express viral cell receptor platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and resulted in requirement for the PC for GPCMV infection unless PDGFRA was ectopically expressed. High titer anti-gB sera from a GPCMV gB vaccine study was evaluated for GPCMV neutralizing capability on GPASE cells in comparison to convalescent sera from GPCMV(PC+) or GPCMV(PC-) infected animals. Anti-gB sera neutralized fibroblast infection but was less effective compared to anti-GPCMV(PC-), which had antibodies to gH/gL. However, both anti-GPCMV(PC-) and anti-gB sera similarly had reduced neutralizing capability on GPASE and renal epithelial cells in comparison to anti-GPCMV(PC+) sera, which had additional antibodies to PC.

An external quality assessment (EQA) program was implemented to ensure competency in assessing the tropism of clinical samples conducted by MARCH laboratories (n = 14). The MARCH EQA has three prestudy phases assessing V3 loop sequencing and tropism determination using the bioinformatic algorithm geno2pheno, which generates a false-positive rate (FPR). DNA sequences with low FPRs are more likely to be from CXCR4-using (X4) viruses. Phase 1 of the EQA involved chromatogram interpretation. Phases 2, 2/3, and 3 involved patient and clonal samples. Clinical samples used in these phases were from treatment-experienced HIV-infected volunteers; 18/20 had viral loads of <50 copies/ml, and 10/15 were CXCR4-tropic on prior phenotyping. All samples were tested in triplicate, and any replicate with a geno2pheno FPR of <10% was designated X4. Performance was deemed adequate if ≤2 R5 and ≤1 X4 specimens were miscalled. For several clinical samples in the EQA, triplicate testing revealed marked DNA variability (FPR range, 0 to 96.7%). Therefore, a consensus-based approach was employed for each sample, i.e., a median FPR across laboratories was used to define sample tropism. Further sequencing analysis showed mixed viral populations in the clinical samples, explaining the differences in tropism predictions. All laboratories passed the EQA after achieving predefined competence thresholds in either of the phase 2 rounds. The use of clinical samples from patients resembling those who were likely to be screened in the MARCH, coupled with triplicate testing, revealed inherent DNA variability that might have been missed if single or duplicate testing and/or clonal samples alone were used. These data highlight the importance of intensive EQA of tropism laboratories before embarking on clinical studies. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no.

In the last few years, different phenotyping assays have been developed to determine the use of the co-receptor. However, the Trofile phenotype assay is currently the one most used for the determination of tropism, since it is the only one that has been clinically validated. Given that the presence of X4- tropic variants in the viral population has been associated with virological failure to MVC, the main challenge of both genotyping and phenotyping tools is to optimise their sensitivity for detecting X4-tropic variants present in a minority of the viral population. At the same time, the correlation between genotyping/phenotyping methods is being evaluated to determine whether genotyping tools can be useful to make therapeutic decisions."

Amplification of the genomic sequence of the envelope and the gag genes by RT-PCR confirmed the presence of CAEV proviral DNA in the brain cells of affected animals. No productive infection of the astrocytes was observed. The results of this study showed a lot of similarities in the tropism of CAE virus infection of goat brain cells to that of HIV infection in humans thus suggesting the potential usefulness of the caprine model for the study of HIV neuropathology.

A total of 266 sequences were obtained from 101 patient samples. Discordance in tropism prediction for the triplicates was observed in ten samples using an FPR of 10%. Triplicate testing resulted in a 16.7% increase in X4-predicted samples and to reclassification from R5 to X4 tropism for four cases rendering these patients ineligible for Maraviroc treatment.

Here, we provide several lines of evidence supporting Wolbachia's targeting of ovarian stem cell niches--referred to as ""niche tropism""--as a previously overlooked strategy for Wolbachia thriving in nature. Niche tropism is pervasive in Wolbachia infecting the Drosophila genus, and different patterns of niche tropism are evolutionarily conserved. Phylogenetic analysis, confirmed by hybrid introgression and transinfection experiments, demonstrates that bacterial factors are the major determinants of differential patterns of niche tropism. Furthermore, bacterial load is increased in germ-line cells passing through infected niches, supporting previous suggestions of a contribution of Wolbachia from stem-cell niches toward vertical transmission. These results support the role of stem-cell niches as a key component for the spreading of Wolbachia in the Drosophila genus and provide mechanistic insights into this unique tissue tropism."

BKV infection is less commonly associated with pneumonitis, retinitis, liver disease, and meningoencephalitis. BKV is known to replicate, establish latency, undergo reactivation, and induce clinical pathology in renal tubular epithelial cells. However, recent in vitro studies support the notion that BKV has expanded tropism-targeting glomerular parenchymal cells of the human kidney, which could impact glomerular function, enhance inflammation, and serve as viral reservoirs for reactivation from latency during immunosuppression. The implications of BKV expanded tropism in the glomerulus, and how specific host and viral factors that would contribute to glomerular inflammation, cytolysis, and renal fibrosis are related to BKV associated nephropathy (BKVAN), have not been explored.

Among the 9 sample pairs with discordant tropisms, a larger proportion of pvDNA samples harboring CXCR4/dual-mixed-tropic viruses was found, in comparison with plasma RNA samples (88.9% versus 11.1%; P = 0.0034). Discordant samples were characterized by greater genetic variability than were concordant samples. With stratification of the paired samples according to viremia levels, the prevalence of discordant samples decreased with increasing viremia (<50 copies/ml, 21.4%; 51 to 500 copies/ml, 15.4%; >500 copies/ml, 6.7%; P = 0.2). Our findings confirm that prediction of viral tropism using pvDNA is feasible even in low-level viremia and provides useful information for therapy optimization for patients with low or suppressed viremia.

The isolate I0305/19 was clustered together with viruses in sublineage D of GI-19 lineage on the basis of the complete S1 sequence analysis. Isolate I0305/19 and other GI-19 viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110-112 in the S protein. Further analysis based on the complete genomic sequence showed that the isolate emerged through at least four recombination events between GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848- and GI-13 4/91-like strains, in which the S gene was found to be similar to that of the GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-like strain. Pathological assessment showed the isolate was a nephropathogenic IBV strain that caused high morbidity of 100 % and mortality of 80 % in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. The isolate I0305/19 exhibited broader tropisms in different tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils. Furthermore, subpopulations of the virus were found in tissues of infected chickens; this finding is important in understanding how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease. This information is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms of replication and evolution of other coronaviruses such as the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2."

However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African NHPs) are largely resistant to infection due to entry and/or post-entry restriction mechanisms. These highly variable rates of macrophage infection may stem from differences in the host immune environment, entry and post-entry restriction mechanisms, the ability of a virus to adapt to efficiently infect macrophages, and the pleiotropic effects of macrophage-tropism including the ability to infect cells lacking CD4 and increased neutralization sensitivity. Questions remain about the relationship between rates of macrophage infection and viral pathogenesis, with some evidence suggesting that elevated levels of macrophage infection may contribute to greater pathogenesis in non-natural SIV hosts. Alternatively, extensive infection of macrophages may only emerge in the context of high viral loads and immunodeficiency, making it a symptom of highly pathogenic infections, not a primary driver of pathogenesis."

Although these viruses mainly circulate among rodents worldwide, spill-over infection to humans occurs. Orthohantavirus infection in humans can result in two distinct clinical outcomes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). While both syndromes develop following respiratory transmission and are associated with multi-organ failure and high mortality rates, little is known about the mechanisms that result in these distinct clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify which cell types and tissues play a role in the differential development of pathogenesis in humans. Here, we review current knowledge on cell tropism and its role in pathogenesis during orthohantavirus infection in humans and reservoir rodents. Orthohantaviruses predominantly infect microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) of a variety of organs (lungs, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen) in humans. However, in this review we demonstrate that other cell types (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, and tubular epithelium) are infected as well and may play a role in the early steps in pathogenesis. A key driver for pathogenesis is increased vascular permeability, which can be direct effect of viral infection in ECs or result of an imbalanced immune response in an attempt to clear the virus. Future studies should focus on the role of identifying how infection of organ-specific endothelial cells as well as other cell types contribute to pathogenesis."

Here we compare the results of genotypic and phenotypic tropism testing in Study 202. A total of 304 subjects screened had paired genotypic and phenotypic results. Genotypic tropism testing (GTT) incorporated triplicate population sequencing using the geno2pheno algorithm and the PSSM algorithm, followed by ultradeep sequencing (UDS) for samples with R5 results. All samples were further evaluated with a phenotypic test, the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay (ESTA). Concordance between GTT and ESTA was 80% and increased to 84% when only geno2pheno was used for triplicate population sequencing. GTT (geno2pheno) classified 18% of the samples as non-R5 compared to 16% by ESTA. Only one-third of samples with non-R5 results by either test were classified as non-R5 by both tests. Median CD4((+)) cell counts were lower in patients with concordant non-R5 results by UDS and ESTA than in subjects with an R5 result by either assay (p=0.0004). UDS detected non-R5 virus in an additional 27/304 subjects (median 15% non-R5, interquartile range: 3.7-62%) with R5 results by ESTA. In conclusion, the geno2pheno algorithm improves concordance of GTT with a clinically validated phenotypic tropism assay as does the use of UDS. These findings provide support for recent guidelines indicating that genotypic tropism testing may be considered as an alternative to phenotypic testing."

In resistant species, virus infection was not prevented, but mostly restricted to the roots. This phenomenon was also observed after partial replacement of genes of one CTV strain from another, despite both parental strains being capable of systemic infection. Finally, the roots remained susceptible in the absence of viral gene products needed for systemic infection of shoots. Our results suggest that all phloem cells within a plant are not equally susceptible and that changes in host or virus may produce a novel tropism: restriction by the host to a location where further virus spread is prevented.

Duck is the natural host of EDSV. EDSV derived from ducks abrogate egg drop in laying hens. We have previously confirmed that duck-derived EDSVs have a variety of replication activities in chick embryo liver (CEL) cells. However, it is currently unclear whether duck-derived EDSV could display tropism and adaptation in laying hens. This study assessed whether duck-derived EDSV can adapt to laying hens, and estimated the inducing factors. Complete genome sequences of duck-derived EDSVs (D11-JW-012, D11-JW-017, and D11-JW-032 isolates) with various replication efficiency in CEL cells and C10-GY-001 isolate causing disease in laying hens were analyzed to find their differences. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequence revealed that C10-GY-001, D11-JW-032, and strain 127 virus as vaccine were clustered into the same group, with D11-JW-012 and D11-JW-017 clustered in another group. Comparison between D11-JW-012 isolate that poorly replicated and D11-JW-017 isolate that replicated well in CEL cells in same cluster revealed six amino acid differences on IVa2, DNA polymerase, endopeptidase, and DNA-binding protein. These amino acids might be key candidates enhancing cellular tropism in chicken. When the pathogenicities of these isolates in laying hens were compared, D11-JW-032 showed severe signs similar to 127 virus, D11-JW-017 showed intermediate signs, while D11-JW-012 showed almost no sign. Eleven amino acids differed between D11-JW-032 and D11-JW-017, and 17 amino acids were different between D11-JW-032 and D11-JW-012. These results suggest that EDSVs derived from ducks have various pathogenicities in laying hens. Key amino acid candidates might have altered their affinity to tropism of laying hens, causing difference pathogenicities."

Both α2,6-linked and α2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors, which preferentially bind the hemagglutinin (HA) of human and avian influenza viruses, respectively, were detected on the apical surface of the culture with different cellular tropisms. In accordance with the distribution of SA receptors, we observed that a pre-2009 seasonal A(H1N1) virus infected both ciliated and nonciliated cells, whereas a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus primarily infected nonciliated cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that virions were released from or associated with the apical membranes of ciliated, nonciliated, and mucin-secretory goblet cells.

The receptors are nectin1 and HVEM (Herpes virus entry mediator) for gD, and αvβ6 or αvβ8 integrin for gH. In earlier work, insertion of a single chain antibody (scFv) to the cancer receptor HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) in gD, or in gH, resulted in HSVs specifically retargeted to the HER2-positive cancer cells, hence in highly specific non-attenuated oncolytic agents. Here, the scFv to HER2 was inserted in gB (gBHER2). The insertion re-targeted the virus tropism to the HER2-positive cancer cells. This was unexpected since gB is known to be a fusogenic glycoprotein, not a tropism determinant. The gB-retargeted recombinant offered the possibility to investigate how HER2 mediated entry. In contrast to wt-gB, the activation of the chimeric gBHER2 did not require the activation of the gD and of gH/gL by their respective receptors. Furthermore, a soluble form of HER2 could replace the membrane-bound HER2 in mediating virus entry, hinting that HER2 acted by inducing conformational changes to the chimeric gB. This study shows that (i) gB can be modified and become the major determinant of HSV tropism; (ii) the chimeric gBHER2 bypasses the requirement for receptor-mediated activation of other essential entry glycoproteins."

Studying the tropism of Borrelia in the host, how it is sequestered in different organs, and whether it is maintained in circulation and/or in the host's skin is important to understand pathogenicity, infectivity to vector ticks and reservoir competency.We evaluated tissue dissemination of Borrelia in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and great tits (Parus major), naturally and experimentally infected with Borrelia genospecies from enzootic foci. We collected both minimally invasive biological samples (feathers, skin biopsies and blood) and skin, joint, brain and visceral tissues from necropsied birds. Infectiousness of the host was evaluated through xenodiagnoses and infection rates in fed and moulted ticks. Skin biopsies were the most reliable method for assessing avian hosts' Borrelia infectiousness, which was supported by the agreement of infection status results obtained from the analysis of chin and lore skin samples from necropsied birds and of their xenodiagnostic ticks, including a significant correlation between the estimated concentration of Borrelia genome copies in the skin and the Borrelia infection rate in the xenodiagnostic ticks. This confirms a dermatropism of Borrelia garinii, B. valaisiana and B. turdi in its avian hosts. However, time elapsed from exposure to Borrelia and interaction between host species and Borrelia genospecies may affect the reliability of skin biopsies. The blood was not useful to assess infectiousness of birds, even during the period of expected maximum spirochetaemia. From the tissues sampled (foot joint, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, gut and brain), Borrelia was detected only in the gut, which could be related with infection mode, genospecies competition, genospecies-specific seasonality and/or excretion processes."

New data support genotype analysis of the HIV third hypervariable loop (V3) for the identification of tropism. The European Consensus Group on clinical management of tropism testing was established to make recommendations to clinicians and clinical virologists. The panel recommends HIV-tropism testing for the following groups: drug-naive patients in whom toxic effects are anticipated or for whom few treatment options are available; patients who have poor tolerability to or toxic effects from current treatment or who have CNS pathology; and patients for whom therapy has failed and a change in treatment is considered. In general, an enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay and V3 population genotyping are the recommended methods. Genotypic methods are anticipated to be used more frequently in the clinical setting because of their greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time than other methods. For the interpretation of V3 loop genotyping, clinically validated systems should be used when possible. Laboratories doing HIV tropism tests should have adequate quality assurance measures. Similarly, close collaboration between HIV clinicians and virologists is needed to ensure adequate diagnostic and treatment decisions."

However, the mechanisms by which lentiviral tropism was altered remained unsolved. Here, we investigated whether proteases released from the cells during viral production affect lentiviral tropism. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-expressing lentiviral vectors were produced using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293FT or 293 T cells and injected into the mouse cerebellum to examine tropism in PCs. We found that the addition of a protease inhibitor-in particular, the cathepsin K (CatK) inhibitor-into the culture medium significantly increased lentiviral tropism in PCs. Moreover, the concentration of CatK in the culture medium drastically increased upon prolonged cultivation, concomitant with the expression levels of CatK in HEK 293 T cells. An increase in CatK activity by the addition of recombinant CatK enzyme to PC-preferential viral solution, which was obtained 2 days post-transfection, shifted the viral tropism toward Bergmann glia. In contrast, a decrease in CatK activity in the Bergmann glia-preferential viral solution, which was obtained 6 days post-transfection by the addition of CatK inhibitor or by the removal of a CatK-containing fraction, restored the PC preference of viruses. These results suggest that the CatK released from deteriorated HEK 293 T cells plays a key role in reducing lentiviral tropism in PCs, presumably by affecting a receptor molecule for lentiviral VSV-G, resulting in the preferential transduction of Bergmann glia."

Roots recognize the moisture gradient in the soil and grow toward the direction of high moisture. This phenomenon is called hydrotropism, and it contributes to efficient water uptake. As nutrients in soil are also unevenly distributed, it is beneficial for plants to grow their roots in the direction of increasing nutrient concentrations, but such a phenomenon has not been demonstrated. Here, we describe the directional growth of roots in response to a nutrient gradient. Using our assay system, the gradient of a nitrogen nutrient, NH4+, was sufficient to stimulate positive tropic responses of rice lateral roots. This phenomenon is a tropism of plant roots to nutrients; hence, we propose the name 'nutritropism'. As well as other tropisms, differential cell elongation was observed before the elongation zone during nutritropism, but the pattern promoting cell elongation preferentially on the non-stimulated side was opposite to those in root hydrotropism and gravitropism. Our evaluation of the NH4+ gradient suggested that the root tips responded to a sub-micromolar difference in NH4+ concentration on both sides of the root. Hydrotropism, gravitropism and phototropism were described in plants as the 'power of movement' by Charles and Francis Darwin in 1880, and these three tropisms have attracted the attention of plant scientists for more than 130 years. Our discovery of nutritropism represents the fourth 'power of movement' in plants and provides a novel root behavioral property used by plants to acquire nutrients efficiently."

In herpesviruses, a complex of two viral glycoproteins, gH and gL (gH/gL), regulates membrane fusion events and influences virion cell tropism. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH/gL can be incorporated into two different protein complexes: a glycoprotein O (gO)-containing complex known as gH/gL/gO, and a complex containing UL128, UL130, and UL131 known as gH/gL/UL128-131. Variability in the relative abundance of the complexes in the virion envelope correlates with differences in cell tropism exhibited between strains of HCMV. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying such variability have remained unclear. We have identified a viral protein encoded by the UL148 ORF (UL148) that influences the ratio of gH/gL/gO to gH/gL/UL128-131 and the cell tropism of HCMV virions. A mutant disrupted for UL148 showed defects in gH/gL/gO maturation and enhanced infectivity for epithelial cells. Accordingly, reintroduction of UL148 into an HCMV strain that lacked the gene resulted in decreased levels of gH/gL/UL128-131 on virions and, correspondingly, decreased infectivity for epithelial cells. UL148 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, but not to the cytoplasmic sites of virion envelopment. Coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that gH, gL, UL130, and UL131 associate with UL148, but that gO and UL128 do not. Taken together, the findings suggest that UL148 modulates HCMV tropism by regulating the composition of alternative gH/gL complexes. "

The role of host receptors that mediate these processes is not well understood. In the current study, we utilized AAV serotype 4 (AAV4) as a model to evaluate whether ubiquitously expressed 2,3-linked sialic acid and the developmentally regulated marker 2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA) regulate viral transport and tropism in the neonatal brain. Modulation of the levels of SA and PSA in cell culture studies using specific neuraminidases revealed possibly opposing roles of the two glycans in AAV4 transduction. Interestingly, upon intracranial injection into lateral ventricles of the neonatal mouse brain, a low-affinity AAV4 mutant (AAV4.18) displayed a striking shift in cellular tropism from 2,3-linked SA(+) ependymal lining to 2,8-linked PSA(+) migrating progenitors in the rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb. In addition, this gain-of-function phenotype correlated with robust CNS spread of AAV4.18 through paravascular transport pathways. Consistent with these observations, altering glycan dynamics within the brain by coadministering SA- and PSA-specific neuraminidases resulted in striking changes to the cellular tropisms and transduction efficiencies of both parental and mutant vectors. We postulate that glycan signatures associated with host development can be exploited to redirect novel AAV vectors to specific cell types in the brain."

Eighty patients with stable HF for over 3 months, LVEF < 50%, and New York Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms will be randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg for 6 months or placebo. All patients will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), 6-min walk test, and quality of life questionnaires. The primary outcome is the change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume measured by CMR. Secondary end-points include change in peak VO2 (CPET); change in LV mass, in LVEF, in myocardial mechanics (strains), in left atrium volumes, in RV function and volumes, in interstitial myocardial fibrosis, and in epicardial adipose tissue (CMR); change in the distance in the 6-min walk test; and changes in quality of life (Kansas Cardiomyopathy questionnaire [KCCQ-12] and the 36-Item Short Form Survey [SF-36]).

Elevated IIR is associated with tissue tropism of different IBV strains. Compared to M41, 885 and QX caused greater induction of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3), melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5) and interferon beta (IFN-β) in CEKC.

This study found that recency of HIV-1 infection and the development of DM tropism may be associated with HAND in the relatively early stage of infection. Together, these data suggest that viral interaction with cellular receptors may play an important role in the early manifestation of HAND."

To clarify the mechanism by which gp42 controls the cell specificity of EBV infection, here we determined the structure of gHgL/gp42 complex bound to an anti-gHgL antibody (E1D1). The critical regulator of EBV tropism is the gp42 N-terminal domain, which tethers the HLA-binding domain to gHgL by wrapping around the exterior of three gH domains. Both the gp42 N-terminal domain and E1D1 selectively inhibit epithelial-cell fusion; however, they engage distinct surfaces of gHgL.

Lymphocytolysis was present in all lymphoid organs except for the thymus. Lesions in the kidney rarely progressed beyond hydropic change and occasional pyknosis or karyolysis in renal tubular epithelial cells. Viral antigen was diffusely present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, but this labeling was noticeably sparse in primary foci. Immunolabeling for RVFV in young lambs was also detected in macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, adrenocortical epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, renal perimacular cells, and cardiomyocytes. RVFV immunolabeling was also often present in capillaries and small blood vessels either as non-cell-associated viral antigen, as antigen in endothelial cells, or intravascular cellular debris.

However, the clinical translation of MSCs remains poorly defined because previous studies relied on glioma models with uncertain relevance to human disease, typically xenograft models in immunocompromised mice. To address this shortcoming, we used the RCAS/Ntv-a system, in which endogenous gliomas that recapitulate the tumor and stromal features of human gliomas develop in immunocompetent mice. MSCs were harvested from bone marrow of Ntv-a mice and injected into the carotid artery of Ntv-a mice previously inoculated with RCAS-PDGF-B and RCAS-IGFBP2 to induce malignant gliomas (n = 9). MSCs were labeled with luciferase for in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). After intra-arterial injection, BLI revealed MSCs in the right frontal lobe in seven of nine mice. At necropsy, gliomas were detected within the right frontal lobe in all these mice, correlating with the location of the MSCs. In the two mice without MSCs based on BLI, no tumor was found, indicating that MSC localization was tumor specific. In another cohort of mice (n = 9), MSCs were labeled with SP-DiI, a fluorescent vital dye. After intra-arterial injection, fluorescence microscopy revealed SP-DiI-labeled MSCs throughout tumors 1 to 7 days after injection but not in nontumoral areas of the brain. MSCs injected intravenously did not localize to tumors (n = 12). We conclude that syngeneic MSCs are capable of homing to endogenous gliomas in immunocompetent mice. These findings support the use of MSCs as tumor-specific delivery vehicles for treating gliomas."

Understanding the determinants of HIV-1 tropism for macrophages will inform HIV-1 control and eradication strategies. Tropism for macrophages is both qualitative (infection or not) and quantitative (replication capacity). For example many R5 HIV-1 isolates cannot infect macrophages, but for those that can the macrophage replication capacity can vary by up to 1000-fold. Some X4 viruses are also capable of replication in macrophages, indicating that cellular tropism is partially independent of co-receptor preference. Preliminary data obtained with a small number of transmitted/founder viruses indicate inefficient macrophage infection, whereas isolates from later in disease are more frequently tropic for macrophages. Thus tropism may evolve over time, and more macrophage tropic viruses may be implicated in the pathogenesis of advanced HIV-1 infection. Compartmentalization of macrophage-tropic brain-derived envelope glycoproteins (Envs), and non-macrophage tropic non-neural tissue-derived Envs points to adaptation of HIV-1 quasi-species in distinct tissue microenvironments. Mutations within and adjacent to the Env-CD4 binding site have been identified that determine macrophage tropism at the entry level, but post-entry molecular determinants of macrophage replication capacity involving HIV-1 accessory proteins need further definition."

However, the virological driver for HIV-mediated CD4 depletion has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HIV-mediated chemokine coreceptor signaling, particularly chronic signaling through CXCR4, plays a major role in CD4 dysfunction and depletion; we also hypothesized that there is an R5X4 signaling (R5X4sig) viral subspecies, evolving from the natural replication course of R5-utilizing viruses, that is responsible for CD4 T cell depletion in R5 virus infection. To gain traction for our hypothesis, in this review, we discuss a recent finding from Cui and co-authors who described the rapid tropism switch and high pathogenicity of an HIV-1 R5 virus, CRF01_AE. We speculate that CRF01_AE may be the hypothetical R5X4sig viral species that is rapidly evolving towards the X4 phenotype.

The nvCT is clonal (serovar/genovar E) and it spread rapidly in Sweden, undiagnosed by these systems. The degree of spread may also indicate an increased biological fitness of nvCT. The aims of this study were to describe the genome of nvCT, to compare the nvCT genome to all available C. trachomatis genome sequences and to investigate the biological properties of nvCT. An early nvCT isolate (Sweden2) was analysed by genome sequencing, growth kinetics, microscopy, cell tropism assay and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. It was compared with relevant C. trachomatis isolates, including a similar serovar E C. trachomatis wild-type strain that circulated in Sweden prior to the initially undetected expansion of nvCT. The nvCT genome does not contain any major genetic polymorphisms - the genes for central metabolism, development cycle and virulence are conserved - or phenotypic characteristics that indicate any altered biological fitness. This is supported by the observations that the nvCT and wild-type C. trachomatis infections are very similar in terms of epidemiological distribution, and that differences in clinical signs are only described, in one study, in women. In conclusion, the nvCT does not appear to have any altered biological fitness. Therefore, the rapid transmission of nvCT in Sweden was due to the strong diagnostic selective advantage and its introduction into a high-frequency transmitting population."

To assess whether the MHC gene region indeed influenced tissue tropism of T. cruzi, we used the same two parasite strains to infect C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) and C57BLKS/J (H-2(d)) mice; the latter strain results from the introgression of DBA2 MHC region into the C57BL/6 background. We also performed ex vivo infections of cardiac explants from four congenic mice lineages with the H-2(b) and H-2(d) haplotypes arranged in two different genetic backgrounds: C57BLKS/J (H-2(d)) versus C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) and BALB/c (H-2(d)) versus BALB/B10-H2(b) (H-2(b)).

X-ray crystal structures for the proximal viral fusogen, glycoprotein B (gB), and for the pentameric gH/gL complex (pentamer) have been solved. A novel virion gH complex consisting of gH bound to UL116 instead of gL was described, and findings supporting the existence of a stable complex between gH/gL and gB were reported. Additional work indicates that the pentamer promotes a mode of cell-associated spread that resists antibody neutralization, as opposed to the trimeric gH/gL complex (trimer), which appears to be broadly required for the infectivity of cell-free virions. Finally, viral factors such as UL148 and US16 were identified that can influence the incorporation of the alternative gH/gL complexes into virions. We will review these advances and their implications for understanding HCMV entry and cell tropism."

Using the recombinant S proteins as probes to perform S protein affinity histochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues, although no tissue or enteric binding of FECV UU7 S protein was detected, it was found that by immunohistochemistry that the tissue distribution of FIPV UU4 S protein-bound cells correlated with that of FIPV antigen-positive cells and lesions associated with FIP and that the affinity binding of FIPV UU4 S protein on macrophages was not affected by enzymatic removal of host cell-surface sialic acid with neuraminidase. These findings suggest that a factor(s) other than sialic acid contribute(s) to the macrophage tropism of FIPV strain UU4.

Therefore, this study used a novel Bayesian evolutionary approach to analyze the A24 variant of coxsackievirus (CV-A24v), an ocular-tropism agent of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Analyses of the 915-nucleotide VP1 and 690-nt 3Dpol regions of 21 strains isolated in Taiwan and worldwide during 1985-2010 revealed a clear chronological trend in both the VP1 and 3Dpol phylogenetic trees: the emergence of a single dominant cluster in each outbreak. The VP1 sequences included three genotypes: GI (prototype), GIII (isolated 1985-1999), and GIV (isolated after 2000); no VP1 sequences from GII strains have been deposited in GenBank. Another five genotypes identified in the 3Dpol region had support values >0.9. Geographic and demographic transitions among CV-A24v clusters were clearly identified by Bayes algorithm. The transmission route was mapped from India to China and then to Taiwan, and each prevalent viral population declined before new clusters emerged. Notably, the VP1 and 3Dpol genes had high nucleotide sequence similarities (94.1% and 95.2%, respectively). The lack of co-circulating lineages and narrow tissue tropism affected the CV-A24v gene pool. "

Autopsy findings documented the in vivo disseminated infection (besides fibroblasts) of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As a result, multiple diagnostic assays, such as quantification of HCMV antigenemia (pp65), viremia (infectious virus), and DNAemia (HCMV DNA) in patient blood, were developed. In vitro experiments showed that only low passage or endothelial cell-passaged clinical isolates, and not laboratory-adapted strains, could reproduce both HCMV leuko- and endothelial cell-tropism, which were found through genetic analysis to require the three viral genes UL128, UL130, and UL131 of the HCMV UL128 locus (UL128L). Products of this locus, together with gH/gL, were shown to form the gH/gL/pUL128L pentamer complex (PC) required for infection of epithelial cells/endothelial cells, whereas gH/gL and gO form the gH/gL/gO trimer complex (TC) required for infection of all cell types. In 2016, following previous work, a receptor for the TC that mediates entry into fibroblasts was identified as PDGFRα, while in 2018, a receptor for the PC that mediates entry into endothelial/epithelial cells was identified as neuropilin2 (Nrp2). Furthermore, the olfactory receptor family member OR14I1 was recently identified as a possible additional receptor for the PC in epithelial cells. Thus, current data support two models of viral entry: (i) in fibroblasts, following interaction of PDGFRα with TC, the latter activates gB to fuse the virus envelope with the cell membrane, whereas (ii) in epithelial cells/endothelial cells, interaction of Nrp2 (and OR14I1) with PC promotes endocytosis of virus particles, followed by gB activation by gH/gL/gO (or gH/gL) and final low-pH entry into the cell."

Here we used CNS and PNS myelinating cultures from wild type and Ifnar1 knockout mice to examine neuronal and glial tropism and short-term consequences of direct infection with a Brazilian variant of ZIKV. Cell cultures were infected pre- or post-myelination for various intervals, then stained with cell-type and ZIKV-specific antibodies. In bypassing systemic immunity using ex vivo culture, and the type I interferon response in Ifnar1 deficient cells, we were able to evaluate the intrinsic infectivity of neural cells. Through systematic quantification of ZIKV infected cells in myelinating cultures, we found that ZIKV infection is enhanced in the absence of the type I interferon responses and that CNS cells are considerably more susceptible to infection than PNS cells. In particular, we demonstrate that CNS axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes are especially vulnerable to injury. These results have implications for understanding the pathobiology of neurological symptoms associated with ZIKV infection. Furthermore, we provide a quantifiable ex vivo infection model that can be used for fundamental and therapeutic studies on viral neuroinvasion and its consequences."

One roadblock to effective gene therapy is the identification of vectors which will safely deliver therapeutics to targeted cells. The cellular heterogeneity that exists within the cochlea makes viral tropism a vital consideration for effective inner ear gene therapy. There are compelling reasons to identify a viral vector with tropism for organ of Corti supporting cells. Supporting cells are the primary expression site of connexin 26 gap junction proteins that are mutated in the most common form of congenital genetic deafness (DFNB1). Supporting cells are also primary targets for inducing hair cell regeneration. Since many genetic forms of deafness are congenital it is necessary to administer gene transfer-based therapeutics prior to the onset of significant hearing loss. We have used transuterine microinjection of the fetal murine otocyst to investigate viral tropism in the developing inner ear. For the first time we have characterized viral tropism for supporting cells following in utero delivery to their progenitors. We report the inner ear tropism and potential ototoxicity of three previously untested vectors: early-generation adenovirus (Ad5.CMV.GFP), advanced-generation adenovirus (Adf.11D) and bovine adeno-associated virus (BAAV.CMV.GFP). Adenovirus showed robust tropism for organ of Corti supporting cells throughout the cochlea but induced increased ABR thresholds indicating ototoxicity. BAAV also showed tropism for organ of Corti supporting cells, with preferential transduction toward the cochlear apex. Additionally, BAAV readily transduced spiral ganglion neurons. Importantly, the BAAV-injected ears exhibited normal hearing at 5 weeks of age when compared to non-injected ears. Our results support the use of BAAV for safe and efficient targeting of supporting cell progenitors in the developing murine inner ear."

This broad in vitro tropism was not observed for a chimeric bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) expressing all structural proteins of Bungowannah virus. The viral envelope was not sufficient to completely transfer the cell tropism of Bungowannah virus to another pestivirus, and viral RNA replication was either markedly reduced or not detectable in a number of different cell lines for the tested BVDV strain and the chimera. We therefore suggest that the replication machinery together with the viral envelope is responsible for the unique broad cell tropism of Bungowannah virus. "

Clinical, serologic, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluations were performed periodically. Two lambs from each infected group and a control animal were euthanized at 134, 273, and 319 days postinfection. Tissues were analyzed by gross and histopathologic evaluation; immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, and FoxP3 cell markers; lung morphometric evaluation; and tissue proviral quantification by PCR. All infected animals became positive either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or PCR, with group B lambs showing the highest serologic values and more consistently positive PCR reactions. Group A lambs showed representative lung lesions but only mild histopathologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS) or in carpal joints. Contrarily, group B lambs demonstrated intense carpal arthritis and interstitial pneumonia but an absence of lesions in the CNS. Proviral copies in tissues were detected only in group B lambs. Experimental infection with these SRLV strains indicates that strain 496 is more virulent than strain 697 and more prone to induce arthritis, whereas strain 697 is more likely to reproduce encephalitis in Rasa Aragonesa lambs. Host factors as well as viral factors are responsible for the final clinicopathologic picture during SRLV infections."

Using poliovirus as a model, we demonstrate that insertion of small miRNA homology sequences into a viral genome can restrict its tissue tropism, thereby preventing pathogenicity and yielding an attenuated viral strain. Poliovirus strains engineered to become targets of neuronal-specific miRNAs lost their ability to replicate in the central nervous system, leading to significant attenuation of neurovirulence in infected animals. Importantly, these viruses retained the ability to replicate in nonneuronal tissues. As a result, these engineered miRNA-regulated viruses elicited strong protective immunity in mice without producing disease."

Selective binding of cellular transcription factors to this promoter region participates in the control of viral tropism. Hence, further study of these proteins might provide new insights into JCV tropism and associated pathogenesis. This review gives an overview of viral proteomics - the study of all proteins expressed from the viral gene transcripts, and all the cellular proteins that play a role in JCV tropism. It also describes a new biochemical approach for studying relevant JCV promoter-binding proteins, which is an anchored-JCV transcriptional promoter (ATP) assay. An ATP assay utilizes the product of PCR-amplified JCV promoter sequences coupled with Sepharose beads in order to capture and isolate cellular nuclear proteins with specific promoter-binding affinity for analysis. Proteins that bind to JCV-ATPs can be eluted and subjected to proteomic analysis. Insights from this approach may improve the understanding of viral and cellular parameters that control JCV tropism."

The emergence of deadly human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have bolstered research in these viral and often zoonotic pathogens. While coronavirus cell and tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis are initially controlled by interactions between the spike envelope glycoprotein and host cell receptor, it is becoming increasingly apparent that proteolytic activation of spike by host cell proteases also plays a critical role. Coronavirus spike proteins are the main determinant of entry as they possess both receptor binding and fusion functions. Whereas binding to the host cell receptor is an essential first step in establishing infection, the proteolytic activation step is often critical for the fusion function of spike, as it allows for controlled release of the fusion peptide into target cellular membranes. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple strategies for proteolytic activation of spike, and a large number of host proteases have been shown to proteolytically process the spike protein. These include, but are not limited to, endosomal cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, and trypsin.

With the current global flavivirus threat, there is an urgent need for antivirals and vaccines to curb the spread of these viruses. However, the lack of suitable animal models limits the research questions that can be answered. A common trait of all flaviviruses studied thus far is their ability to antagonize interferon (IFN) signaling so as to enhance viral replication and dissemination. Previously, we reported that YFV NS5 requires the presence of type I IFN (IFN-α/β) for its engagement with human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (hSTAT2). In this manuscript, we report that like the NS5 proteins of ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV), YFV NS5 protein is able to bind hSTAT2 but not murine STAT2 (mSTAT2). Contrary to what has been demonstrated with ZIKV NS5 and DENV NS5, replacing mSTAT2 with hSTAT2 cannot rescue the YFV NS5-STAT2 interaction, as YFV NS5 is also unable to interact with hSTAT2 in murine cells. We show that the IFN-α/β-dependent ubiquitination of YFV NS5 that is required for STAT2 binding in human cells is absent in murine cells. In addition, we demonstrate that mSTAT2 restricts YFV replication "

Species B human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV-B3) causes pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), whereas HAdV-D8, -D37, and -D64 cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Recently, HAdV-D53, -D54, and -D56 emerged as new EKC-causing agents. HAdV-E4 is associated with both PCF and EKC. We have previously demonstrated that HAdV-D37 uses sialic acid (SA)-containing glycans as cellular receptors on human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, and the virus interaction with SA is mediated by the knob domain of the viral fiber protein. Here, by means of cell-based assays and using neuraminidase (a SA-cleaving enzyme), we investigated whether ocular HAdVs other than HAdV-D37 also use SA-containing glycans as receptors on HCE cells. We found that HAdV-E4 and -D56 infect HCE cells independent of SAs, whereas HAdV-D53 and -D64 use SAs as cellular receptors. HAdV-D8 and -D54 fiber knobs also bound to cell-surface SAs. Surprisingly, HCE cells were found resistant to HAdV-B3 infection. We also demonstrated that the SA-based molecule i.e., ME0462, designed to bind to SA-binding sites on the HAdV-D37 fiber knob, efficiently prevents binding and infection of several EKC-causing HAdVs. Surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ME0462 and fiber knobs. Altogether, we demonstrate that SA-containing glycans serve as receptors for multiple EKC-causing HAdVs, and, that SA-based compound function as a broad-spectrum antiviral against known and emerging EKC-causing HAdVs."

Although selective gene delivery to Purkinje cells would be a powerful technique for the study of pathophysiology in the cerebellum, a method for such a delivery has not yet been established. Here we employed human immunodeficiency virus-derived lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to transduce Purkinje cells and examined factors that critically affect the viral tropism for Purkinje cells. Viral vectors encoding GFP were generated using different protocols, and were then injected into the mouse cerebellum. At 7 days and 2 months post-transduction, the relative proportions of transduced Purkinje cells were determined. Lentiviral vectors harvested from a medium of pH 7.2 preferentially transduced Purkinje cells (about half of the transduced cells). In contrast, when the viral vector was harvested from medium of <or= pH 7.0, only 12-26% of transduced cells were identified as Purkinje cells and 68-77% as Bergmann glia. A similar decrease in the efficiency of transduction for Purkinje cells, depending on the pH of the medium at the viral harvest, was observed in dissociated cell cultures. These results indicate that lentivector tropism for Purkinje cells is extremely sensitive to pH: a subtle decrease in the pH of the medium at the harvest shifts viral tropism strikingly towards Bergmann glia."

We developed a clinical laboratory-based genotypic tropism test for detection of CCR5-using (R5) or X4 variants that utilizes triplicate population sequencing (TPS) followed by ultradeep sequencing (UDS) for samples classified as R5. Tropism was inferred using the bioinformatic algorithms geno2pheno([coreceptor]) and PSSM(x4r5). Virologic response as a function of tropism readout was retrospectively assessed using blinded samples from treatment-experienced subjects who received maraviroc (N = 327) in the MOTIVATE and A4001029 clinical trials. MOTIVATE patients were classified as R5 and A4001029 patients were classified as non-R5 by the original Trofile test. Virologic response was compared between the R5 and non-R5 groups determined by TPS, UDS alone, the reflex strategy and the Trofile Enhanced Sensitivity (TF-ES) test. UDS had greater sensitivity than TPS to detect minority non-R5 variants. The median log(10) viral load change at week 8 was -2.4 for R5 subjects, regardless of the method used for classification; for subjects with non-R5 virus, median changes were -1.2 for TF-ES or the Reflex Test and -1.0 for UDS. The differences between R5 and non-R5 groups were highly significant in all 3 cases (p<0.0001). At week 8, the positive predictive value was 66% for TF-ES and 65% for both the Reflex test and UDS. Negative predictive values were 59% for TF-ES, 58% for the Reflex Test and 61% for UDS. In conclusion, genotypic tropism testing using UDS alone or a reflex strategy separated maraviroc responders and non-responders as well as a sensitive phenotypic test, and both assays showed improved performance compared to TPS alone. Genotypic tropism tests may provide an alternative to phenotypic testing with similar discriminating ability."

Neural stem cells (NSC) are able to home in on tumor foci at sites distant from the main tumor mass, possibly enabling treatment of scattered glioma clusters. To make the strategy more effective, we performed a cDNA expression library screening to identify the candidate genes that once overexpressed would enhance the tropism of NSCs for gliomas. Here, we show that a previously unannotated gene, the one encoding transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), is one such gene. Overexpression of TMEM18 was seen in the current study to provide NSCs and neural precursors an increased migration capacity toward glioblastoma cells in vitro and in the rat brain. Functional inactivation of the TMEM18 gene resulted in almost complete loss of the migration activity of these cells. Thus, TMEM18 is a novel cell migration modulator. Overexpression of this protein could be favorably used in NSC-based glioma therapy."

Genotypic prediction of coreceptor use is a practical alternative to phenotypic tests. Cell DNA and plasma RNA-based prediction has shown discordance in many studies. We evaluate paired cell and plasma either as single or replicate V3 sequences to assess prediction comparability. The HIV-1 partial env region was sequenced and tropism was predicted using geno2pheno and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Nucleotide ambiguities at V3 were quantified and genetic distance (Protdist) was determined using BioEdit. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, t tests, and Spearman correlation were performed with Prism GraphPad5.0. Results are expressed as medians, with a level of significance of p<0.05, two tailed. Single (n=28) or replicate (n=26) paired cell/plasma sequences were obtained from 54 patients. Although the clonalfalse-positive rate (FPR) value from both compartments strongly correlated (r=0.86 p<0.0001), discordance in tropism prediction was observed in both singles and replicates using geno2pheno or PSSM. Applying clonalFPR(10%) 46% (25/54) were X4 tropic, with a plasma/cell discordance of 11% in singles and 23% in replicates. Genetic distance (p<0.0001) and clonalFPR value dispersion (p=0.003) were significantly higher among replicate sequences from cells. Discordance of viral tropism prediction is not uncommon and the use of replicates does not decrease its occurrence, but improves X4 sensitivity. Sequences from provirus had greater genetic distance and dispersion of clonalFPR values. This may suggest that DNA replicate assays may better represent the diversity of HIV-1 variants, but the clinical significance of these findings needs further evaluation."

In vitro differences include acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature and tissue tropism, which reflect a preferential in vivo replication in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and are thus key determinants of EV virulence. To investigate the underlying cause of these differences, we generated chimeras at the capsid-level between EV-D68 (a respiratory EV) and EV-D94 (an enteric EV). Although some chimeras were nonfunctional, EV-D94 with both the capsid and 2A protease or the capsid only of EV-D68 were both viable. Using this latter construct, we performed several functional assays, which indicated that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Additionally, capsid genes were shown to also participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, since EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that EV-D68 maintains residual binding-capacity after acid-treatment despite a loss of infectivity. In contrast, non-structural rather than capsid proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. These unique biophysical insights expose another layer in the phenotypic diversity of one of world's most prevalent pathogens and could aid target selection for vaccine or antiviral development."

In the current study, we describe a unique microsporidian parasite, Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. that has a tropism for both the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, and its digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum. Though the microsporidium first infects a fish, the subsequent infection causes hypertrophy of the metacercarial wall and degeneration of the P. minimum metacercariae within the fish tissue. Genetic analysis placed this species within Ovipleistophora and ultrastructural characteristics were consistent with the genus, including the presence of dimorphic spores within sporophorous vesicles. Meronts did not have a surface coat of dense material, which has been previously reported for the genus. This is the first Ovipleistophora species described that does not have a tropism for ovary. Genetics demonstrated that O. diplostomuri n. sp. groups closely within fish microsporidia and not other species known to be hyperparasitic in digeneans, suggesting that it evolved from fish-infecting microsporidians and developed a secondary tropism for a common and widespread digenean parasite. The high genetic identity to Ovipleistophora species demonstrates the close relationship of this unique microsporidian with other microsporidia that infect ovary."

M2 Exo are derived from M2 macrophages and further electroporated with FDA-approved hexyl 5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL). After systematic administration, the engineered M2 Exo exhibit excellent inflammation-tropism and anti-inflammation effects via the surface-bonded chemokine receptors and the anti-inflammatory cytokines released from the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Moreover, the encapsulated HAL can undergo intrinsic biosynthesis and metabolism of heme to generate anti-inflammatory carbon monoxide and bilirubin, which further enhance the anti-inflammation effects and finally alleviate AS. Meanwhile, the intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) of the heme biosynthesis pathway permits the fluorescence imaging and tracking of AS."

In this study, we used kinetic magnetic resonance imaging (kMRI) to investigate the association between degree of facet tropism and amount of disc bulge in the lumbar spine in relation to age. kMRIs in the flexion, neutral, and extension positions were performed on 410 consecutive patients with low back pain. T2-weighted midsagittal and axial mid-disc cuts were analyzed to measure disc bulge and facet angle. Facet asymmetry was calculated and classified as: no facet tropism, <6°; mild facet tropism, 6-11°; or severe facet tropism, ≥11°. Maximal static bulge (MSB), maximal dynamic bulge (MDB), and age in the facet tropism groups were compared by age subpopulations and MDB categories, defined by the positions between which the largest change in disc bulge occurs. We found the severe facet tropism group to be associated with a nearly significant increase in MSB and MDB over the no facet tropism group in the older subpopulation at the L4-L5 level only, and a larger MDB in the L4-L5 MDB category [E-N], where the greatest change in disc bulge occurs between neutral and extension positions (p = 0.013). Our findings suggest that severe facet tropism is associated with increased disc bulge at L4-L5 in only a subset of older age patients, but may in large part be due to biomechanical factors that define the [E-N] category."

In natural conditions, these two major tropisms act concurrently to create a photogravitropic equilibrium in the responsive organ. Recently, a parsimonious model was developed that accurately predicted the complete gravitropic and proprioceptive control over the movement of different organs in different species in response to gravitational stimuli. Here we show that the framework of this unifying graviproprioceptive model can be readily extended to include phototropism. The interaction between gravitropism and phototropism results in an alignment of the apical part of the organ toward a photogravitropic set-point angle. This angle is determined by a combination of the two directional stimuli, gravity and light, weighted by the ratio between the gravi- and photo-sensitivities of the plant organ. In the model, two dimensionless numbers, the graviproprioceptive number B and the photograviceptive number M, control the dynamics and the shapes of the movement. The extended model agrees well with two sets of detailed quantitative data on photogravitropic equilibrium in oat coleoptiles. It is demonstrated that the influence of light intensity I can be included in the model in a power-law-dependent relationship M(I). The numbers B and M and the related photograviceptive number D are all quantitative genetic traits that can be measured in a straightforward manner, opening the way to the phenotyping of molecular and mechanical aspects of shoot tropism.

The RhCMV mutants grew well in fibroblasts, as predicted by earlier studies with HCMV. However, mutations in four genes caused replication defects in rhesus retinal pigment epithelial cells: Rh01 (an HCMV TRL1 orthologue), Rh159 (HCMV UL148), Rh160 (HCMV UL132), and Rh203 (HCMV US22). Growth of the Rh01-deficient mutant was examined in detail. After entry into epithelial cells, the mutant expressed representative viral proteins, accumulated viral DNA, and generated infectious virus, but it failed to spread efficiently. We conclude that Rh01 is a cell tropism determinant that has the potential to dramatically affect virus spread and pathogenesis."

We identified signatures of tissue-specific transcriptional responses indicative of tropism in the coordination of host's immune tissue responses to infection by viral or bacterial infections. Furthermore, our study shows that this tissue tropism in host transcriptional response to BRD pathogens results in the activation of different networks of response genes. The differential crosstalk among genes expressed in lymphoid tissues was predicted to be orchestrated by specific immune genes that act as 'key players' within expression networks.

Here, solvent-based tissue clearing was used to measure RABV cell tropism in infected brains. Immunofluorescence analysis of 1 mm-thick tissue slices enabled 3D-segmentation and quantification of astrocyte and neuron infection frequencies. Comparison of three highly virulent field virus clones from fox, dog, and raccoon with three lab-adapted strains revealed remarkable differences in the ability to infect astrocytes in vivo. While all viruses and infection routes led to neuron infection frequencies between 7-19%, striking differences appeared for astrocytes. Whereas astrocyte infection by field viruses was detected independent of the inoculation route (8-27%), only one lab-adapted strain infected astrocytes route-dependently [0% after intramuscular (i.m.) and 13% after intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation]. Two lab-adapted vaccine viruses lacked astrocyte infection altogether (0%, i.c. and i.m.). This suggests a model in which the ability to establish productive astrocyte infection in vivo functionally distinguishes field and attenuated lab RABV strains."

However, the receptive DC subset, the degree of restriction for this tropism, and the extent of conservation between rodents and humans have not been well characterized. Using fresh peripheral blood DCs, mononuclear cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived DCs, our results demonstrate conservation of VEE replicon particle (VRP) tropism for DCs between humans and rodents. We observed that a subset of immature myeloid DCs is the target population, and that VRP-transduced immature DCs retain intact functional capacity, for example, the ability to resist the cytopathic effects of VRP transduction and the capacity to acquire the mature phenotype. These studies support the demonstration of selective VRP tropism for human DCs and provide further insight into the biology of the VRP vector, its parent virus, and human DCs."

We developed a novel method using antibodies to direct MMLV to vascular endothelium. We have given the term immunovirosomes to the complexes formed between viruses, liposomes, and antibodies. These immunovirosomes improve the transduction efficiency of the viruses and alter their tropism. We have shown improved transduction when immunovirosomes were targeted at the endocytic receptors CD71 and CD62E/P and rather less good delivery when targeted at CD106. The enhancement of the transduction efficiency was transient, however, suggesting that rerouting the entry pathway of viruses alters the expression properties of the viruses."

Ectopic expression of CLDN1 rendered several non-hepatic cell lines permissive to HCV infection. However, little is known about the mechanism by which CLDN1 mediates HCV entry. It is believed that an additional entry receptor(s) is required because ectopic expression of CLDN1 in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells failed to confer susceptibility to viral infection. Here we found that CLDN1 was co-immunoprecipitated with both HCV envelope proteins when expressed in 293T cells. Results from biomolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that overexpressed CLDN1 also formed complexes with CD81 and low density lipoprotein receptor. Subsequent imaging analysis revealed that CLDN1 was highly enriched at sites of cell-cell contact in permissive cell lines, co-localizing with the TJ marker, ZO-1. However, in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells the ectopically expressed CLDN1 appeared to reside predominantly in intracellular vesicles. The CLDN1-CD81 complex formed in HeLa cells was also exclusively distributed intracellularly, co-localizing with EEA1, an early endosomal marker. Correspondingly, transepithelial electric resistance, obtained from the naturally susceptible human liver cell line, Huh7, was much higher than that of the HeLa-CLDN1 cell line, suggesting that Huh7 is likely to form functional tight junctions. Finally, the disruption of TJ-enriched CLDN1 by tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment markedly reduced the susceptibility of Huh7.5.1 cells to HCV infection. Our results suggest that the specific localization pattern of CLDN1 may be crucial in the regulation of HCV cellular tropism."

Results were totally reversed when wild-type HCMV strains were used to infect either fibroblasts or endothelial cells. Careful analysis and sequencing of plaque-purified viruses from recent clinical isolates drew attention to the ULb' region of the HCMV genome. Using bacterial artificial chromosome technology, it was shown by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments that UL131-128 genes are indispensable for virus growth in endothelial cells and virus transfer to leukocytes. In addition, a number of clinical isolates passaged in human fibroblasts had lost both properties (leuko-tropism and endothelial cell-tropism) when displaying a mutation in the UL131-128 locus (referred to as UL128L). In the following years, it was shown that pUL128L was complexed with gH and gL to form the pentameric complex (PC), which is required to infect endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells. The immune response to PC was studied extensively, particularly its humoral component, showing that the great majority of the neutralizing antibody response is directed to PC. Although anti-HCMV antibodies may act with other mechanisms than mere neutralizing activity, these findings definitely favour their protective activity, thus paving the way to the development of a potentially protective HCMV vaccine."

Variants with reduced sensitivity to inhibitor were readily selected in vitro. Sensitivity determinants were identified for 13 different isolates, all of which mapped to the TM subunit. These determinants were identified in two regions: (i) the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) and (ii) the N-terminal segment of TM, between the subunit cleavage site and the fusion peptide. The latter class of mutants identified a region outside of the predicted HR2-binding site that can significantly alter sensitivity to inhibitor. A subset of the HR1 mutants displayed the unanticipated ability to infect nonavian cells. This expanded tropism was associated with increased efficiency of envelope triggering by soluble receptor at low temperatures, as measured by protease sensitivity of the surface subunit (SU) of envelope. In addition, expanded tropism was linked for the most readily triggered mutants with increased sensitivity to neutralization by SU-specific antiserum.

Three clades of astroviruses, classic, MLB-type and VA-type have been reported in humans. One limitation towards a better understanding of these viruses has been the lack of a physiologically relevant cell culture model that supports growth of all clades of HAstV. Herein, we demonstrate infection of HAstV strains belonging to all three clades in epithelium-only human intestinal enteroids (HIE) isolated from biopsy-derived intestinal crypts. A detailed investigation of infection of VA1, a member of the non-canonical HAstV-VA/HMO clade, showed robust replication in HIE derived from different patients and from different intestinal regions independent of the cellular differentiation status. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that VA1 infects several cell types, including intestinal progenitor cells and mature enterocytes, in HIE cultures. RNA profiling of VA1-infected HIE uncovered that the host response to infection is dominated by interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune responses. A comparison of the antiviral host response in non-transformed HIE and transformed human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells highlighted significant differences between these cells, including an increased magnitude of the response in HIE. Additional studies confirmed the sensitivity of VA1 to exogenous IFNs, and indicated that the endogenous IFN response of HIE to curtail the growth of strains from all three clades. Genotypic variation in the permissiveness of different HIE lines to HAstV could be overcome by pharmacologic inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling. Collectively, our data identify HIE as a universal infection model for HAstV and an improved model of the intestinal epithelium to investigate enteric virus-host interactions."

Mutational approaches can be applied for analysis of the molecular determinants of endothelial cell tropism, but the evaluation of mutants is limited by the low reliability of the widely employed cell tropism assay. The aim of this study was to improve the assay conditions in order to allow for accurate discrimination of phenotypic differences between HCMV mutants. Target cell density and input virus titres were identified to account for most of the variation in the apparent endothelial cell tropism of a given cytomegalovirus strain. Coating of culture dishes, cell attachment at ambient temperature, and standardization of virus input titres together with automated counting of immunofluorescence signals enabled the discrimination of differences of as little as 25% in endothelial cell tropism of HCMV strains. This improvement will facilitate rapid and reliable quantitation of cell tropism of HCMV, and is particularly suitable for the analysis of large numbers of mutants with only minor changes in tropism."

The brains of stillborn pigs were collected and a previously unknown Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), namely SCYA201201, was isolated. According to the results of agarose gel diffusion precipitation, indirect immunofluorescence analysis, neutralization testing, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification, and physical and chemical testing, the virus was conformed to have the characteristics of JEV. The virus titer in BHK-21 cells was 10(8.47)PFU/ml and the median lethal dose (LD50) to 3-week-old and 7-day-old mice was 1.99 log10 and 1.02 log10 PFU/LD50, respectively. The results of tissue tropism for mice showed that the viral load in the brain was significantly higher than other organs, indicating that the isolate was strongly neurotropic. Additionally, the complete genome sequence of the isolate was determined and compared with other JEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate belongs to genotype I and may be an imported virus. The isolate had 88.4% nucleotide identity with the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2. However, there were 69 amino acid substitutions compared with the strain SA14-14-2. Some substitutions indicated that SCYA201201 was highly neurovirulent and infective, in accordance with the results of animal testing. "

Cell type-directed vector capsids can be selected from random peptide libraries displayed on viral capsids in vitro but so far this system could not easily be translated to in vivo applications. Using a novel, PCR-based amplification protocol for peptide libraries displayed on adeno-associated virus (AAV), we selected vectors for optimized transduction of primary tumor cells in vitro. However, these vectors were not suitable for transduction of the same target cells under in vivo conditions. We therefore performed selections of AAV peptide libraries in vivo in living animals after intravenous administration using tumor and lung tissue as prototype targets. Analysis of peptide sequences of AAV clones after several rounds of selection yielded distinct sequence motifs for both tissues. The selected clones indeed conferred gene expression in the target tissue while gene expression was undetectable in animals injected with control vectors. However, all of the vectors selected for tumor transduction also transduced heart tissue and the vectors selected for lung transduction also transduced a number of other tissues, particularly and invariably the heart. This suggests that modification of the heparin binding motif by target-binding peptide insertion is necessary but not sufficient to achieve tissue-specific transgene expression. While the approach presented here does not yield vectors whose expression is confined to one target tissue, it is a useful tool for in vivo tissue transduction when expression in tissues other than the primary target is uncritical."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the prototypical betaherpesvirus, encodes proteins specialized for entry into ECs and delivery of the genome to the nuclei of ECs. Virus strains competent to enter ECs replicate with differing efficiencies, suggesting that the virus encodes genes for postentry tropism in ECs. We previously reported a specific requirement for the UL133/8 locus of HCMV for replication in ECs. The UL133/8 locus harbors four genes: UL133, UL135, UL136, and UL138. In this study, we find that while UL133 and UL138 are dispensable for replication in ECs, both UL135 and UL136 are important. These genes are not required for virus entry or the expression of viral genes. The phenotypes associated with disruption of either gene reflect phenotypes observed for the UL133/8NULL virus, which lacks the entire UL133/8 locus, but are largely distinct from one another. Viruses lacking UL135 fail to properly envelop capsids in the cytoplasm, produce fewer dense bodies (DB) than the wild-type (WT) virus, and are unable to incorporate viral products into multivesicular bodies (MVB). Viruses lacking UL136 also fail to properly envelop virions and produce larger dense bodies than the WT virus. Our results indicate roles for the UL135 and UL136 proteins in commandeering host membrane-trafficking pathways for virus maturation. UL135 and UL136 represent the first HCMV genes crucial for early- to late-stage tropism in ECs."

As a major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP), NP initiates vRNP shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the host cell. However, the characteristics of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NP from H1N1 influenza A virus still remain unclear. In the present study, the subcellular localization and the related key residues of the H1N1 influenza virus NP were identified and evaluated. The NP of influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN) displayed a more obvious nuclear accumulation than A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9; AH) and A/chicken/Shandong/lx1023/2007 (H9N2; SD). NP residue K4, located in NLS1, and residue F253, located in NES3, from WSN NP are not conserved in H7N9 and H9N2, which instead encode Q4 and I253, respectively. Crucially, these residues are involved in the regulation of NP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling through interactions with CRM1 and importin-α. Moreover, residues at position 253 also play important roles in the replication of the virus, resulting in an increase in vRNP polymerase activity and an alteration of the cell tropism and pathogenicity in mice. The present data revealed a pivotal role of the Q4 and I253 residues of NP from H7N9 in enhancing the cytoplasmic accumulation of NP and vRNP activity compared to the K4 and F253 residues in WSN-NP. In addition, an F253I substitution in the NP of WSN altered the survival ratio of infected mice and the growth curve in infected avian-origin cells (DF-1). The current data indicate that the F253I mutation results in attenuated pathogenicity of the virus in mice and altered cell tropism. The present study demonstrated the dissimilarity in subcellular NP transport processes between H1N1 virus WSN and other influenza A virus strains, as well as uncovered the mechanism responsible for this difference."

In several cases, many different symbionts have been reported to coexist simultaneously within the same host and synergistic or antagonistic interactions can occur between them. While the associations with endosymbiotic bacteria have been widely studied in many insect species, in ticks such interactions are less investigated. The females and immatures of Ixodes ricinus (Ixodidae), the most common hard tick in Europe, harbour the intracellular endosymbiont ""Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii"" with a prevalence up to 100%, suggesting a mutualistic relationship. Considering that the tissue distribution of a symbiont might be indicative of its functional role in the physiology of the host, we investigated M. mitochondrii specific localization pattern and the corresponding abundance in selected organs of I. ricinus females. We paired these experiments with in silico analysis of the metabolic pathways of M. mitochondrii, inferred from the available genome sequence, and additionally compared the presence of these pathways in seven other symbionts commonly harboured by ticks to try to obtain a comparative understanding of their biological effects on the tick hosts. M. mitochondrii was found to be abundant in ovaries and tracheae of unfed I. ricinus, and in ovaries, Malpighian tubules and salivary glands of semi-engorged females. These results, together with the in silico metabolic reconstruction allow to hypothesize that the bacterium could play multiple tissue-specific roles in the host, both enhancing the host fitness (supplying essential nutrients, enhancing the reproductive fitness, helping in the anti-oxidative defence, in the energy production and in the maintenance of homeostasis and water balance) and/or for ensuring its presence in the host population (nutrients acquisition, vertical and horizontal transmission). The ability of M. mitochondrii to colonize different tissues allows to speculate that distinctive sub-populations may display different specializations in accordance with tissue tropism. Our hypotheses should be corroborated with future nutritional and physiological experiments for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this symbiotic interaction."

There is a lack of spatial overlap between clinical cases with woodrat exposure, genetic studies show highly distinctive strains in woodrats compared with those from clinical hosts, and experimental studies failed to transfer infection from woodrats into horses. These data suggest that multiple distinct A. phagocytophilum strains could circulate in western U.S. ecosystems.

Sequence analysis revealed that the HN gene of many asymptomatic enteric NDV strains encodes a larger open reading frame (616 amino acids, aa) with additional 39 aa at its C-terminus when compared with that (577 aa) of respirotropic NDV strains. Therefore, it has been suspected that the HN C-terminal extension may contribute to the enteric tropism. In the present study, we generated a NDV respirotropic strain LaSota-based recombinant virus with a HN C-terminal extension of 39 aa derived from an enterotropic NDV strain using reverse genetics technology. The biological characterization of the recombinant virus, rLS-HN-ex, showed that the HN C-terminal extension slightly attenuated the virus pathogenicity in embryonated eggs and in day-old chicks when compared to the parental LaSota virus. However, the HN C-terminal extension did not alter virus tissue tropism. In infected chickens, the recombinant virus was detected and re-isolated from the tracheal tissue, but not from the intestinal tissue, exhibiting a similar respirotropic tissue preference as its parental LaSota strain. These results demonstrated that the HN protein C-terminal extension of NDV is not the determinant of the virus enteric tropism. "

After entering human bodies, CMs, as the aggregation of supramolecular ""imprinting templates"" , automatically seek supramolecular subjects that are matched with their ""imprinting templates"" in human meridians and organs for the purpose of self-recognition, self-organization, self-assembly and self-replication, so as to generate specific efficacy in meridians and organs, which is reflected as the meridian tropism phenomena at macro level.

Notably, DY TME is not detected in the secondary lymphoreticular system (LRS) tissues of infected hosts regardless of the route of inoculation. We found that similar to the lymphotropic strain HY TME, DY TME crosses mucosal epithelia, enters draining lymphatic vessels in underlying laminae propriae, and is transported to LRS tissues. Since DY TME causes disease once it enters the peripheral nervous system, the restriction in DY TME pathogenesis is due to its inability to establish infection in LRS tissues, not a failure of transport. To determine if LRS tissues can support DY TME formation, we performed protein misfolding cyclic amplification using DY PrPSc as the seed and spleen homogenate as the source of PrPC. We found that the spleen environment can support DY PrPSc formation, although at lower rates compared to lymphotropic strains, suggesting that the failure of DY TME to establish infection in the spleen is not due to the absence of a strain-specific conversion cofactor. Finally, we provide evidence that DY PrPSc is more susceptible to degradation when compared to PrPSc from other lymphotrophic strains.

We quantitatively investigated NPV tissue tropism by measuring mRNA levels of viral genes in 16 tissues from Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV)-infected B. mori larvae and found clear tissue tropism, i.e., BmNPV replicates poorly in the silk glands, midgut, and Malpighian tubule compared with other larval tissues. We next identified the viral genes determining tissue tropism in NPV infection by investigating the phenotypes of larvae infected with 44 BmNPV mutants in which one gene was functionally disrupted by a LacZ cassette insertion. We found that occlusion body (OB) production was markedly enhanced compared with that of the wild type in the middle silk glands (MSGs) of larvae infected with three mutants in which one of three tandemly arrayed genes (Bm7, Bm8, and Bm9) was disrupted. We generated additional mutants in which one or two genes of this gene cluster were partially deleted and showed that Bm8, also known as BV/ODV-E26, was solely required for the suppression of OB production in the MSGs of BmNPV-infected B. mori larvae. Western blotting showed that a LacZ cassette insertion in Bm7 or Bm9 resulted in aberrant expression of Bm8, presumably leading to abnormal OB production in the MSGs. Larval bioassays also revealed that disruption of Bm8 accelerated the death of B. mori larvae. These results suggest that the group I NPV-specific protein BV/ODV-E26 determines tissue tropism and virulence in host lepidopteran insects."

In addition, a modified promoter-PCR phenotypic assay was used to validate the genotypic tropism prediction on CRF01_AE. One hundred and five subtype B and 98 CRF01_AE antiretroviral-naive patients were recruited for this study. The viral env V3 region isolated from the patients was sequenced and analyzed by Geno2pheno (FPR=5.75% or 10%, Clonal or Clinical), position-specific scoring matrix (WebPSSM, x4r5 subtype B matrix), and the combination of 11/25 and net charge rules. Fifteen concordant and 22 discordant tropism genotyped CRF01_AE samples were further phenotyped by either enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay or an optimized promoter-PCR phenotypic assay. The prevalence of Dual/Mixed- or X4-tropic virus in antiretroviral-naive subtype CRF01_AE was 39.1%, which was significantly higher than subtype B (p<0.05), regardless of the choices of genotypic algorithms. Our phenotypic data proposed that a better genotypic tropism prediction for HIV-1 CRF01_AE would be using both Geno2pheno (FPR=10%, Clonal) and WebPSSM (x4r5 subtype B matrix) algorithms in combination. The sensitivity and specificity for this combination were 88.9% and 89.3%, respectively. The comparatively high prevalence of Dual/Mixed- or X4-tropic virus in CRF01_AE demonstrated the need for special attention to future treatment strategies."

While no difference in the levels of acute viral replication were observed across the different challenge doses, the severity of clinical signs, tracheal pathology and mortality were dose dependent. Both strains of virus persisted in the respiratory tract for up to 14 days post inoculation (dpi) and could be detected in the lung and feathers with sporadic detection in the liver, spleen or bursa. Given the prevalence of CL9 and CL10 in Australian poultry flocks, this study provides an important foundation for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the detection and prevention of ILTV."

This is a substudy of an epidemiological study (Pfizer A4001064). Plasma samples were selected to represent a large number of DM/X4 and R5 viruses. The HIV-1 env gene V3 loop was genotyped by Sanger sequencing (N=260) or 454 ""deep"" sequencing (N=280). Sequences were scored with g2p[coreceptor], PSSM X4/R5, PSSM SI/NSI, and PSSM subtype C matrices. Overall, non-B subtypes tropism prediction had similar concordance and apparent sensitivity and specificity as subtype B in predicting Trofile's results in both population sequencing (81.3%, 65.6%, and 90.5% versus 84.2%, 78.5%, and 88.2%) and 454 ""deep"" sequencing (82.3%, 80.0%, and 83.6% versus 86.8%, 92.0%, and 82.6%) using g2p[coreceptor].

Subtype C had greater concordance than subtype B regardless of sequencing methods. In conclusion, genotypic tropism prediction algorithms may be applied to non-B HIV-1 subtypes with caution. Collective analysis of non-B subtypes revealed a performance similar to subtype B, whereas a subtype-specific analysis revealed overestimation (subtype D) or underestimation (subtype A)."

We engineered H5N1 viruses with restricted cell tropism through the exploitation of cell type-specific microRNA expression by incorporating microRNA target sites into the viral genome. Restriction of H5N1 replication in endothelial cells via miR-126 ameliorated disease symptoms, prevented systemic viral spread and limited mortality, despite showing similar levels of peak viral replication in the lungs as compared to control virus-infected mice. Similarly, restriction of H5N1 replication in endothelial cells resulted in ameliorated disease symptoms and decreased viral spread in ferrets. Our studies demonstrate that H5N1 infection of endothelial cells results in excessive production of cytokines and reduces endothelial barrier integrity in the lungs, which culminates in vascular leakage and viral pneumonia. Importantly, our studies suggest a need for a combinational therapy that targets viral components, suppresses host immune responses, and improves endothelial barrier integrity for the treatment of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infections."

Results suggested that MCF‑7 cells exerted tumor tropism effects on ADSCs and this may be regulated by chemokines, such as the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)‑1δ and MIP‑3α. Additionally, ADSCs significantly induced tumorsphere formation in vitro and promoted tumorigenicity in vivo.

Previous studies have demonstrated the capability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to target these disseminated tumor cells and to serve as therapeutic delivery vehicles. Less is known about the factors involved in brain tumor tropism of NSCs and their interactions within the tumor environment. As gliomas progress and invade, an extensive modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) occurs. Tumor-ECM derived from six glioblastoma cell lines, ECM produced by normal human astrocytes and purified ECM compounds known to be upregulated in the glioma environment were analyzed for their effects on NSCs motility in vitro. We found that tumor-produced ECM was highly permissive for NSC migration. Laminin was the most permissive substrate for human NSC migration, and tenascin-C the strongest inducer of a directed human NSC migration (haptotaxis). A positive correlation between the degree of adhesion and migration of NSCs on different ECM compounds exists, as for glioma cells. Our in vitro data suggest that the ECM of malignant gliomas is a modulator of NSC migration. ECM proteins preferentially expressed in areas of glioma cell invasion may provide a permissive environment for NSC tropism to disseminated tumor cells."

Using a combination of in vivo tumor tropism studies and in vitro biophotonic chemotaxis assays, we observed that cell lines derived from glioma, medulloblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma efficiently chemoattracted ex vivo-expanded primary human T cells. We compared the chemokines secreted by tumor cell lines with high chemotactic activity with those that failed to elicit T cell chemotaxis (Daudi lymphoma, 10HTB neuroblastoma, and A2058 melanoma cells) and found a correlation between tumor-derived production of MCP-1/CCL2 (> or =10 ng/ml) and T cell chemotaxis. Chemokine immunodepletion studies confirmed that tumor-derived MCP-1 elicits effector T cell chemotaxis. Moreover, MCP-1 is sufficient for in vivo T cell tumor tropism as evidenced by the selective accumulation of i.v. administered firefly luciferase-expressing T cells in intracerebral xenografts of tumor transfectants secreting MCP-1.

Furthermore, we show inhibition of a key host protein for viral infection, site-1 protease (S1P), using the small molecule PF-429242 in the model pathogen arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) limits viral growth. By packaging PF-429242 in CPMV, we are able to control drug release and efficiently deliver the drug. This sets the groundwork for utilizing the natural tropism of CPMV for a therapeutic approach that specifically targets cell types most commonly subverted by chronic viruses."

Although integrin αVβ6 receptor has been identified as primary FMDV receptors in animals, their tissue distribution alone fails to explain these highly selective tropism-driven events. Thus, other molecular mechanisms must play roles in determining this tissue specificity. We hypothesized that differences in certain biological activities due to differential gene expression determine FMDV tropism and applied whole genome gene expression profiling to identify genes differentially expressed between FMDV-targeted and non-targeted tissues in terms of supporting primary infection, secondary replication including vesicular lesions, and persistence. Using statistical and bioinformatic tools to analyze the differential gene expression, we identified mechanisms that could explain FMDV tissue tropism based on its association with differential expression of integrin αVβ6 heterodimeric receptor (FMDV receptor), fibronectin (ligand of the receptor), IL-1 cytokines, death receptors and the ligands, and multiple genes in the biological pathways involved in extracellular matrix turnover and interferon signaling found in this study. Our results together with reported findings indicate that differences in (1) FMDV receptor availability and accessibility, (2) type I interferon-inducible immune response, and (3) ability to clear virus infected cells via death receptor signaling play roles in determining FMDV tissue tropism and the additional increase of high extracellular matrix turnover induced by FMDV infection, likely via triggering the signaling of highly expressed IL-1 cytokines, play a key role in the pathogenesis of vesicular lesions."

This review discusses the factors determining the vector tropism of rickettsiae. In brief, the vector tropism of rickettsiae species is basically consistent with their tropism toward cultured tick and insect cells. The mechanisms responsible for rickettsiae pathogenicity are also described. Recently, genomic analyses of rickettsiae have revealed that they possess several genes that are homologous to those affecting the pathogenicity of other bacteria. Analyses comparing the genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of rickettsiae have detected many factors that are related to rickettsial pathogenicity. It is also known that a reduction in the rickettsial genome has occurred during the course of its evolution. Interestingly, Rickettsia species with small genomes, such as Rickettsia prowazekii, are more pathogenic to humans than those with larger genomes. This review also examines the growth kinetics of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species of SFG rickettsiae (SFGR) in mammalian cells. The growth of non-pathogenic species is restricted in these cells, which is mediated, at least in part, by autophagy. The superinfection of non-pathogenic rickettsiae-infected cells with pathogenic rickettsiae results in an elevated yield of the non-pathogenic rickettsiae and the growth of the pathogenic rickettsiae. Autophagy is restricted in these cells. These results are discussed in this review."

In our model system, Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), this appears to be genotype-specific superinfection-exclusion, suggesting a simple recipe for cross-protection. However, this concept failed in field trials, which led us to examine the process of superinfection-exclusion more closely. We found that exclusion relies on the relative fitness of the primary versus the challenge isolates, and the host infected, and that significant differences in superinfection success could occur between isolates that differ by as few as 3 nucleotides. Furthermore, we found that exclusion was not uniform throughout the plant, but was tissue-specific. These data suggest that cross-protection is not a simple like-for-like process but a complex interaction between the primary and challenge isolates and the host."

However, it is still unclear how EBV accesses and transforms primary epithelial cells. Sixteen samples consisting of primary epithelial cells from the sphenoidal sinus or from tonsils were infected with GFP-tagged recombinant B95.8 EBVs produced in the 293 cell line. The rate of infection was assessed by counting GFP-positive cells and cells expressing viral proteins. Primary epithelial cells from all samples were found to be sensitive to EBV infection but there was a marked interindividual variation among the tested samples (2-48% positive cells). This suggests heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity to EBV infection in vivo and therefore possibly to EBV-associated diseases of the epithelium. The virus showed a preferential tropism for differentiated epithelial cells (p63 negative, involucrin positive). In all cases, infected cells expressed EBV lytic proteins but also the LMP1 protein. The viral tropism for differentiated cells and the permissivity of these cells for virus replication reproduced in vitro cardinal features of oral hairy leukoplakia. We have identified a source of EBV that shows unusually strong epitheliotropism for primary epithelial cells that will allow detailed analysis of virus-cell interactions during virus infection, replication and virus-mediated transformation."

The discovery of this protease-dependent virus tropism and pathogenicity has been triggered by the leading studies of the host-induced or -controlled modification of viruses by Homma et al. in 1970s. With the introduction of advanced protein analysis method, the observations by Homma et al. have been clearly explained by the cleavage activation of viral fusion glycoproteins by proteases. The molecular biological features of viruses, which show distinct protease specificity or dependency, have been also revealed by newly introduced nucleotide and molecular analysis method. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have multi-basic cleavage motif in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein and are activated proteolytically by furin. Furin is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and thereby HPAIVs have the potential to cause a systemic infection in infected animals. On the other hand, the HA cleavage site of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) and seasonal human influenza viruses is mono-basic and thus not recognized by furin. They are likely cleaved by protease(s) localized in specific organs or tissues. However, the protease(s), which cleaves mono-basic HA in vivo, has long been undetermined, although many proteases have been shown as candidates. Finally, recent studies using gene knocked out mice revealed that TMPRSS2, a member of type II transmembrane serine proteases, is responsible for the cleavage of influenza viruses with a mono-basic HA in vivo. A subsequent study further demonstrated that TMPRSS2 contributes to replication and pathology of emerging SARS- and MERS coronaviruses in vivo."

SRLV infections are spread across the world with the exception of Iceland. Success in controlling SRLV spread depends largely on the use of appropriate diagnostic tools, but the existence of a high genetic/antigenic variability among these viruses, the fluctuant levels of antibody against them and the low viral loads found in infected individuals hamper the diagnostic efficacy. SRLV have a marked in vivo tropism towards the monocyte/macrophage lineage and attempts have been made to identify the genome regions involved in tropism, with two main candidates, the LTR and env gene, since LTR contains primer binding sites for viral replication and the env-encoded protein (SU ENV), which mediates the binding of the virus to the host's cell and has hypervariable regions to escape the humoral immune response. Once inside the host cell, innate immunity may interfere with SRLV replication, but the virus develops counteraction mechanisms to escape, multiply and survive, creating a quasi-species and undergoing compartmentalization events. So far, the mechanisms of organ tropism involved in the development of different disease forms (neurological, arthritic, pulmonary and mammary) are unknown, but different alternatives are proposed. This is an overview of the current state of knowledge on SRLV genetic variability and its implications in tropism as well as in the development of alternative diagnostic assays."

One potential solution for improving bioavailability is the use of carrier cells such as human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have been suggested to have inherent tumor tropism. Here we investigated the capacity of capsid-modified adenoviruses to infect and replicate in MSCs. Further, biodistribution and tumor-killing efficacy of MSCs loaded with oncolytic adenoviruses were evaluated in orthotopic murine models of lung and breast cancer. In vitro, heparan sulfate proteoglycan- and alpha(v)beta integrin-targeted viruses enhanced gene delivery to bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived MSCs up to 11,000-fold over adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5). Infectivity-enhanced oncolytic adenoviruses showed notably higher rates of cytolysis of in vitro-passaged MSCs in comparison with wild-type virus. In vivo, intravenously injected MSCs homed primarily to the lungs, and virus was released into advanced orthotopic breast and lung tumors for therapeutic efficacy and increased survival. When the same dose of virus was injected intravenously without MSCs, only transduction of the liver was seen. These results suggest that MSCs loaded with oncolytic adenoviruses might be a useful approach for improving the bioavailability of systemically administered oncolytic adenoviruses."

CD134 expression promotes viral binding and renders cells permissive for viral entry, productive infection, and syncytium formation. Infection is CXCR4-dependent, analogous to infection with X4 strains of HIV. Thus, despite the evolutionary divergence of the feline and human lentiviruses, both viruses use receptors that target the virus to a subset of cells that are pivotal to the acquired immune response. Further, we applied the new method for FIV receptor to Ebola virus entry factors with some modifications, and identified receptor-type tyrosine kinases, Axl and Dtk (members of Tyro3 family).

In contrast, the combined 11/25 and net charge rule was highly specific (98%) but rather insensitive (64%). We thus identified subtype CRF01-AE determinants in the V3 region that are associated with CXCR4 use and developed a new simple rule for optimizing the genotypic prediction of CRF01-AE tropism. The concordance between the predicted CRF01-AE genotype and the phenotype was 95% for the clonal data set. We then validated this algorithm by analyzing the data from 44 patients infected with subtype CRF01-AE, whose tropism was determined using a recombinant phenotypic entry assay and V3-loop bulk sequencing. The CRF01-AE genotypic tool was 70% sensitive and 96% specific for predicting CXCR4 use, and the concordance between genotype and phenotype was 84%, approaching the concordance obtained for predicting the tropism of HIV-1 subtype B.

Detecting and quantifying HIV-1 drug resistance has therefore become the standard of care when designing new antiretroviral regimens. The sensitivity of Sanger sequencing-based HIV-1 genotypic assays is limited by its inability to identify minority members of the quasispecies, i.e., it only detects variants present above ~ 20% of the viral population, thus, failing to detect minority variants below this threshold. It is clear that deep sequencing-based HIV-1 genotyping assays are an important step change towards accurately monitoring HIV-infected individuals."

All the discordances were attributable to the prediction of R5 in RNA and X4/dual-mixed in DNA. HIV-2 genotypic tropism test based on proviral DNA is a suitable tool for tropism determination in HIV-2-infected patients with low or undetectable viral load."

In tumors, there is a substantial intra- and intertumoral variability in CAR expression. The CAR-negative cells generally exhibit very low infectability. Since the fiber knob is a primary mediator of Ad5 binding to the cell surface, improved infectivity of Ad5-based vectors as oncolytic agents may be achieved via genetic modifications of this domain. The strategies to modify or broaden tropism and increase transduction efficiency of Ad5-based vectors include: 1) an incorporation of a targeting peptide into the fiber knob domain (the HI loop and/or C-terminus); 2) fiber knob serotype switching, or pseudotyping, by constructing chimeric fibers consisting of the knob domain derived from an alternate serotype (e.g., Ad5/3 or Ad5/35 chimeras), which binds to receptor(s) other than CAR (e.g., desmoglein 2/DSG2 and/or CD46); 3) ""fiber complex mosaicism"", an approach of combining serotype chimerism with peptide ligand(s) incorporation (e.g., Ad5/3-RGD); 4) ""dual fiber mosaicism"" by expressing two separate fibers with distinct receptor-binding capabilities on the same viral particle (e.g., Ad5-5/3 or Ad5-5/σ1); 5) fiber xenotyping by replacing the knob and shaft domains of wild-type Ad5 fiber protein with fibritin trimerization domain of T4 bacteriophage or σ1 attachment protein of reovirus. Other genetic approaches to increase the CAR-independent transduction efficiency include insertion of a targeting peptide into the hypervariable region of the capsid protein hexon or fusion to the C-terminus of pIX. Finally, we consider a yet unsolved molecular mechanism of liver targeting by Ad5-based vectors (CAR-, integrin-, fiber shaft KKTK motif-, and hepatic heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans-independent, but fiber-, hexon- and blood factor X-dependent)."

Numerous naturally occurring serotypes have been used to target cells in various tissues. There is a strong need for fast and dynamic methods which efficiently unravel viral tropism in whole organs. Ultramicroscopy (UM) is a novel fluorescence microscopy technique that images optically cleared undissected specimens, achieving good resolutions at high penetration depths while being non-destructive. UM was applied to obtain high-resolution 3D analysis of AAV transduction in adult mouse brains, especially in the hippocampus, a region of interest for Alzheimer's disease therapy. We separately or simultaneously compared transduction efficacies for commonly used serotypes (AAV9 and AAVrh10) using fluorescent reporter expression. We provide a detailed comparative and quantitative analysis of the transduction profiles. UM allowed a rapid analysis of marker fluorescence expression in neurons with intact projections deep inside the brain, in defined anatomical structures. Major hippocampal neuronal transduction was observed with both vectors, with slightly better efficacy for AAV9 in UM. Glial response and synaptic marker expression did not change post transduction.We propose UM as a novel valuable complementary tool to efficiently and simultaneously unravel tropism of different viruses in a single non-dissected adult rodent brain."
