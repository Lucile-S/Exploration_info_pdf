This study compared three of the most efficacious AAV vectors known to date in a mouse model of retinal degeneration (rd1 mouse) and macaque and human retinal explants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a ubiquitous promoter was packaged into three AAV capsids: AAV2/8(Y733F), AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/2(7m8). Overall, AAV2/2(7m8) transduced the largest area of retina and resulted in the highest level of GFP expression, followed by AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/8(Y733F). AAV2/2(7m8) and AAV2/2(quad Y-F) both resulted in similar patterns of transduction whether they were injected intravitreally or subretinally. AAV2/8(Y733F) transduced a significantly smaller area of retina when injected intravitreally compared with subretinally. Retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells and retinal pigment epithelium expressed relatively high levels of GFP in the mouse retina, whereas amacrine cells expressed low levels of GFP and bipolar cells were infrequently transduced. Cone cells were the most frequently transduced cell type in macaque retina explants, whereas Müller cells were the predominant transduced cell type in human retinal explants. Of the AAV serotypes tested, AAV2/2(7m8) was the most effective at transducing a range of cell types in degenerate mouse retina and macaque and human retinal explants.",8256,298,0.03609496124031008,,"['AAV', 'AAV2/8(Y733F)', 'AAV2/2(quad Y-F)', 'AAV2/2(7m8)', 'AAV2/2', 'AAV2/8', 'AAV2/5', 'AAV2/9', 'AAV2/2(Y272, 444, 500, 730F)', 'AAV-GFP', 'AAV2/2(7 m8)', 'AAV2/2(quadY-F)', 'AAV2/2(7m8)-GFP', 'AAV2/8(Y733F)-GFP', 'AAV2/2(quad Y-F)-GFP', 'AAV2', 'AAV2-4YF-CMV-GFP', 'AAV7m8', 'AAV2-', 'AAV8BP2', 'AAV8', 'AAV-mediated']",PMC5746594,28872643

Because of the recent success in reprogramming islet-derived cells into functional β cells in animal models, we constructed 2 highly complex barcoded replication competent capsid shuffled libraries and selected for high-transducing variants on primary human islets. We describe the generation of a chimeric AAV capsid (AAV-KP1) that facilitates transduction of primary human islet cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived β cells with up to 10-fold higher efficiency compared with previously studied best-in-class AAV vectors. Remarkably, this chimeric capsid also enabled transduction of both mouse and human hepatocytes at very high levels in a humanized chimeric mouse model, thus providing a versatile vector that has the potential to be used in both preclinical testing and human clinical trials for liver-based diseases and diabetes.",8407,295,0.03508980611395266,,"['AAV', 'AAV-KP1', 'AAV-mediated', 'AAV8', 'AAV8-based', 'AAV6', 'AAV5', 'AAV2', 'AAV-DJ', 'AAV-LK03', 'AAV3B', 'AAVs', 'AAV-expressing', 'AAV1', 'AAV8-derived', 'AAV-FLuc', 'AAV-KP2', 'AAV-KP3', 'AAV-', 'AAV-KP', 'AAV-Td', 'AAV-PHP', 'AAV4', 'AAV9hu14', 'AAV12', 'AAV-bovine', 'AAV-avian', 'AAV-CAG-GFP', 'AAV-CAG-FLuc', 'AAV-CAG-tdTomato', 'AAV-3B', 'AAV-Mediated', 'AAV-6']",PMC6948855,31723052

Following its extensive prior use in the best characterized AAV serotype 2 (AAV2), recent reports also indicate the potential of other AAV isolates as scaffolds for peptide display. In this study, we systematically explored the respective capacities of 13 different AAV capsid variants to tolerate 27 peptides inserted on the surface followed by production of reporter-encoding vectors. Single-round screening in pre-arrayed 96-well plates permitted rapid and simple identification of superior vectors in >90 cell types, including T cells and primary cells. Notably, vector performance depended not only on the combination of capsid, peptide, and cell type, but also on the position of the inserted peptide and the nature of flanking residues. For optimal data availability and accessibility, all results were assembled in a searchable online database offering multiple output styles. Finally, we established a reverse-transduction pipeline based on vector pre-spotting in 96- or 384-well plates that facilitates high-throughput library panning.
